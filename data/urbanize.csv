City Council approves mixed-use development at 1200 W. Fulton,"The Chicago City Council has approved a two-tower mixed-use development at 1200 W. Fulton. Planned by Fulton Street Cos. and JDL Development, the project site is bound by W. Fulton St to the south, N. Racine Ave to the east, W. Carroll Ave to the north and adjacent structures to the west.  Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the mixed-use development will include 1,079 residential units in two towers with a large podium that holds 24,000 square feet of ground floor retail space, 1,079 bike parking spaces, 440 car parking spaces, and approximately 90,000 square feet dedicated to a lifestyle fitness tenant.  With a design language intended to create similar yet distinct towers, the 37-story north tower will stand 465 feet holding 521 residential units while the 44-swtory western tower will have 558 residential units.  On the ground floor, the retail space will activate all three frontages as well as the large public open space at the intersection of W. Fulton St and N. Racine Ave. The northern tower will have its residential lobby along W. Carroll Ave while the western tower’s residential lobby will be along W. Fulton St. Two separate bike rooms both on the ground floor will hold the planned 1,079 bike spaces for residents. Parking garage access will be from N. Racine Ave with loading access off of W. Carroll Ave. The entry into the fitness center tenant space will face into the public open space. Within the podium, the planned parking spaces will occupy space on the second and third floors, with 150 spaces planned for the fitness tenant and retail and the remaining 290 designated for tenants. During the community meeting, the developers expressed willingness to create public access to parking if there were unused spaces. Residential units will screen the parking along W. Carroll Ave and N. Racine Ave.  While the name of the fitness operator hasn’t been released, the 90,000 square feet of space it will occupy is located on the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors of the podium. The scheme includes some residential units in the western tower on these floors as well. An outdoor deck will be included for the fitness tenant.  The podium will be topped with a residential amenity deck on the seventh floor with the residential towers rising above. The northern tower’s 521 units will be split into 193 studios, 255 one-beds, and 73 two-beds. The western tower’s 558 units will include a mix of 224 studios, 194 one-beds, and 140 two-beds. The development will meet the 20% affordability requirement with 216 of the rental apartments being set aside as affordable.  To meet sustainability requirements, the development will implement water use reduction, construction waste diversion, will exceed energy code by 5%, provide bike parking, plant trees, install over 50% green roofs, is located in proximity to transit, install EV charging stations, and install CTA digital displays. With approval from the Chicago City Council secured, the site will be rezoned from M2-3 to DX-7 with an overall Planned Development designation. A 4.5 FAR bonus would be added by paying approximately $9.7 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.  While a specific timeline for construction hasn’t been announced, the development team has split the project in a way that the two towers can be phased. If phasing was implemented, the northern tower and all commercial space in the building would be built first including the fitness tenant and the western tower would be added in a second phase.  ",Fulton Market

New renderings emerge for 370 N. Morgan,"A set of fresh renderings have been released showing the revised design for the new mixed-use development located at 370 N. Morgan. Planned by Vista Property Group, the development will be the first phase of their three-tower mixed-use development at the intersection of W. Kinzie St and N. Morgan St. The site is bound by W. Kinzie St to the north, N. Morgan St to the east, the Metra tracks to the south, and N. Carpenter St to the west. With Antunovich Associates in charge of the redesigned project, the renderings show the revised massing of the tower that was shortened by cutting the height by three floors and going from 410 feet down to 380 feet in height. The residential tower has been widened to stretch the entire width of the site, accommodating a similar unit count in a shorter massing. The building’s facade has been revised to use a dark metal and glass window wall system with brick wrapping the podium.  With a total count of 493 units, the apartments will be split into 154 efficiency units and 339 dwelling units. The parking count was reduced from 222 to 190 spaces and 80% of them will be electric-vehicle ready. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will face N. Morgan St with a metal canopy reaching out into the new landscaped plaza that occupies the corner and overlooks the intersection. Retail space will occupy the rest of the street frontage between the residential entry and the Metra tracks. Management and leasing offices will be located along Kinzie behind the lobby and a bike room with 494 spaces will occupy the rest of the Kinzie St frontage. Loading and parking access will be from N. Carpenter St.  With a demolition permit issued, work has already begun to clear the former Fox Deluxe building at 370 N. Morgan to make way for a new mixed-use development. With Skender Construction set to be the general contractor, new construction permits have been filed and are awaiting issuance. The developer is quoting a Q1 2025 start for construction.  ",Fulton Market
Demo permit issued to make way for 370 N. Morgan,"A demolition permit has been issued for the former Fox Deluxe building at 370 N. Morgan to make way for a new mixed-use development. Planned by Vista Property Group, the development will be the first phase of their three-tower mixed-use development at the intersection of W. Kinzie St and N. Morgan St. The site is bound by W. Kinzie St to the north, N. Morgan St to the east, the Metra tracks to the south, and N. Carpenter St to the west. With Antunovich Associates recently replacing Gensler as the architect, the 370 N. Morgan tower has undergone some slight modifications to its program and massing. With a split of 154 efficiency units and 339 dwelling units, the unit count has been increased by three from 492 to 495, while the parking count has been reduced from 222 to 190. 80% of the parking spaces will be electric-vehicle ready instead of 100%. The massing of the tower has been shortened by cutting the height by three floors and going from 410 feet down to 380 feet in height. While the podium has largely remained the same, the residential tower has been widened to stretch the entire width of the site, accommodating the similar unit count in a shorter massing. The building’s facade has been revised to use dark metal paneling and slab edge covers and the podium will use acid etched glass instead of fritted glass with perforated metal paneling around the parking floors. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will remain overlooking the intersection of Kinzie and Morgan, with a retail space occupying the rest of the N. Morgan St frontage. A new landscaped plaza will front both spaces overlooking the intersection. In lieu of more retail space along W. Kinzie St, the revised plan will locate management and leasing offices along Kinzie behind the lobby and a bike room with 494 spaces will occupy the rest of the Kinzie St frontage. Loading and parking access will remain from N. Carpenter St.  With the demolition permit issued, demolition contractor Heneghan Wrecking & Excavating can clear the property to make way for the new development.

City Council approves two-tower development at 170 N. May and 175 N. Racine,"The Chicago City Council has approved LG Group’s revised plans for a two-tower mixed-use development at 170 N. May and 175 N. Racine. The former Amylu Foods project site is an L-shaped parcel bound by W. Lake St, N. May St, W. Randolph St, and N. Racine Ave, with two buildings at the corner of W. Randolph St and N. Racine Ave not included in this parcel.  Originally approved back in 2021, the previous design by Gensler, called for one 29-story tower that would have risen 330 feet tall. Holding 486 apartments, the building would have held retail space on the ground floor and 261 parking spaces.  With bKL Architecture on board for the new version, the site will become home to two residential towers. Rising along N. May St, the first phase tower at 170 N. May would be the shorter of the two, standing 25 stories tall reaching 315 feet in height. The smaller building would have 287 dwelling units, 252 parking spaces, and 287 bike parking spaces.  The second phase of the project would see the construction of a 38-story tower reaching 450 feet in height at 175 N. Racine. Rising at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Racine Ave, the building would have 380 residential units, 257 parking spaces, and 380 bike parking spaces. The overall development will satisfy the ARO requirements by providing 133 affordable units across the two buildings. On the ground floor, the residential entry for Phase 1 would be midblock on N. May St with some retail space at the corner of W. Lake St and N. May St. A large retail space would occupy all the ground floor south of the midblock alley towards the corner of W. Randolph St and N. May St. Phase 2 would have its residential lobby along N. Racine Ave, with retail space at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Racine Ave. The bike room would be located along W. Lake St, with loading and parking access for both buildings from the midblock alley connection.  The design sculpts the buildings with staggered setbacks that step back from W. Randolph St to push the density up toward W. Lake St while still keeping setbacks from the noise of the L tracks. The very long podium facade along N. May St is broken down with a brick design for the grocer and portion down to W. Randolph St, with the tower facade coming down to the ground midblock to the residential entry. The northern portion uses a metal facade on the podium instead of brick to reference the industrial qualities seen in the metal L track structures. With Confluence serving as the landscape architect, the design will reclaim some of the angled parking along W. Randolph St for more space for plantings as well as an opportunity for outdoor seating. Curb bump outs will be added along W. Randolph St and W. Lake St. Seating elements with planters will be included along the L tracks.  With approvals secured, the site’s existing Planned Development will be amended to allow for the revised $300 million development. With a grocer interested in the space, LG Group intends to start Phase 1 as soon as Spring 2025 and will build the second phase after the first building is completed.  ",Fulton Market

Landmarks approves demo to make way for rehab at 900 W. Fulton,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved the demolition of the existing structure at 906 W. Fulton as part of a mixed-use rehab planned. Proposed by Midwest Property Group LTD, the project site is located at the northwest corner of the intersection of W. Fulton Market and N. Peoria St. Designed by NORR, the project would rehabilitate, demolish, and rebuild three structures as part one combined development. The four-story contributing structure at 900 W. Fulton on the corner will be rehabbed and renovated, with a new retail storefront and a residential entry along N. Peoria St.  The one and two-story structure at 906 W. Fulton will be demolished and replaced by a five-story mixed-use structure. The building’s design has a four-story brick facade along the street wall with a fifth floor addition setback 10 feet from the street and clad in metal paneling.  The third portion of the project is the contributing building at 910 W. Fulton. As part of the development, the front facade will be restored while the structure behind will be demolished due to its deteriorated condition. The new reconstruction behind will fill out the first two floors with the third-floor setback 15 feet from the street above the historic facade. With approval secured from both the Permit Review Committee and Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the project can move forward with getting the demolition permit issued. A timeline for the project is currently unknown and no permits have been filed.  ",Fulton Market
Sterling Bay and Wheelock Street Capital Sell Hyatt House-Fulton Market,"Sterling Bay and Wheelock Street Capital have announced the sale of Hyatt House-Fulton Market to Ohio-based Rockbridge Capital. Located at 105 N. May in the Fulton Market neighborhood, the 200-key, extended-stay hotel includes 5,224 square-feet of retail space on the ground floor, which is now fully leased to popular breakfast restaurant The Original Pancake House. “Hyatt House was an exciting and important development for Fulton Market, and we are pleased to see the property fully leased before the sale,” said Andy Gloor, CEO of Sterling Bay. “Our ability, in close partnership with Wheelock, to successfully take such a project from construction to financing, leasing and sale is a testament to our team’s incredible track record in commercial property development.”  This sale is the latest activity in a series of Fulton Market listings for the firm, which has identified the properties as opportunities to further their vision for development in Chicago.  The Original Pancake House will operate its sixth Chicagoland location—and first in Fulton Market—in the ground floor retail space at Hyatt House, bringing an accessible, family-friendly breakfast option to Fulton Market’s bustling dining scene. The restaurant plans to open in late spring or early summer 2025.  Since Sterling Bay and Wheelock delivered Hyatt House in 2019, the 200-key property has been the only extended-stay and Hyatt-branded hotel in the neighborhood. Designed by Eckenhoff Saunders Architects, the hotel has welcomed thousands of guests looking to take advantage of Fulton Market’s range of business, dining and entertainment offerings. Hyatt House builds on the neighborhood’s live-work-play environment with its own amenities, including an indoor rooftop pool, sky deck with expansive city views, fitness center, and full-service lobby bar.

City Council approves mixed-use development at 345 N. Aberdeen,"The Chicago City Council has approved Sterling Bay’s plan for a mixed-use development at 345 N. Aberdeen. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the project site is a full-block lot bound by N. Carpenter St to the east, W. Carroll Ave to the south, N. Aberdeen St to the west, and the Metra tracks to the north.  Designed by Gensler, the new development will stand 473 feet tall over 44 floors, with 559 residential units, 20% or 112 of which will be set aside as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. The building will also provide 255 parking spaces and 559 bike parking spaces. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will occupy the southeastern corner of the building, facing the corner of W. Carroll Ave and N. Carpenter St. The building’s 10,000 square feet of retail space will face the corner of W. Carroll Ave and N. Aberdeen St. Mechanical space will stretch along the north side of the ground floor along the tracks, with loading fronting N. Carpenter St and the parking access from N. Aberdeen St.  After studying a few iterations of the building's massing, the north/south oriented bar building was selected. The building was shifted to the east to open up some public space along the western side of the property and the tower’s massing was evolved to create a more vertical expression and break up the length of the facade. Along W. Carroll Ave, the tower expression reaches down to the ground to announce the residential entry. Topping out at 473 feet tall, the building’s facade will be made up of a metal and glass window wall on the tower and a brick expression on the podium.  With the zoning change approved, the property will be rezoned from M2-3 to DX-7 with a Planned Development designation. A 4.5 FAR bonus would also be secured by paying approximately $5 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. At the same time, Sterling Bay is looking to sell the property. During the previous community meeting, a representative from the development team commented that all options are on the table for developing the site and they would be open to a joint venture or collaboration to facilitate the development.

Construction tops out at 919 W. Fulton,"Skender recently celebrated the topping out of the structure for 919 W. Fulton, an 11-story, 409,000-square-foot-mixed-use office building. Located at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Sangamon St, the project is being developed by Fulton Street Companies and JDL Development. Financial backing for the project was secured through strategic partnerships with Bank OZK and Manulife Investment Management. SNK Capital assumed the pivotal role as the lead equity investment partner. Designed by Morris Adjmi Architects and FitzGerald, the 400,000 square foot mixed-use building is set to become home to the headquarters of Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, who will occupy 112,000 square feet of space in the 11-story building. On the ground floor, Gibsons Restaurant Group will occupy 15,500 square feet of the planned retail space.  Once completed, the amenity-rich development will feature floor-to-ceiling windows, several outdoor terraces, a rooftop lounge and bar, several conference and coworking spaces, and a state-of-the-art fitness center for tenants to enjoy. A full-depth, nearly football field-sized basement will provide parking for up to 80 vehicles, a ComEd vault and space for the building’s mechanical equipment. The building will have two main lobbies, one on Sangamon and one corridor that will connect access between Fulton and Lake. Upon completion, the building’s address will be changed to 217 N Sangamon. The project puts a deep focus on air quality, material selection, energy efficiency, wellness and environmental impact, as the building is pursuing WELL and LEED Silver certifications. The topping-out milestone marks the end of the structural phase of construction as the project team works toward the building’s completion and anticipated opening in 2025. ",Fulton Market
Revised scheme revealed for mixed-use development at 23 S. Sangamon,"Developers Fern Hill and Free Market Ventures have announced a revised scheme for their mixed-use development at 23 S. Sangamon. Located at the northeastern corner of S. Sangamon St and W. Monroe St, the developers most recently planned a 19-story condominium tower that was approved back in 2021. With Eckenhoff Saunders and Interactive Design Architects designing the project, the new design calls for a three-story community center and fieldhouse with racket and basketball facilities topped by a residential building with 283 residential units and 73 car parking spaces. Rising 357 feet tall, the 33-story tower would include 57 affordable residential units, representing the required 20% affordability by the ARO. The three-story community center fronting Bartelme Park will be entirely privately funded but accessible to the public at no cost through a newly formed 501(c)3 non-profit operator. The new, privately funded facilities will provide many of the resources and programs that have been consistently requested by many voices in the community through an unrelated, but similar, public process to establish a publicly funded Chicago Park District fieldhouse for the neighboring Skinner Park. The community center has capacity to include a reception cafe, open public lounge, restrooms, family changing rooms, flexible event/exhibition space, large group events, indoor movie nights, study rooms, outdoor seating, and storage. The fieldhouse has space to support active and healthy lifestyles with a full-size basketball court and multiple racket sports including separate pickleball and paddle tennis facilities, convenient restroom and locker room amenities, and a 125-foot-long tree-top terrace overlooking Bartelme Park to the south. “The development team is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with community, aldermanic, and City leadership and staff, to grow tax revenues while offering a more inclusive and equitable neighborhood vision that leverages a unique public-private partnership model to deliver unrivaled community benefits supporting Mary Bartelme Park and the entire West Loop Community,” said Nick Anderson, President of Fern Hill, in a statement. The developers have submitted the zoning application to the city to amend the existing Planned Development, triggering a zoning process that will include review by the community, alderman, and Chicago Department of Planning and Development. Approvals will be needed from local Alderman Conway, the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the City Council. ",Fulton Market

Fulton to the local community. With an area of approximately 93,000 square feet, the project site is bound by W. Fulton St to the south, N. Racine Ave to the east, W. Carroll Ave to the north and adjacent structures to the west.  Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the mixed-use development will include 1,079 residential units in two towers with a large podium that holds 24,000 square feet of ground floor retail space, 1,079 bike parking spaces, 440 car parking spaces, and approximately 90,000 square feet dedicated to a lifestyle fitness tenant.  With a design language intended to create similar yet distinct towers, the 37-story north tower will stand 465 feet holding 521 residential units while the 44-swtory western tower will have 558 residential units.  On the ground floor, the retail space will activate all three frontages as well as the large public open space at the intersection of W. Fulton St and N. Racine Ave. The northern tower will have its residential lobby along W. Carroll Ave while the western tower’s residential lobby will be along W. Fulton St. Two separate bike rooms on the ground floor will hold the planned 1,079 bike spaces for residents. Parking garage access will be from N. Racine Ave with loading access off of W. Carroll Ave. The entry into the fitness center tenant space will face into the public open space. Within the podium, the planned parking spaces will occupy space on the second and third floors, with 150 spaces planned for the fitness tenant and retail and the remaining 290 designated for tenants. During the community meeting, the developers expressed willingness to create public access to parking if there were unused spaces. Residential units will screen the parking along W. Carroll Ave and N. Racine Ave.  While the development team could not name the fitness operator that the space is designed for, the 90,000 square feet of space is planned to occupy the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors of the podium.

An outdoor deck will be included for the fitness tenant.  The podium will be topped with a residential amenity deck on the seventh floor with the residential towers rising above. The northern tower’s 521 units will be split into 193 studios, 255 one-beds, and 73 two-beds. The western tower’s 558 units will include a mix of 224 studios, 194 one-beds, and 140 two-beds. The development will meet the 20% affordability requirement with 217 of the rental apartments being set aside as affordable.  To meet sustainability requirements, the development will implement water use reduction, construction waste diversion, will exceed energy code by 5%, provide bike parking, plant trees, install over 50% green roofs, is located in proximity to transit, install EV charging stations, and install CTA digital displays. To allow for the project, the developers are seeking to rezone the site from M2-3 to DX-7 with an overall Planned Development designation. A 4.5 FAR bonus would be added by paying approximately $9 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. The developers are hoping to proceed to the Chicago Plan Commission for approval in August of this year and proceed with approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.  During the meeting, Jim Letchinger from JDL stated that they are prepared to start construction as soon as they can, but acknowledged the complex financial climate that makes financing projects difficult. The team has considered phasing the project to allow it to begin construction sooner. If phasing was implemented, the northern tower and all commercial space in the building would be built first including the fitness tenant and the western tower would be added in a second phase.  ",Fulton Market
Mixed-use development at 170 N. May and 175 N. Racine heads to Plan Commission,"The Chicago Plan Commission later this month will review LG Group’s revised plans for a two-tower mixed-use development at 170 N. May and 175 N. Racine. The former Amylu Foods project site is an L-shaped parcel bound by W. Lake St, N. May St, W. Randolph St, and N. Racine Ave, with two buildings at the corner of W. Randolph St and N. Racine Ave not included in this parcel.  Originally approved back in 2021, the previous design by Gensler, called for one 29-story tower that would have risen 330 feet tall. Holding 486 apartments, the building would have held retail space on the ground floor and 261 parking spaces.  With bKL Architecture on board for the new version, the site will become home to two residential towers. Rising along N. May St, the first phase tower at 170 N. May would be the shorter of the two, standing 25 stories tall reaching 315 feet in height. The smaller building would have 287 dwelling units, 252 parking spaces, and 287 bike parking spaces.  The second phase of the project would see the construction of a 38-story tower reaching 450 feet in height at 175 N. Racine. Rising at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Racine Ave, the building would have 380 residential units, 257 parking spaces, and 380 bike parking spaces. The overall development will satisfy the ARO requirements by providing 133 affordable units across the two buildings. On the ground floor, the residential entry for Phase 1 would be midblock on N. May St with some retail space at the corner of W. Lake St and N. May St. A large retail space would occupy all the ground floor south of the midblock alley towards the corner of W. Randolph St and N. May St. Phase 2 would have its residential lobby along N. Racine Ave, with retail space at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Racine Ave. The bike room would be located along W. Lake St, with loading and parking access for both buildings from the midblock alley connection.  The design sculpts the buildings with staggered setbacks that step back from W. Randolph St to push the density up toward W. Lake St while still keeping setbacks from the noise of the L tracks. The very long podium facade along N. May St is broken down with a brick design for the grocer and portion down to W. Randolph St, with the tower facade coming down to the ground midblock to the residential entry. The northern portion uses a metal facade on the podium instead of brick to reference the industrial qualities seen in the metal L track structures.   With Confluence serving as the landscape architect, the design will reclaim some of the angled parking along W. Randolph St for more space for plantings as well as an opportunity for outdoor seating. Curb bump outs will be added along W. Randolph St and W. Lake St. Seating elements with planters will be included along the L tracks.  If the Chicago Plan Commission approves the project, the development team will then go before the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council to get final approvals. With a grocer interested in the space, LG Group intends to start Phase 1 as soon as Spring 2025 and will build the second phase after the first building is completed.  ",Fulton Market
Plan Commission approves mixed-use development at 345 N. Aberdeen,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved Sterling Bay’s plan for a mixed-use development at 345 N. Aberdeen. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the project site is a full-block lot bound by N. Carpenter St to the east, W. Carroll Ave to the south, N. Aberdeen St to the west, and the Metra tracks to the north.  Designed by Gensler, the new development will stand 473 feet tall over 44 floors, with 559 residential units, 20% or 112 of which will be set aside as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. The building will also provide 255 parking spaces and 559 bike parking spaces. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will occupy the southeastern corner of the building, facing the corner of W. Carroll Ave and N. Carpenter St. The building’s 10,000 square feet of retail space will face the corner of W. Carroll Ave and N. Aberdeen St. Mechanical space will stretch along the north side of the ground floor along the tracks, with loading fronting N. Carpenter St and the parking access from N. Aberdeen St.  After studying a few iterations of the building's massing, the north/south oriented bar building was selected. The building was shifted to the east to open up some public space along the western side of the property and the tower’s massing was evolved to create a more vertical expression and break up the length of the facade. Along W. Carroll Ave, the tower expression reaches down to the ground to announce the residential entry. Topping out at 473 feet tall, the building’s facade will be made up of a metal and glass window wall on the tower and a brick expression on the podium.  Sterling Bay is looking to rezone the property from M2-3 to DX-7 with a Planned Development designation. A 4.5 FAR bonus would also be secured by paying approximately $5 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. With approval from the Chicago Plan Commission, the project will now seek approval from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. At the same time, Sterling Bay is looking to sell the property. During the previous community meeting, a representative from the development team commented that all options are on the table for developing the site and they would be open to a joint venture or collaboration to facilitate the development.

City Council approves residential development at 1220 W. Van Buren,"The Chicago City Council has approved a residential development planned at 1220 W. Van Buren. Located just west of the intersection of W. Van Buren St and S. Racine Ave, the conversion is being planned by Base 3 Development. Designed by Filoramo Talsma Architecture, the development will rehabilitate the historic building that was originally built in 1910 as a manufacturing building.

Aldi will open store in mixed-use development at 1016 W. Jackson,"Mavrek Development has announced that grocery chain Aldi will anchor the base of their mixed-use development at 1016 W. Jackson. Located at the intersection of W. Jackson Blvd and S. Morgan St, the property includes an existing five-story office building, a two-story commercial structure, and a large parking lot that will all be replaced as part of the project. Designed by Eckenhoff Saunders, the development will stand 25 stories tall at a height of 275 feet. 380 apartments will be included in the building with 76 affordable apartments. Aldi will occupy the almost 22,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. Parking in the building will include 163 parking stalls and 380 bike parking spaces.  First approved without the expanded podium and grocery store, the revised design for the project refines the original design language with a gridded metal facade volume intersecting a glass volume. The design uses a corten steel frame with a glass and aluminum glazing system. In this revised version, the glass volume wraps around to the north facade to lighten the massing of the building as seen from the north. The project’s podium has been designed with two facade expressions to break up the long frontage along W. Jackson Blvd. The dark toned brick of the corner volume of the building contrasts with the gridded metal facade used on the tower portion of the site.  On the ground floor, the majority of the enlarged floor plan will be used by Aldi. The paseo will lead back to the residential entry and has been redesigned without columns to address safety concerns and allow for more light to enter the area. Parking access and loading for the grocer will be from S. Morgan St with loading access for residents from the alley.  With the lease signed by Aldi, Mavrek is close to securing construction financing. Construction on the $155 million development could start in Q1 2025 with the grocery store opening in the second half of 2026. Permit filings show Skender will serve as the general contractor.

Multi-tower condominium development proposed at 1325 W. Fulton,"A zoning application has been filed for a three-tower condominium development at 1325 W. Fulton. Proposed by Sulo Development and Sterling Bay, the project site is  a full block site along W. Fulton St from N. Elizabeth St to N. Ada St. Currently a vacant property, the site was previously envisioned as an office development site. With New York-based KPF teaming up with local Park Fowler Plus, the project’s design consists of three towers on the site, with one on each corner and one centered along W. Fulton St. The building’s will have their individual residential lobbies at their base with a restaurant located midblock under the center tower. Two motor courts are located between the three buildings and connect into the parking podium that will hold a total of 364 parking spaces for the buildings.

The center tower, located in Subarea B, will hold 54 condos in a 301-foot-tall tower. The western tower, situated in Subarea C, will be the largest building, holding 106 condos in a 538-foot-tall building. Outdoor amenity decks will be located on top of the parking podium that stretches across the entire site. As a residential development, affordability requirements still apply for the condominium project. In lieu of building affordable units, the developers will pay a fee in-lieu of approximately $5.3 million to cover their affordability requirement. To allow for the scope of the project, the developers are seeking to rezone the site from M2-3 to DX-7 with an overall Planned Development designation. The team will pay into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to get an additional 4.5 FAR bonus.

Permit issued for adaptive reuse at 801 W. Madison,"A renovation permit has been issued for the adaptive reuse of the former Mid-City Trust & Savings Bank Building. Located at 801 W. Madison, the building occupies the southwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Halsted St. Purchased in 2022, Experiential Capital Group is leading the redevelopment of the building. With Pappageorge Haymes Partners serving as the architect, the project will rehabilitate the exterior and convert the interior into a hotel operated by The Neighborhood Hotel with commercial space on the ground floor. The landmark building’s significant features are designated as all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as the interior entrance lobby of the main banking hall, including skylights, original check desks and counters, and historic lighting. On the exterior, the rehabilitation will clean, repair, and repaint the historic bronze windows on the first and second floors. Non-historic windows on the third through sixth floors will be repaired and replaced if they are beyond repair. A new entrance canopy along W. Madison St will be added for the hotel entrance and exterior uplighting will be installed on the building’s facade. A mural is proposed for a portion of the common brick on the west elevation, with historic preservation staff recommending the use of vapor permeable paint or attaching mural panels onto the masonry to prevent damage to the brick facade. On the interior, the rehab will retain historic features of the banking hall. The hotel’s main entrance will be at the northwest end of the building’s W. Madison St frontage, with the main entry to ground floor space at the northeast corner. A new passenger and service elevator will be added. A glass partition between interior columns will enclose the monumental stair for the hotel space to separate it from the rest of the ground floor banking hall space.  The elevator lobby and main corridors of the upper floors will be retained, and the existing door locations will be used for the hotel rooms wherever possible. The historic skylight will be modified and renovated to add a new daylighting system over the exterior skylight structure and a new translucent acoustical panel system will be added on the interior that will have the appearance of glazing.  With the permit issued, general contractor Bulley & Andrews can begin the interior renovation work to convert the building into hotel rooms. The hotel is expected to open sometime in 2025. ",West Loop

Plan Commission will review revised development at 1016 W. Jackson,"The Chicago Plan Commission will later this month review Mavrek Development’s revised proposal for a mixed-use development at 1016 W. Jackson. Located just west of the intersection of W. Jackson Blvd and S. Morgan St, the new version of the proposal includes the corner parcel next to the original site. The new development would replace an existing five-story office building, a two-story commercial structure, and a large parking lot.  Designed by Eckenhoff Saunders, the revised development cuts the tower’s height by three floors going from 28 floors to 25 stories, resulting in a 20-foot haircut to 275 feet down from 295 feet. An additional 10 residential units will result in 380 apartments with 76 affordable apartments. With a grocery store now part of the proposal, the retail square footage will increase from 6,500 square feet to 23,000 square feet. Parking has also increased from 125 to 163 parking stalls.  The revised design for the project refines the original design language with a gridded metal facade volume intersecting a glass volume. The design uses a corten steel frame with a glass and aluminum glazing system. In this revised version, the glass volume wraps around to the north facade to lighten the massing of the building as seen from the north.

A total of 300 parking spaces will be split between the two buildings as well as 724 bike parking spaces. Rather than a large podium, the development has been designed as two rectangular point towers, with the eastern tower rising 33 floors at 349 feet tall and the western tower reaching 31 floors and 328 feet in height. The towers will have gridded facades made up of metal paneling and glazing. The parking floors will have a hybrid of architectural metal screening. On the ground floor, both residential lobbies will face east towards N. Elizabeth St with small retail spaces at each southeastern corner. An access drive will stretch across the north side of the site for loading and parking access including a dropoff zone.  Designed by Confluence, the site will be designed to feature a flexible turf lawn between the buildings and a dog run along N. Ogden Ave. A pedestrian path will run across the southern portion of the site, featuring seating, bike racks, and a sculpture terrace. The demolition permits issued will allow for the clearing of a one-story masonry commercial building at 400 N. Elizabeth and a two-story masonry commercial building at 401 N. Ogden.

City Council approves Class L for 801 W. Madison,"The Chicago City Council has approved a Class L tax incentive for the adaptive reuse of the former Mid-City Trust & Savings Bank Building. Located at 801 W. Madison, the building occupies the southwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Halsted St. Purchased in 2022, Experiential Capital Group is leading the redevelopment of the building. With Pappageorge Haymes Partners serving as the architect, the project will rehabilitate the exterior and convert the interior into a hotel operated by The Neighborhood Hotel with commercial space on the ground floor. The landmark building’s significant features are designated as all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as the interior entrance lobby of the main banking hall, including skylights, original check desks and counters, and historic lighting. On the exterior, the rehabilitation will clean, repair, and repaint the historic bronze windows on the first and second floors. Non-historic windows on the third through sixth floors will be repaired and replaced if they are beyond repair. A new entrance canopy along W. Madison St will be added for the hotel entrance and exterior uplighting will be installed on the building’s facade. A mural is proposed for a portion of the common brick on the west elevation, with historic preservation staff recommending the use of vapor permeable paint or attaching mural panels onto the masonry to prevent damage to the brick facade. On the interior, the rehab will retain historic features of the banking hall. The hotel’s main entrance will be at the northwest end of the building’s W. Madison St frontage, with the main entry to ground floor space at the northeast corner. A new passenger and service elevator will be added. A glass partition between interior columns will enclose the monumental stair for the hotel space to separate it from the rest of the ground floor banking hall space.  The elevator lobby and main corridors of the upper floors will be retained, and the existing door locations will be used for the hotel rooms wherever possible. The historic skylight will be modified and renovated to add a new daylighting system over the exterior skylight structure and a new translucent acoustical panel system will be added on the interior that will have the appearance of glazing.  Set to cost $53 million, the building’s current property taxes are approximately $770,000. With rehabilitation and no Class L, the taxes would increase up to $15.4 million. With the Class L incentive, the taxes will be reduced to $7.2 million, representing an approximately $8.2 million tax abatement over the 12-year period. With approval from the City Council secured, the Class L tax incentive will go into effect and contribute to the financial arrangements for the project. The hotel is expected to open in 2025.

ZBA approves variance for 3310 N. Lincoln,"The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a variation for the mixed-use development at 3310 N. Lincoln. Located just north of the intersection of N. Lincoln Ave and W. School St, the project’s site is an irregularly shaped lot fronting the angled street. Planned by Mangan Builders, the former Rexx Rugs buildings will be demolished to clear the way for the new construction. With a design from Johnathan Splitt Architects, the new construction will encompass a six-story mixed-use building. Rising 83 feet, the project will front N. Lincoln Ave with approximately 1,500 square feet of retail space while holding 24 units on the upper floors. Split into 4 studios, 19 two-beds, and one three-bedroom unit, approximate rents will start at $1,050/month for studios, $1,480/month for two-beds, and $1,920/month for the three-bedroom unit. Five of the apartments will be designated as affordable units. The building will provide 7 car parking spaces and 24 bike parking spaces in an enclosed garage on the back of the ground floor accessed from the alley. With approval from the ZBA, the project will get a variation to reduce the rear setback on floors containing dwelling units from 30 feet to 7.21 feet. With the rezoning approved in 2022 and the variation now approved from the ZBA, the developers can move forward with the approximately $7 million development. Permits for the project have been filed, but a timeline for construction is currently unclear. ",Lakeview
Site plan approval secured for first building at Riverline,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has granted site plan approval for the first building to be constructed at Riverline. Developed by CMK Companies, the project will be located at 1010 S. Wells along the South Branch of the Chicago River. With Gensler behind the updated design, the 21-story tower will stand 227 feet tall. As part of the redesign, the building has shifted from 286 condos to 386 apartments. The building’s parking count has been reduced from 240 spaces to 182 parking spaces. The building will include 2,904 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.  As part of the redesign, the liner units on the podium have been substituted for building amenities and parking areas. The ground floor facades are proposed to remain with extensive full-height prefinished aluminum glass window system while the parking above ground level will be screened with multi-colored, perforated metal panels. The bulk of the residential tower will be clad in glass and aluminum window wall with a corrugated metal paneling cladding the mechanical penthouse at the top of the building.  The proposal will have its retail, residential, and vehicular access all off of S. Wells St as previously approved. The retail and parking entries have been pulled back to emphasize a tall, fully glazed residential lobby and to define an entry plaza at Wells and Taylor Street. The site will include a section of public riverwalk along the banks of the Chicago River and will be accessed via two access paths that run along the north and south sides of the building through open landscaped areas. A dog run will be included for residents. With site plan approval secured, the developer can move forward with permitting and construction on the project. While permits have been filed and are undergoing review, a timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",South Loop
Lendlease achieves stabilization at The Reed at Southbank,"Lendlease recently announced the stabilization of the apartments at The Reed at Southbank, the firm’s 41-story residential tower at 234 W. Polk St. in Chicago’s South Loop neighborhood. The rental units are now 95% occupied since the property welcomed its first residents last summer. Located along the Chicago River immediately south of the Loop, The Reed is the second high-rise completed in the 7-acre Southbank master plan. The property includes 226 apartments in a mix of studio, convertible, one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans, in addition to 214 condominiums on the upper floors. This hybrid model provides flexible living options and allows for a wider range of shared amenities for all residents. “Renters have gravitated to The Reed’s exceptional amenities, industrial-modern design and unparalleled location along the riverfront, steps from the heart of downtown,” said Andrew Trickett, Managing Director, Investment Management, Lendlease. “These characteristics not only help create an incomparable living experience for our residents, but they are also the foundation for creating valuable assets to support our investment management strategy.” Designed by Perkins&WIll, apartments at The Reed feature 9-foot exposed concrete ceilings, wide-plank wood flooring and full-height windows showcasing views of the downtown skyline, adjacent Southbank Park and Chicago River. Select units also include balconies. The tower’s eighth-floor amenity suite includes a 15,000-square-foot outdoor deck with a resort-style pool and cabanas, sunning lawn, fire pits, fully equipped kitchens and adjacent dining areas. Additional amenities include a wet lounge adjacent to the pool deck; indoor-outdoor fitness center with dedicated HIIT and yoga spaces; show kitchen and dining room; lounge room with TVs, a pool table and seating areas that can double as workspaces; virtual sports simulation room; salon; massage room; and media room. The hospitality-inspired lobby features a fireplace, bar, 24-hour concierge, mail and package rooms, bike storage and seating for remote work and small social gatherings. The Reed is immediately adjacent to Southbank Park, a 2-acre green space privately developed by Lendlease as a public amenity. The park features a central lawn, natural stone amphitheater and meandering walkways that connect to a new riverwalk, designed as an extension of the Chicago Riverwalk. Demonstrating Lendlease’s longstanding commitments to sustainability and wellness, The Reed holds LEED Gold, Fitwel and ENERGY STAR certifications. Green initiatives at the property include the use of a lower-carbon concrete mix during construction that substituted approximately 60% of the Portland cement with ash and slag; EV charging stations in the building’s private parking garage; an EV car-sharing program; and a partnership with The Roof Crop, which maintains rooftop gardens and apiaries from which flowers, produce and honey are harvested and shared with residents and local businesses.

City Council approves mixed-use development at 2328 S. Michigan,"The Chicago City Council has approved a mixed-use development located at 2328 S. Michigan. Planned by Fern Hill, the project site is located midblock between E. 23rd St and E. 24th St. The property previously held a Burger King that is surrounded by a vacant surface parking lot. Designed by Eckenhoff Saunders, the design splits the development into two massings on the front and back of the site. Along the street, the seven-story massing has been broken down, splitting the 175-foot-long frontage into three parts that are complementary in width and scale to surrounding buildings as part of the historic Motor Row District. The facades are clad in materials similar in tone to the district but not matching, including terracotta toned masonry, white glazed brick, and tan toned brick. On the back portion of the site, an 18-story midrise will rise approximately 170 feet tall. The volume was setback from the street to avoid being visible from within the historic district. The tower was designed to be neutral with an aluminum curtain wall, metal slab edge covers, and glass spandrel panels. The development will have 256 residential units with a unit mix of 88 studios, 136 one-beds, 32 two-beds. The project has 64 affordable units accounting for 25% of the units. The development is one of the first projects to take advantage of the floor area bonus under the Connected Communities ordinance where developers can swap parking spaces for affordable housing. The affordable units will be split into 22 studios, 34 one-beds, and 8 two-beds.  On the ground floor, the project fronts S. Michigan Ave with 3,000 square feet of retail space with the residential entry at the south end of the building’s frontage. 16 residential units will face an internal courtyard that separates the two massings. Ten parking spaces will be located along the alley with two loading spaces. 256 bike parking spaces will be provided in a bike room between the residential lobby and loading dock.  With City Council approval secured, the site will be rezoned from DS-5 to DX-5 with a Planned Development designation. The project will pay $1.66 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to receive a 3.1 FAR bonus and a 0.31 FAR bonus will be taken from the parking swap. With the project approved, the developers will turn their attention to securing financing for the $110 million development.

1000M celebrates grand opening,"Developers Time Equities, JK Equities, and Oak Capitals recently celebrated the grand opening of 1000M. Located at 1000 S. Michigan in downtown Chicago’s Historic Michigan Boulevard District across from Grant Park, the 73-story tower was designed by the late, legendary architect Helmut Jahn to embrace famed views of the park and of Chicago’s world-renowned skyline along Lake Michigan. “More than 10 years ago, Helmut Jahn and I began discussing our vision for an innovative, iconic residential tower here at 1000 S. Michigan Ave.,” said Francis Greenburger, Chairman and CEO of Time Equities. “Needless to say, we are thrilled with the result – it was certainly a labor of love. We could not have done this without the tireless commitment from the development team, Jahn, Kara Mann Design, Willow Bridge Properties and McHugh Construction.” With vistas top of mind, Jahn’s elegant glass-and-steel exterior for 1000M, as well as the building’s orientation, provides the opportunity for residents to look upon Chicago’s best natural assets – its lakefront and parks – and its architectural diversity. “The concept for 1000M is based on using the functions within to create a bold architectural statement on the skyline, while being responsive to contextual influences,” said Philip Castillo, FAIA, managing director of Jahn. “The curving façade and building height optimize views of the city, park, and Museum Campus. The footprint for the residential floors cantilevers to the south to capture breathtaking lake and city vistas. 1000M really is designed to celebrate Chicago’s distinct beauty and contribute to the city’s architectural legacy.” 1000M features 738 apartments with gracious floorplans, abundant natural light and extraordinary views. Current monthly rents start at $2,080 for studios; $2,400 for convertibles; $3,100 for one-bedrooms; $5,100 for two-bedrooms; $9,500 for three-bedrooms; and $16,000 for four-bedroom penthouses. Each home boasts 9-foot ceilings, oversized windows, premium plank flooring and light-filtering roller shades. Kitchens include custom soft-close wood cabinetry, under cabinet lighting, Caesarstone countertops, and built-in paneled refrigerators and dishwashers. Bathrooms include Calcutta Gold and Marquina porcelain tile, mirrors with integrated lighting and high-design glass shower doors. The building boasts 80,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities that span seven floors and feature spectacular views. On levels 3 and 4, a 10,000-plus square-foot health club offers state-of-the-art cardio, strength, circuit and H.I.I.T. training equipment; a basketball half-court; spin studio; personal training rooms; yoga rooms; massage/treatment rooms and more. An indoor lap pool and whirlpool are on level 8. Across levels 8 and 20 are a mix of sophisticated, comfortable, entertainment-ready social lounges, many with outdoor terrace access. They include gathering areas for relaxing and dining, fireplaces, libraries, a baby grand piano, wet bars, and easy access to chef’s demonstration or catering kitchens, but each lounge has a distinct identity. The Cocktail Lounge, for example, recalls Chicago’s famous speakeasies, while the Billiards Lounge and Arcade, Children’s Art and Playroom, and the Game Room offer entertainment such as foosball, shuffleboard and air hockey for adults or children. A golf simulator is housed in its own space. Also on level 8 is an expansive outdoor sundeck with loungers, cabanas, a social garden, al fresco dining, grilling stations, and a heated pool for three-season use. On level 10, an Art Gallery leads to a Zen Garden overlooking the pool, with lounge seating, firepits, dining areas and grilling stations. Coworking on level 21 offers communal and independent workspaces, coffee bars and print stations, private offices and booths, collaboration pods, and video-enabled conference rooms. The double-height lounge on level 73, scheduled to be completed in early fall, will showcase the tower’s signature amenity space: an open-air terrace with unparalleled lake, park and skyline views from what will be the highest residential observation deck in the city. Behind the open-air terrace will be the Wintergarden, a large social space flooded year-round with natural light. A reservable dining room with demonstration kitchen and jaw-dropping vistas will provide tenants with an intimate special occasion venue. With McHugh Construction serving as the general contractor, the $435 million tower first welcomed residents on May 1st and is already one-third leased. ",South Loop

Lendlease receives site plan approval for next phase of Southbank,"Australian developer Lendlease has received site plan approval for its next tower at the larger Southbank development. Planned at 680 S. Wells, the developer is acquiring a narrow parcel between the original Southbank property and the Alta Grand Central residential towers to its northeast. That parcel will be incorporated into the new design and masterplan for the project. Designed by FitzGerald, the 40-story residential tower will rise 430 feet and overlook Southbank Park and the Chicago River. On the ground floor, the residential entry will be accessed at the northeast corner of the building along S. Wells St, with the retail entrance on the southeast corner. A private drive will occupy the newly added parcel and include a drop-off zone in front of the residential entry as well as access to the loading dock and parking access on the west side of the building. Above the ground floor, the podium will hold a number of parking floors to accommodate the planned 239 car parking spaces. 120 bike parking spaces are also included. Above the podium, the residential portion of the tower will rise above, accommodating 531 residential units featuring balconies and an alternating metal panel facade design. With the site plan approval secured, the project can continue moving forward. A permit for the new construction has been filed and is currently under review. The project’s situation is complicated by the fact that Lendlease recently announced that they will be pulling out of development projects outside of their home country of Australia, putting Southbank and other projects up for sale. A timeline for the acquisition of the project and then future construction is completely up in the air.  ",South Loop

Bears release plans for $4.7B stadium project in Chicago,"The Chicago Bears yesterday unveiled their plans to build a new domed stadium along the lakefront at a price of $4.7 billion. Planned to be located just south of Soldier Field, the enclosed stadium allows for more events while the larger site overall would be reconfigured to include 14 acres of athletic fields and recreational park space for use by public and youth sports programs. The athletic fields would provide a high-quality, safe place for the city's youth, especially those from nearby underserved neighborhoods, to gather and play sports. Visitors would be able to enjoy the lakefront via indoor and outdoor experiences. The plan features a three-acre promenade and plaza area which could include year-round food and beverage outlets, retail shops, a cultural attraction focused on sports and Soldier Field history.  A publicly-owned hotel could also be included on the recreation and cultural campus. Designed by Manica Architecture, the proposal includes a contemporary architectural design which complements the existing architecture featuring an enclosed, fixed roof with spectacular views of Chicago's skyline and lakefront as well as intimate seating for unparalleled sight lines and open spaces for congregating. The stadium would be capable of hosting large-scale sporting events year-round, including Super Bowls and NCAA Final Fours as well as the world's most prominent entertainment acts. Those spectacles would unlock economic benefits for a variety of sectors within Chicago and the region. Other project features include a pedestrian mall and pavilion, a wider variety of food and beverage options, more public restrooms, and the preservation of Soldier Field's historic colonnades, which will remain accessible to fans and continue to honor the men and women who served in our nation's military. The plan also involves the easing of traffic circulation in the area by creating improved ramps and interchanges at 18th Street, by building a new parking deck built on an existing surface lot, creating improved access to DuSable Lake Shore Drive via a new overpass, relocation of a Lake Shore Drive exit and new ramps to the campus, and a new lower level for McFetridge Drive. The changes are expected to result in a 50% increase in campus capacity for events, a 10- to 20-minute reduction in event exit times, and 1,200 vehicle hours of congestion removed on an average day at the intersection of DuSable Lake Shore Drive and McFetridge Drive.  The Bears have pledged to contribute more than $2 billion to the project—over 70% of the total stadium cost. The remaining stadium funds are proposed to come from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA), a government entity that was created by the Illinois General Assembly in 1987 for the purpose of constructing and renovating sports stadiums for professional teams in the state of Illinois. The Bears' proposal can be accomplished with the existing 2% hotel tax used to back ISFA bonds. Set to cost approximately $1.5 billion, the infrastructure plan for the project is split into three phases. Phase 1 consists of requirements to open the stadium including transportation, roadways and utilities, and would cost an estimated $325 million. Phase 2 would maximize the stadium and surrounding campus, cost $510 million and include a bus depot expansion, new parks and playfields. Phase 3 would further enhance the campus, cost $665 million and consist of additional transportation improvements, retail and public attractions. While there will be a long road ahead of review and approvals, The Bears are aiming to break ground in the summer of 2025, with a planned grand opening in the summer of 2028. ",South Loop

Clark Construction is serving as the general contractor for the construction. “The US real estate market is a very important piece of QIP’s real estate growth strategy,” commented Peter Young, CEO of QIP. “As QIP develops its multifamily housing investment development & operational capability and establishes its position as a leading player in the private equity real estate investment sector, this partnership with MAC offers an opportunity to further build out our global residential living sector platform across the US, the UK, and Japan.” ",South Loop
Related Midwest releases further renderings of White Sox stadium at The 78,"Developer Related Midwest has shared further renderings of the potential new White Sox stadium at The 78 site. Urbanize recently shared a first look at renderings of the potential stadium as Related Midwest engages in negotiations with the White Sox about the possibility of them building a new stadium on the 62-acre South Loop property. The additional new conceptual renderings show the proposed stadium structure anchoring the high-rise district. With home plate at the southwest corner, the stadium wraps around the field primarily on the west and south sides, offering expansive views of downtown beyond including the Sears Tower. A new public plaza will be located to the north of the stadium, with a large video screen facing the terraced park.  The renderings show the Wells-Wentworth Connector reconfigured to bend around the stadium, with a new public plaza along the Chicago River. A newly configured series of towers rise around the stadium, likely a mix of office and residential uses. The Discovery Partners Institute will be integrated into the new configuration at the south end of the site. Earlier in 2023, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the White Sox, was considering a move from Guaranteed Rate Field as their lease ends after the 2029 season. Further reporting since our last article indicates that Related Midwest and the White Sox have had meetings with Mayor Johnson and state representatives regarding the future of this proposal and potential public funding. Alderman Pat Dowell, whose ward includes The 78, has put out a statement indicating a positive outlook on the project but withholding final judgment until more details come to light.  As the White Sox look to move closer to downtown, the future of Guaranteed Rate Field and the sea of parking lots around it are in question. While they do not own the land at 35th & Shields, Related Midwest has a long history of working in communities and has put together conceptual ideas for the property. Any redevelopment of the area would be subject to a robust community process to determine the best use for the land.   ",South Loop

Feedback from our early VIPs has been extremely positive.” Designed by the late Helmut Jahn, the 805-foot-tall tower features a highly sculpted form with an angled, cantilevered base topped by glass-clad residential floors that widen as the building rises. With 738 apartment units, residences will range from studios to three-bedroom penthouse units. 325 car parking spaces and 356 bike parking spaces will be included in a large parking garage at the back of the building. The first residents are scheduled to move in on May 1, 2024, with additional deliveries phasing in throughout the balance of 2024. Monthly rents currently start at $2,075 for studios, $3,115 for one-bedrooms, $5,865 for two-bedrooms, $8,770 for three-bedrooms and $14,470 for four-bedrooms.  With the interiors designed by Kara Mann, all residences feature the same Kara Mann-appointed luxury furnishings no matter the apartment or floor. 1000M features the largest amenity package in the city, with 80,000 square feet of luxe community spaces spanning eight levels, including the highest residential observation deck in the city located on level 73. Residents can enjoy lively social spaces and relaxing lounges. Both an indoor lap pool and a heated 3-season pool and deck allow for year-round swimming. Two floors of high-end fitness and wellness facilities rival many gyms, and an entire 10,000 sq ft floor of dedicated co-working facilities. 1000M has opened a pre-leasing center at 1006 S. Michigan and prospective residents can book showroom tours to see the complete details and offerings of the building. Leasing and management is being handled by Willow Bridge Property Company, with a dedicated website for the property at 1000MChicago.com. ",South Loop
Renderings emerge for potential White Sox stadium at The 78,"Renderings have surfaced for a potential new White Sox stadium at The 78 site. Recent reports have brought to light the fact that the White Sox are negotiating with developer Related Midwest about the possibility of building a new stadium on the 62-acre South Loop property. Originally approved as a multi-tower, mixed-use megadevelopment in 2020, the new conceptual renderings show the proposed stadium structure anchoring the high-rise district. With home plate at the southwest corner, the stadium wraps around the field primarily on the west and south sides, with a large video screen overlooking a large plaza to the north.  The renderings show the Wells-Wentworth Connector reconfigured to bend around the stadium, with a new public plaza along the Chicago River. A newly configured series of towers rise around the stadium, likely a mix of office and residential uses. The Discovery Partners Institute building can be seen in the largest scale overall rendering at the south end of the site. Earlier in 2023, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the White Sox, was considering a move from Guaranteed Rate Field as their lease ends after the 2029 season. While the future of the team’s home is unclear, the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which owns and financed Guaranteed Rate Field, has reportedly not been involved in the discussions. The megadevelopment by Related Midwest has stalled with nothing moving forward on the site as of yet. The Discovery Partners Institute would be the first tenant of the large parcel, with their building set to break ground this year. As the developer continues its search for funding and users, landing the White Sox would be a shot in the arm for moving the development forward. Efforts to develop the city’s first casino on the property fell through when former Mayor Lightfoot chose Bally’s proposal at the former Tribune site. ",South Loop
Full building permit issued at 1730 S. Wabash,"A full building permit has been issued for a mixed-use development at 1730 S. Wabash. Planned by CMK Companies, the project site is located at the northwest corner of S. Wabash Ave and E. 18th St. The property is currently a surface parking lot. With Pappageorge Haymes Partners serving as the architect, permit filings indicate the development will be 12 stories tall with 110 residential units. The ground floor will have commercial space and the building will provide 80 parking spaces on the first and second floors. With the site zoned DX-5, the mixed-use development is proceeding as-of right, avoiding a review by City Hall and associated committees including the Chicago Plan Commission and Committee on Zoning. Renderings or drawings have not been made public at the time of writing. Developer CMK Companies is keeping busy in the area, with permits issued or in the works for developments at 1630 S. Wabash, 1700 S. Wabash, and 1723 S. Michigan. With the piles and foundation permits already issued, this permit issuance will allow general contractor Brandts Build, LLC to work on the building through completion.

CTA awards Red Line Extension construction contract,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has taken the next major step in the Red Line Extension (RLE) project by selecting contracting team Walsh-VINCI Transit Community Partners to design and build the 5.6-mile extension of the Red Line from 95th Street to 130th Street, including four new Red Line stations. The Chicago Transit Board has approved the award of a $2.9 billion contract to Walsh-VINCI Transit Community Partners following a comprehensive, two-year procurement process. The RLE is a transit equity project that fulfills a commitment to the Far South Side by significantly improving transportation to this part of the city with 5.6 miles of new track and four new fully accessible rail stations at 103rd, 111th, Michigan near 116th and 130th Street. The project’s budget has increased to $5.3 billion, which includes financing expenses, to cover cost increases for construction materials, labor and financing. The prior project budget was $3.6 billion before finance charges and $4.1 billion including financing costs. CTA is moving forward with the project to fulfill the long-ago promise to the Far South Side that the RLE would be built. Delaying the project would potentially increase the budget by several billions of dollars.  “The Red Line Extension corrects past transit inequity and increases access to the most affordable transportation in the city. Hiring the contracting team that can provide the best value to the CTA to construct the RLE is a consequential step that demonstrates our vow to build this project,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The CTA’s Red Line Extension Project is an example of how transportation dollars can be distributed to have lasting impact on the Far South Side including workforce and small business opportunities that create jobs and support families.” The contracting team will be responsible for building the Mainline project, which includes the extension of the Red Line 5.6 miles from the 95th Street to south of 130th Street as well as building the four new, accessible stations near 103rd Street, 111th Street, Michigan Avenue and 130th Street, each expected to include bus, bike, pedestrian and parking facilities. Walsh-VINCI Transit Community Partners includes Walsh Construction, VINCI Construction, EXP, Systra, and other subcontractors. Construction is expected to start in late 2025 and be completed by 2030.  The CTA is beginning advance construction work this fall, including demolition of properties acquired for the project and advance utility relocation, which includes removing wires and poles and relocating utility equipment ahead of major construction in late 2025.

Final design for Redefine the Drive proposes lakefront highway with no transit priority,"IDOT and CDOT recently hosted an open house to share their final preferred alternative for the redesign of North DuSable Lake Shore Drive. The North DuSable Lake Shore Drive Phase 1 Study is looking to improve the corridor by improving safety and mobility, addressing infrastructure deficiencies, and improving access and circulation. According to the agencies, the 7-mile corridor from Grand Ave to Hollywood Ave has as many as 170,000 vehicles per day  After a years-long process, alternatives that would’ve included light rail transit, tunnels or causeways, or a local street with dedicated bus lanes were all ruled out. According to information shared, light rail was dismissed because the alignment along the lakeshore would require passengers to board or transfer to/from E-W bus routes at or beyond the urban edge and wouldn’t be able to directly serve destinations inland from NDLSD. No clear transit mobility improvements would be created compared to existing or improved NDLSD express bus services and would require specialized vehicles, maintenance shop and storage yard according to the agencies. According to materials from the agencies, the selected alternative, dubbed ‘The Essential’, would significantly improve access and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists; would reduce transit delays by 7 minutes while improving reliability, rider comfort, and lakefront access; improves automotive safety and operations while minimizing cut through traffic; and reduces the footprint in Lincoln Park with no additional miles of ramos and lanes. As IDOT and CDOT finalize the study, they will have community-focused design discussions with community members through 2024 and into 2025 with a final public hearing in 2025 before they complete the study in 2025 to become eligible for federal funding. A timeline for securing funding and initiating Phase 2 detailed design is undetermined. See the full set of before and afters below: ",Citywide

Residential development proposed at 1055 W. Diversey,"Developer Contemporary Concepts Inc has presented plans for their proposed development at 1055 W. Diversey to the local community. Planned at the southeast corner of W. Diversey Pkwy and N. Seminary Ave, the project site is currently occupied by a former church building whose congregation is moving to a different location.  Designed by Studio Dwell Architects, the new development would stand five stories tall with 24 residential units. The residential units will be split into one one-bed, nine two-beds, 13 three-beds, and one four-bedroom unit. While four units will be set aside as affordable, the market rate units will be priced at $3000/month for two-beds, $4,000-$4,200/month for three-beds, and $5,500/month for the four-bedroom unit. Rising approximately 58 feet tall, the five-story building will be clad in brick with metal accent panels and a sawtooth brick pattern accent on the ground floor. The windows on the ground floor will feature limestone surrounds.  The building’s residential entry will front N. Seminary Ave, with five residential units and a bike room for 7 bikes on the ground floor. A single accessible parking space will be accessible from the alley. Two of the ground floor residential units will have private terraces. Community members had mixed reactions. One neighbor asked if the developer considered building a larger building, but they felt this size was a sweet spot for buildability and fitting into the neighborhood context. Another neighbor asked for more green initiatives in the building and another neighbor asked for more bike parking. While feedback was mostly positive, one neighbor raised concerns about the lack of parking, but Alderman Knudsen explained how residents in this TOD building would be ineligible for neighborhood permit parking to mitigate impacts on neighbors. To allow for the development to move forward, the developer is seeking a rezoning from RT-4 to B2-3 as well as a set of zoning variations. If they receive support from the alderman, the development team would seek to introduce the zoning application in April, go before the Committee on Zoning and City Council in May and then start the permitting process. The construction period would last approximately a year and they hope to finish in Summer 2025. ",Citywide

City Council approves adaptive reuse of 208 S. LaSalle,"The Chicago City Council has approved a rezoning for The LaSalle Residences, an office-to-residential adaptive reuse project at 208 S. LaSalle. Planned by The Prime Group, the 21-story building was Burnham’s last design before he died, built in 1914 for the Continental and Commercial National Bank. The Prime Group has already converted the lower 12 floors into a JW Marriott Hotel and opened floors 18-22 as The LaSalle Hotel with 232 keys in 2022.  Completed in 1914, the historic 1.2 million-square-foot, 22-story building at 208 S. LaSalle St. was initially designed by world-famous Chicago architect D.H. Burnham & Co. in the Classical Revival style for the Continental and Commercial National Bank. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007. As part of the plan, roughly 222,500 square feet of office space on floors 13 to 16 will be repurposed into 226 apartments offered in studio, one- and two-bedroom floor plans. The LaSalle Residences will feature a new ground-floor lobby as well as residential amenities, including a state-of-the-art fitness facility; club-inspired tenant lounge spaces supporting coworking, meetings and social events; and penthouse-level community terraces with an outdoor pool and gathering areas overlooking the historic structure’s central atrium and offering panoramic views of the Loop’s iconic skyline. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative and Lucien Lagrange, the conversion will also upgrade all older mechanical systems with modern energy-efficient equipment and replace the existing single-pane windows with high-performance insulated glass. The mixed-income project will set aside 30% of the residences as affordable housing for qualifying individuals and families earning an average of 60% of the area mean income (AMI). The transit-oriented location is in the heart of Chicago’s central business district adjacent to the historic CTA Quincy station and within walking distance of other CTA stops, Metra commuter rail stations and Chicago Water Taxi service. With City Council approval secured, the property’s Planned Development designation will be removed, and the site will be reverted to its underlying zoning of DC-16 to allow for the residential conversion. The developer expects to begin construction on the $130 million redevelopment in early 2025.  ",The Loop
CDC approves $98 million in TIF for 135 S. LaSalle,"The Community Development Commission has approved $98 million in TIF funding for the residential conversion of The Field Building at 135 S. LaSalle. Originally proposed by Riverside Investment and Development and AmTrustRE, local developer DL3 Realty has been added to the development team.  135 S. LaSalle, known as the Field building, is a 44-story Art-Deco style building that was designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst, and White and was completed in 1934 and designated as a Chicago Landmark in 1994. The 1.35 million square foot building has large floor plates and has over 1.125 million square feet of vacancy (83%) mostly due to Bank of America’s headquarters relocating to 110 N. Wacker. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the new scope of the adaptive reuse will convert 624,000 square feet of space in the building into 386 residential units and 92,000 square feet of commercial space. On lower level one, the ground level, and level two, the project will feature 92,000 square feet dedicated to commercial space which is intended to include neighborhood amenities such as a small format grocer, health/fitness center, medical office, and complementary uses. Levels three and four will be converted into an approximate 100,000 square feet parking garage with 177 parking spaces. Located on Floors 5-14, the residential component of the project consists of 430,050 square feet. The floors will be converted into 386 residential units, of which 116 (30%) will be affordable to households with an average income of under 60% of the AMI. The unit mix is expected to include 228 studios, 106 one-beds, 52 two-beds, with the project listing a per-unit development cost of $500,140. The residential units will also have access to both indoor and outdoor amenity space on floors five, 25, 43, and 44.   The $241.5 million development will be funded by an $86 million private loan, $19.8 million in general partner equity, $98 million in TIF funding, $32.1 million in Historic Tax Credit Equity, and a $5.5 million deferred developer fee. With Community Development Commission approval, the proposed TIF funding will head to City Hall to get final approvals and sign off from the City Council. Construction could begin as soon as July with completion projected for April 2027. ",The Loop
Google reveals renderings of Thompson Center atrium,"Google has released new renderings of its redevelopment of the Thompson Center, shedding light on their plans for the iconic atrium space in the building. Located at 100 W. Randolph, the redevelopment is being led by Prime | Capri Interests, made up of The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group, for Google. The newly released renderings show the multi-level atrium reimagined with forum seating connecting the levels and enlivened with greenery. A collection of small retail and restaurant spaces are supported by various seating areas within the space. Artwork adorns some of the walls and the floor in the center of the bottom level. An additional rendering shows the view of the building’s atrium from the plaza, where a second-floor balcony and communal space is visible. Another rendering shows the office entrance from N. LaSalle St which features a double-height lobby and exterior canopy overhanging the entrance to the building.  With Jahn/ returning to lead the reimagining of the building, the high-tech renovation will honor the signature design with strategic design improvements that enhance the building as a community destination. New elements include a heightened entry colonnade redesigned to allow a renewed ground floor experience, three levels of covered terraces with more natural light, access to green spaces and biophilic design elements.  The renovation of the Thompson Center will make it an all-electric building designed to meet LEED Platinum sustainability targets. The building’s facade and internal systems will be replaced, and a new triple-pane glass exterior will improve the facility’s thermal performance. Additionally, the Thompson Center’s previous heating and cooling systems will be replaced with high-efficiency equipment that can manage Chicago’s seasonal weather.  Work on the building began back in April where general contractor Clark Construction has been removing the iconic facade. Google is slated to move into the building once construction wraps up in 2026. ",The Loop
City Council approves TIF funding for 79 W. Monroe,"The Chicago City Council has approved $28 million in TIF funding for the residential conversion planned at 79 W. Monroe. Planned by R2 Companies and the Campari Group, the Rector Building is a 14-story Beaux Arts-style masonry office building constructed in 1905 with a large, seamless south addition completed in 1924. The building occupies the full site at the southeast corner of W. Monroe St and S. Clark St.  Designed by Ware Malcomb, the adaptive reuse and conversion will measure approximately 100,000 square feet within the building, including the basement and floors 7 through 14. The conversion will transform floors 7 to 13 into 117 residential units, 41 of which (35%) will be designated as affordable housing. The project’s unit mix will include 56 studios, 54 one-beds, 7 two-beds. Zero parking spaces will be included in the project. On the ground floor, the renovated lobby along W. Monroe St will feature a dedicated entrance for residents only, enhancing security and accessibility. Amenities provided for residents will include a tenant lounge, fitness center, outdoor areas, bike storage, and a dog run, all located in the basement and on floor 14. Floors 2 through 6 will undergo no changes; they will continue to house the Intrinsic School, a charter high school.  Preservation efforts will focus on retaining and repairing the building’s character-defining exterior masonry, including brick, stone, and terra-cotta elements. The non-historic windows on the second through seventh floors will be retained, while the historic wood windows on floors 8 through 13 will be repaired. Metal fire windows on secondary elevations will be replaced with new aluminum windows designed to match the existing profiles. Internally, the existing elevator lobbies and corridors on floors 7 through 13 will be preserved, with nearby office spaces reconfigured into apartment units.  The estimated total cost of the project is $64.2 million expected to be funded with $28.4 million in equity, $7.8 million in historic tax credit equity, and $28 million in TIF funding. With the funding approved, the developer can continue to move forward with the project. A joint venture of Leopardo Companies and GMA Construction Group is anticipated to begin construction in Q1 2025 and open the converted space to new residents in Q1 2026. ",The Loop

Preliminary landmark approved for 111 W. Monroe,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for the Harris Trust & Savings Bank. Located at 111 W. Monroe, the building consists of a traditional Classical Revival skyscraper built in 1911 and an East Tower addition from 1960 designed in the modern idiom. The subject site measures approximately one acre, and the buildings are constructed to the sidewalks along the southwest corner of the intersection of Clark and Monroe streets.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city heritage, the Harris Trust & Savings Bank exemplifies the boom in banking in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century that led to Chicago being a prominent American financial center. The bank and its founder established the idea of buying and selling bonds as a primary business for the bank and sold it to the public. The Harris Trust & Savings Bank was a large employer and held major assets in Chicago for the majority of the 20th century. By the 1970s, the bank had amassed over $4 billion in assets and employed approximately 3,500 people in the Chicago area. In 1984, when it was purchased by the Bank of Montreal, Harris Trust & Savings Bank was the third-largest bank in Chicago.  Also meeting Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture, the 1911 portion of the Harris Trust & Savings Bank is an excellent example of Classical Revival architecture as applied to a skyscraper, influenced by the prominent 1893 World’s Fair and the city’s innovative approach to taller buildings. It features a tripartite design, monumental engaged pink granite columns, and applied terra cotta ornament.  Designed by SOM, the East Tower from 1960 is an excellent example of mid-century International Style architecture, influenced by the popularity of modernist architects in the United States. It features a steel structure, glass and metal curtain wall, and an absence of applied ornament. Though the Harris Bank Building and East Tower were not designed in the same style, they are visually integrated at the exterior with aligned floor levels and use of columns. They are also fully integrated in the interior.   Meeting Criterion 5 as the work of important architects, the 1911 building was designed by prominent firm Shepley, Rutan, & Coolidge who were also the architects for other notable works in Chicago including the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Cultural Center. The 1960 building was designed by Chicago-based firm Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill, an internationally important firm known for their skyscraper designs. The firm designed other significant buildings in Chicago including the Willis Tower and 875 N Michigan Avenue. Walter A. Netsch was supervising designer for the East Tower. Netsch was a noted individual designer who spent his career at SOM, working on projects like the Inland Steel Building and the U.S. Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel for the firm.  The Harris Trust & Savings Bank and the East Tower also meet the separate Integrity Criterion. They are in their original location on Monroe Street, and though the setting has been further developed in the second half of the twentieth century, they remain located in the commercial, financial, and civic center of the city. Overall, the Harris Trust & Savings Bank and the East Tower retain their original materials at the exterior. Like many early 20th century commercial buildings in the Loop, the cornice of the 1911 building has been removed. However, the Harris Trust & Savings Bank retains integrity of design and is still clearly recognizable as a Classical Revival building with its monumental Ionic columns. The East Tower is still clearly recognizable as an International Style building with minimal ornament, rectilinearity, and emphasis on volume. As proposed, the designation would declare the significant features to be protected as all exterior elevations of the 1911 Harris Trust & Savings Bank and the 1960 East Tower as well as the pair of bas relief bronze lion sculptures on the front façade of the 1911 Harris Trust & Savings Bank. As part of the LaSalle Reimagined initiative, this building will be redeveloped by Prime/Capri Interest, LLC, made up of The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group. The project has already received approval from the CDC for a $40 million TIF payment to convert the historic structure into a mixed-use building, set to include 345 apartments, 226 hotel keys, and meeting/event space on the second floor. The roof level will be reactivated by reopening the original Monroe Club as an amenity for residents and hotel guests. The former mechanical penthouse will become a restaurant, with the outdoor deck including a pool.  ",The Loop
Medline triples office space at Merchandise Mart,"Medline and Vornado Realty Trust have announced an agreement to expand Medline’s presence at THE MART by 110,000 square feet, making it one of the largest tenants at Vornado’s iconic, 3.7-million-square-foot property in downtown Chicago. Medline will more than triple its offices in THE MART from 51,000 to 161,000 square feet as part of a single, contiguous space across the majority of the 12th floor, committing to a long term lease with Vornado which will run through 2036.

Internally, the existing elevator lobbies and corridors on floors 7 through 13 will be preserved, with nearby office spaces reconfigured into apartment units.  The Zoning Board of Appeals approved a variation to eliminate the one required loading berth for the development. Due to the footprint of the building occupying the entire site, the physical configuration of the property makes it infeasible to add a loading space. Future residents would use the alley for loading. With the variation approved, the developer can continue to move forward with the project and get closer to starting construction. A joint venture of Leopardo Companies and GMA Construction Group is anticipated to begin work in Q1 2025 and open the converted space to new residents in Q1 2026. ",The Loop

Century and Consumers Buildings will be saved from demolition,"The GSA has released their Final Environmental Impact Statement which indicates their decision to not demolish the Century and Consumers buildings and look for a “viable” reuse plan. After $52 million in federal funds were approved to demolish the towers, the GSA and federal judges cited security and safety reasons for the Dirksen Courthouse as reasoning to clear this corner of the Loop. Built in 1915-16, the Century Building at 202 S. State is a strong example of an early 20th century commercial style building which was essentially an early urban mall, with shops on multiple levels where customers would pass through and shop. Designed by Holabird & Roche, the tower is designed with the fundamentals of the Chicago School with technological advancements that allowed for taller buildings with more glass and windows. The tower’s overall slenderness, narrow mullions, and recessed spandrel panels gave a sense of verticality to the building that was accentuated with its white glazed terracotta cladding.  Built just a few years earlier, the Consumers Building was completed in 1913 by developer Jacob L. Kesner, with Mundie and Jensen as the architects. Located at 220 S. State, the tower was built as a professional office building with extensive retail space on the lower floors. Also built in the commercial style with the tradition of Chicago School, the building’s steel frame is expressed by a more solid grid-like pattern of narrow, vertical piers and horizontal spandrel bands. The building also retains its lavish interior lobby, with carrera marble on the walls and ceilings with classical revival detailing. A marble staircase sits in an alcove while the space is adorned with decorative bronze fixtures.  During the federal government’s review process, the city underwent a long process of investigating landmark status, beginning with an overview and resolution to proceed reviewing the buildings, then a hearing where they did not advance a designation, then the Commission on Chicago Landmarks approved the preliminary landmark recommendation, and then a final landmark recommendation was approved. The buildings never became official city landmarks.  While the GSA has changed course and will not demolish the buildings, they have made a long list of stipulations for what they determine a “viable” reuse to be. Any proposal must meet all these criteria. -- 1. The Federal government must retain ownership interests to achieve its security objectives, as determined by the government in its discretion.  2. Occupancy/Use: Properties shall not be used for short-term or long-term residential or lodging, places of worship, or medical treatment, services, or research. No use that requires access to outdoor areas is permitted.  3. Access to the roof is restricted to maintenance and repair activities. Personnel and materials that will be present in this area shall be subject to clearance and controls necessary to meet court security objectives.  4. Developer would have no access or use rights to Quincy Court.  5. Loading is prohibited in Quincy Court and otherwise restricted in a manner to achieve court security. Loading on State or Adams Streets would be subject to local ordinance requirements. 6. Occupants and users of the buildings shall have no sight lines into the Dirksen Courthouse, the Dirksen Courthouse ramp, or the Quincy Court properties owned by GSA.  7. No parking or vehicle access is permitted on or within the properties.  8. Developer is responsible for staffing, at their expense, security 24 hours a day with personnel approved by the Federal Protective Service or an entity to whom security services are delegated by Federal Protective Service.   9. Developer must obtain and maintain access control systems to prevent unauthorized access to any location within the structures. Each exterior entrance point must have an intrusion detection system and access control system installed, and Developer must provide federal law enforcement access to each system.  10. Developer must install and maintain interior and exterior security cameras and provide federal law enforcement officials with access and the ability to monitor the feeds in real time.  11. Developer must install exterior lighting necessary to achieve courthouse security objectives. 12. Perimeter Security: Developer must prevent unauthorized access to the properties that would result in an unapproved sight line.  13. Fire escapes, and any other structures that would allow access from the street, must be removed.  14. All construction documents and specifications for any renovation, rehabilitation, modification, or construction of any portion of the building (interior or exterior) will be subject to review and approval by federal law enforcement agencies.  15. No project may start without the advance approval of GSA. -- As the GSA pursues a “viable” adaptive reuse, they will issue a Request for Lease Proposals to seek a reuse that meets the security needs of the Dirksen Courthouse.

The 345 apartments will be spread across floors 13 through 20, with a large light well cut out of the center of the building to allow for natural light to reach the new apartments. At the middle of the building, two floors will be turned into a world-class spa and fitness center with an indoor pool, golf simulator, and fitness center.  The proposed unit mix would include 130 studios, 170 one-beds, and 45 two-beds. Of those, 40 studios, 50 one-beds, and five two-beds would be set aside as affordable ranging from 40-80% AMI.  Set to cost approximately $202.8 million, the residential conversion would be funded with $31.5 million in developer equity, $87.3 million in loans, $40 million in TIF funding, a $9 million deferred developer fee, and $35 million in tax credit equity.  With another milestone under their belt, the development team is moving forward with securing all the necessary approvals for the project.

The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007. “In addition to breathing new life into an under-utilized Chicago landmark, The LaSalle Residences will help bring back some of the 24/7 vibrancy to Chicago’s downtown financial district lost during and after the COVID pandemic,” said architect Alan Barker, principal and residential market leader at LJC. “The Loop is an amenity-rich area, but continued foot traffic is key to retaining and attracting retail business. Converting office space to 226 units at 208 LaSalle St. will not only enhance the built-in customer base for downtown retail and amenities, but it will also preserve a piece of Chicago’s architectural history.” The estimated total project cost is $130 million, and The Prime Group aims to start construction in early 2025, pending additional city approvals and permits.  ",The Loop
Lotte Hotels & Resorts opens L7 Hotel in Chicago,"Chicago-based McHugh Construction has completed the multimillion-dollar renovation of a 191-room, 14-story hotel at the corner of N. Wabash Ave and E. Wacker Pl in Chicago, which opened in June as L7 Chicago, South Korea-based Lotte Hotels & Resorts’ first L7-branded property in North America. McHugh also built out Perilla Korean American Steakhouse, the hotel’s anchor restaurant on the ground floor, as well as a new lobby. “We leaned into our extensive adaptive reuse experience to transform this 112-year-old building into Chicago’s first hotel dedicated to Korean culture and hospitality,” said Kathleen Arnold, McHugh project manager. “For instance, we maximized the project’s unusual crawlspaces and basement level to place ductwork and exhaust systems for the Korean BBQ grill tables used throughout the Perilla steakhouse.” In late August 2023, McHugh began demolition of the restaurant and lobby of the former Kimpton Hotel Monaco and erected temporary walls, so the hotel remained in operation throughout the renovation. Using a waterfall approach, McHugh started renovating the top floor in November 2023 and worked its way down one floor at a time. Hotel rooms, suites and corridors received new carpet, wall coverings, finishes and furniture; signature window seats in each room were reupholstered; and aqua-green tiles were installed on the wall alongside each guest room door. McHugh collaborated with interior designer New York-based AvroKO and project architect Chicago-based Grec Architects to create L7’s tranquil, calm atmosphere that is supported through a sage green and crème color palette. With an eye toward attracting millennials, the hotel’s lobby was designed with a relaxing living room vibe. McHugh achieved this aesthetic by replacing marble tiles with a wood floor laid in a block pattern and surrounding the lobby fireplace with aqua-green glazed tiles from floor to ceiling. Warm wood trim and acoustic tile were added to the walls of the lobby’s seating area, and forest green floor tiles cut in a radius design accent a seating area in the middle of the lobby. A reception desk made of carved wood complements the space. Opposite the lobby, the Perilla Korean American Steakhouse is filled with custom grill tables surrounded by banquette seating, a bar and a chef’s counter that offers a tasting menu. The steakhouse’s décor features a color scheme of plum, green and cream with acoustical panels to soften conversational noise levels. McHugh installed a black iron duct system connected to exhaust tubing at each grill table and added an air unit on the roof to pull in fresh outside air. Since the building is surrounded by high-rises, McHugh facilitated installation of the 25,000-pound air unit on the roof via helicopter. “Like many cities where we work, Chicago’s hospitality business is making a strong comeback. It’s this perfect blend of lifestyle and experiential travel, business travel, and recreational and political events that are all happening right now and have shined a spotlight on our growing hospitality division,” said Kate Ivanova, McHugh’s executive vice president who oversees McHugh’s robust hospitality portfolio of over 100 completed projects, including new construction and renovations for Four Seasons Hotel Chicago, Ritz-Carlton and Peninsula Chicago. “Of course, our experience and reputation in hotel renovations is certainly a benefit to our clients and is one of the reasons we were selected to transform this property into an L7 hotel.” Located steps from the Chicago Riverwalk and the Magnificent Mile, the 14-story building constructed in 1912 is one of 50 landmarks featured in Living Landmarks of Chicago and served as a hat factory and headquarters of D.B. Fisk Co., the largest wholesale millinery in the country until 1932. The building was converted to the Oxford House Hotel in the 1950s. Ironically, McHugh served as general contractor of its conversion to Hotel Monaco shortly after Kimpton acquired the building in 1999, and McHugh performed a refresh of the guest rooms around 2011. Lotte Hotels & Resorts acquired the property in 2022 and hired McHugh for its conversion to an L7 hotel. ",The Loop

Black Ensemble Theater adjusts mixed-use development plan at 4427 N. Clark,"The Black Ensemble Theater has revised their plan for the Free to Be Village, their proposed mixed-use development plan at 4427 N. Clark. Planned for a site across the street from their existing space at 4450 N. Clark, the new building will rise at approximately 4427 N. Clark, replacing the one-story building that used to house the Japanese American Services Center and a parking lot. Designed by Gensler, the project is aimed at bringing an arts and cultural destination to Uptown while forwarding Black Ensemble Theater’s goals of eradicating racism through the arts. The original plan for the development called for a six-story residential building with a performing arts center attached. In response to concerns about the building height, its setback from the alley, and casting shadows onto the neighbors, the project was cut by one floor down to 59 feet in height from an originally planned 70-foot-tall building. The new design varies its setback from the alley and consolidated loading into one loading dock instead of two.  The revised five-story scheme will include a 14,000-square-foot Performing Arts Education Center, 7,000-square-foot Media and Technology Center, and 14,000 square feet of retail space. The residential component has actually increased from 50 to 53 affordable residential units designated for artists. Down from 92, there will be 89 parking spaces located at-grade along the alley and in a single level of underground parking. 53 bike parking spaces will be included in the building.  The ground floor of the building provides a literary cafe at the corner of the site near the intersection of W. Sunnyside Ave and N. Clark St, with the lobby to the performing arts education center to the south of it. A small portion of the retail sits just south of the performing arts education center lobby with the bulk of it occupying the southern end of the site. The residential lobby is accessed midway along the street frontage through the planned outdoor space along the street. With Site Design Group in charge of the landscaping, the project’s open space at the center of the site is viewed as the heart of the building, as a space to connect with the community and have them connect with the programming in the building. With two levels of public space, the design calls for a sloped walkway that creates an amphitheater of seating and planters to connect the public plaza to a public rooftop deck on the second floor. To close the upper terrace at night, a perforated screen wall creates an opportunity for commissioning an art piece or mural. The owner is seeking to rezone the site from C1-2 to B3-3 with a Planned Development designation. Approvals will be needed from Alderman Clay, the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and City Council. Construction is intended to begin on the Studio Theater in Q4 2024, while construction of the first phase of the Free to Be Village Phase 1 would begin in Q2 2026.

Willow Bridge announces pre-leasing at Solverre,"Solverre, a new residential development in Uptown is now pre-leasing and scheduled to open to residents this Spring. Developed by Willow Bridge, formerly known as Lincoln Property Company, the building is located at 4600 N. Marine on the site of a former parking lot to the south of Weiss Hospital along W.

Alderman Knudsen approves DePaul Basketball practice facility,"Alderman Timmy Knudsen has officially announced his approval of the DePaul Basketball practice facility. Planned for the northwest corner of W. Belden Ave and N. Sheffield Ave, the new facility will rise across the street from the current Sullivan Athletic Center. The site is home to four 1890s row houses as well as a 1925 courtyard building on the corner of W. Belden Ave and N. Sheffield Ave, all of which are owned by DePaul University. Designed by HNTB and Antunovich Associates, the new basketball facility will feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. The design has been tweaked with a refined brick facade design at the base of the building with large windows to make the activity in the building more visible from the street. The footprint of the building was also reduced so that the sidewalk could be widened for new landscaping and benches. Higher environmental standards and green amenities include bird-friendly glass and rooftop solar panels that will decrease energy use by more than 10%. Throughout the community engagement process, one of the main issues has been the planned demolition of the existing structures which include four 1890s rowhomes and a 1925 courtyard building. As a result of negotiations, DePaul will invest in the formal landmarking of the exteriors of Byrne Hall and Cortelyou Commons. Additionally, DePaul has also committed to preserving O’Connell Hall for future generations with an investment of several million dollars in maintaining its historic facade and other necessary upgrades. For the community, DePaul has reignited its ongoing commitment to engage with its neighbors. The Plan of Operation for the Proposed DePaul Facility includes a re-commitment by DePaul to community benefits they have provided for years, such as hosting public services like the post office and library, free neighborhood parking, discounted memberships to the Ray Meyer fitness center, and direct financial support to local nonprofits. In addition, this proposal outlines new community benefits such as expanded use of DePaul-owned facilities for youth sports leagues and community stakeholders and additional direct financial support to local nonprofits.  Expanding their commitment to community organizations, DePaul has agreed to provide use of McGrath-Phillips Arena or Wish Field for an annual event to each of seven Community Stakeholders. In addition to their investment in making an environmentally sound building, I am proud to share that DePaul has agreed to my office’s request that they install a significant number of electric vehicle charging stations on campus. These stations will be accessible to the public and operated by a vendor selected by the university. With approval from Alderman Timmy Knudsen secured, the $60 million project can seek city approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. If approved, the demolition of buildings on site would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest. Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026.  ",Lincoln Park

Wax Trax building gets preliminary landmark designation,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for Wax Trax! Located at 2449 N. Lincoln, life and business partners Jim Nash and Dannie Flesher opened the WAX TRAX! records store in 1978. Their shared passion for music inspired the retail venture and their personal tastes, creative generosity, and willingness to take risks shaped the store into an international source of eclectic and ground-breaking music. Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, WAX TRAX! invigorated Chicago’s music scene. With bootlegs, imports, and hard-to-find records, cassettes, CDs, and videos, WAX TRAX! became an international retail destination. WAX TRAX! helped to shape the world’s perceptions of Chicago music. As the home base of the WAX TRAX! record label, the store at 2449 North Lincoln helped to launch industrial-dance music, what became to be known as industrial music, in the United States.  WAX TRAX! opened at a time when society’s pendulum was swinging away from earlier decades’ idealism and freedom-focused liberation toward the New Right and nostalgic conservatism of the Reagan years. The store provided a rare refuge to outsiders and outcasts as a mecca and a meeting place for those most comfortable outside the mainstream. The arrival of WAX TRAX! in Chicago was monumental in terms of shaping Chicago’s music scene. WAX TRAX! was a favorite of director John Hughes in whose film's music played a key role. The building also meets Criterion 4 as an example of exemplary architecture. WAX TRAX! is a neighborhood store and flat building with an unusually high degree of ornamentation. It is a rare, early example of the use of glazed-brick cladding applied to a small-scale building. The building maintains an original Renaissance Revival cornice with a “broken pediment,” swags between curved brackets, a highly detailed central panel, and four acroterion and an obelisk projecting above the cornice’s horizontal elements. Carved Bedford limestone elements on the building’s façade include prominent window hoods and sills, and a first-floor cornice with mascarons (human faces) which are rarely found on a store and flat building.  The structure was built circa 1880s and re-fronted circa 1900 in white- and green-glazed brick. In the decades leading up to World War I, white-glazed brick and terra cotta took precedence over darker tones as the preferred cladding for dozens of skyscrapers built in the Chicago Loop.  Meeting the Integrity Criterion, WAX TRAX! possesses sufficient integrity to convey its historic architectural and cultural significance. The building remains in its original location within a low-scale but dense commercial setting. Additions to the structure have been at the rear and are not visible so have not negatively impacted the structure’s integrity. The original storefront and windows have been replaced, but this is typical for commercial structures of this age and can be reversed. The building largely retains its character-defining features, materials, and overall design and therefore sufficiently conveys its historic significance. Significant features of the building would be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building. With this preliminary recommendation approved, Landmarks staff will draft a detailed report before getting the Commission’s final recommendation. Once that is approved the proposed designation will head to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council.  ",Lincoln Park
City Council approves 2033 N. Kingsbury,"The Chicago City Council has approved Sterling Bay’s proposed mixed-use development at 2033 N. Kingsbury. Originally announced in September 2022, the project site is directly across the street from Lincoln Yards North. With a combination of low-rise retail buildings and parking lots surrounding the site, the tower will be a middle ground between the new high-density towers of Lincoln Yards and the low-rise neighbors along N. Clybourn Ave. Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the 25-story tower will hold 355 residential units. The project’s unit mix will include 49 studios, 40 convertibles, 186 one-beds, 70 two-beds, and 10 three-beds. To meet ARO requirements, 71 of the apartments will be set aside at a weighted average of 60% AMI. On the ground floor, the building has been setback with the residential entry at the middle of the project’s street frontage. 7,500 square feet of ground floor retail space will overlook the outdoor space at the south end of the site which will also include a dog run for residents. A private drive along the north end of the site will give residents access to 203 car parking spaces as well as a bike room with 360 bike parking spaces. The building’s design looks to minimize its impact on the site and the taller massing opens view corridors from Lincoln Yards towards the neighborhood to the east and avoids creating a long bar building where the original design created a wall within the neighborhood. The massing was further broken down by shifting the volume and using a facade design that incorporates a combination of brick, steel, and glass to articulate the building. With approval from City Council secured, the site will be rezoned from M2-2 to B3-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. Once financing is secured, the project is expected to follow a 24-month construction timeline. ",Lincoln Park

Plan Commission approves two-tower development at 1840 N. Marcey,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved Sterling Bay’s proposed two-tower development at 1840 N. Marcey. Located near Lincoln Yards, the project site is across the street from the former General Iron site. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the property is a long, rectangular site bound by N. Clifton Ave to the north, N. Kingsbury St to the west, N. Marcey St to the east, and W. Wisconsin St to the south.   Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the project’s design inspiration is based on the industrial history of the area, the Chicago city grid, and the Chicago River. The building massings began with a contextual base surrounded by open space, with stepped building masses that were extruded from the bases. The towers were offset to optimize sunlight for active terraces and to create better views for each building. As a result of community feedback, the south building’s height was reduced by 20 feet from 215 down to 195 feet. The north building was cut by 50 feet from 325 feet down to 275 feet. As part of the plan, the 615 units will be retained, while the parking count has been reduced from 360 spaces down to 275 spaces. The retail space is now 9,600 square feet down from the originally planned 17,600 square feet.  With parking underground in the south building, apartments will start on the second floor, giving a residential character and providing more eyes on the streets. The north building will have two podium levels of parking topped by an amenity deck. The towers will rise with apartment floors and the south building will be topped by a rooftop deck looking downtown and towards the river.  The 615 apartments will include 20% affordability, with 124 ARO units in the building at a weighted average of 60% AMI. Overall, the buildings will have 107 studios, 374 one-beds, 107 two-beds, and 27 three-beds. Of those, 21 studios, 76 one-beds, 21 two-beds, and 6 three-beds will be affordable.  The project’s site includes green space along N. Marcey St with an internal drive separating the two buildings. Residential lobbies will gace the green space with retail space fronting N. Clifton Ave in the north building and south towards N. Marcey St in the south building.  Sterling Bay is seeking to rezone from M2-3 to B3-3 with an overall Planned Development designation and 3.5 FAR bonus.

Planned by Contemporary Concepts Inc, the project site at the southeast corner of W. Diversey Pkwy and N. Seminary Ave is currently occupied by a former church building whose congregation is moving to a different location.  Designed by Studio Dwell Architects, the new development would stand five stories tall with 24 residential units. The residential units will be split into one one-bed, nine two-beds, 13 three-beds, and one four-bedroom unit. While four units will be set aside as affordable, the market rate units will be priced at $3000/month for two-beds, $4,000-$4,200/month for three-beds, and $5,500/month for the four-bedroom unit. Rising approximately 65 feet tall, the five-story building will be clad in brick with metal accent panels and a sawtooth brick pattern accent on the ground floor. The windows on the ground floor will feature limestone surrounds.  The building’s residential entry will front N. Seminary Ave, with five residential units and a bike room for 7 bikes on the ground floor. A single accessible parking space will be located along the alley. Two of the ground floor residential units will have private terraces. With approval from City Council secured, the site will be rezoned from RT-4 to B2-3. The developer can now move forward with permitting and construction which is expected to last approximately a year. Completion is targeted for Summer 2025. ",Lincoln Park
Plan Commission approves 2033 N. Kingsbury,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved Sterling Bay’s proposed mixed-use development at 2033 N. Kingsbury. Originally announced in September 2022, the project site is directly across the street from Lincoln Yards North. With a combination of low-rise retail buildings and parking lots surrounding the site, the tower will be a middle ground between the new high-density towers of Lincoln Yards and the low-rise neighbors along N. Clybourn Ave. Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the 25-story tower will hold 355 residential units. The project’s unit mix will include 49 studios, 40 convertibles, 186 one-beds, 70 two-beds, and 10 three-beds. To meet ARO requirements, 71 of the apartments will be set aside at a weighted average of 60% AMI. On the ground floor, the building has been setback with the residential entry at the middle of the project’s street frontage. 7,500 square feet of ground floor retail space will overlook the outdoor space at the south end of the site which will also include a dog run for residents. A private drive along the north end of the site will give residents access to 203 car parking spaces as well as a bike room with 360 bike parking spaces. The building’s design looks to minimize its impact on the site and the taller massing opens view corridors from Lincoln Yards towards the neighborhood to the east and avoids creating a long bar building where the original design created a wall within the neighborhood. The massing was further broken down by shifting the volume and using a facade design that incorporates a combination of brick, steel, and glass to articulate the building. Sterling Bay is looking to rezone the site from M2-2 to B3-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. With approval secured from the Chicago Plan Commission, the proposal will now go before the Committee on Zoning and full City Council to get final approvals. Once financing is secured, the project is expected to follow a 24-month construction timeline. ",Lincoln Park
Clybourn Place could get 520-foot-tall tower as part of redevelopment,"CRM Properties, the owner of Clybourn Place at 1800 N. Clybourn, is looking to overhaul the mostly vacant shopping center with plans that could include a 500-unit residential tower alongside a series of new retail buildings. Located in Lincoln Park, the property runs along N. Clybourn Ave and N. Sheffield Ave bisected by W. Willow St and bound by N. Marcey St to the west.  Dubbed the Willow Street District, the new plan designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative would see the new construction of 70,875 square feet of retail space supported by 447 enclosed and surface parking spaces as well as pedestrian walkways through the property.  Most of the existing buildings on the site would be demolished under the plan, aside from preserving part of the former Bed Bath & Beyond structure and two decorative masonry towers remaining from a William D. Gibson Co. Spring plant — and later a Turtle Wax plant — that was built on the site in 1908. The new retail building along Clybourn and Sheffield would get a third tower to mimic the historic two in the other buildings. A proposed residential tower would be sited on the southwest side of the site along N. Marcey St, replacing a vacant, single-story retail structure and surface parking. The approximately 520-foot-tall tower would have 500 luxury rental units with additional parking for residents.  The developer plans to build out the new retail space first before approaching developing the tower. According to CoStar, a representative from the developer stated that retail construction would be done by early 2026 after which they would go back to the city to get final approvals for the residential tower.

City Council approves 450-foot-tall tower at 1565 N. Clybourn,"The Chicago City Council has approved New York-based developer The Georgetown Company’s plans for a mixed-use tower at 1565 N. Clybourn. Located at the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Halsted St, the new development will replace the retail structure that formerly held the Bank of America branch. The developer owns the four-story parking garage and the retail structure with Design Within Reach and will retain both of those structures as part of the development. With bKL Architecture on board for the design, the team sought to create something special and unique for the prominent gateway site for this area. The new mixed-use tower will rise with a very slender massing, tapering at the ends to create a unique profile. The tower’s glass and metal facade will come down to the ground without a large parking podium, meeting the ground in an elegant and pedestrian-friendly way. The facade switches to a masonry expression at the base with punched window openings to relate to the pedestrian scale. Rising 37 stories, the 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 residential units, with 79 of them set aside as affordable. The unit mix will feature 99 studios, 264 one-beds, and 33 two-beds. The 79 affordable units will include 26 units at 30% AMI, 7 units at 40% AMI, and 46 units at 80% AMI. The ground floor will front N. Clybourn Ave with 2,500 square feet of retail space, with the residential entry facing back to the internal drive and north towards the pedestrian plaza designed by Confluence. Amenity space will be located on the third floor with an outdoor cutout in the building massing as well as rooftop amenities on the 37th floor which will include an outdoor pool. In regard to parking, the new building will have no new car parking spaces but will include 396 bike parking spaces on the third floor. The existing parking garage behind the new construction has 158 parking spaces. The developer plans to make 70 of them available to residents, 73 available for retail parking, and 15 spaces for employees. An internal private drive that currently exists will remain for internal circulation as well as drop off and loading. With approval secured, the site will be rezoned from its existing PD to B3-5 and the Planned Development will be reinstated.

"Redevelopment plan for Cabrini Green could total over 5,000 units","The Chicago Housing Authority recently presented a redevelopment plan for the remaining Cabrini Green sites. Developed as part of Cabrini NOW, the community-driven planning and design effort looks to improve the Cabrini neighborhood through new housing and economic development on CHA properties. SCB is the architect working on the masterplans. Generally bound by W. North Ave to the north, the Brown Line tracks to the east, W. Chicago Ave to the south, and N. Halsted St to the west, the plan encompasses 16 different parcels including vacant parcels and the vacant Francis Cabrini Rowhomes. The design strategies are split into the southern and northern sites divided by W. Division St. -- Northern Sites The northern sites center around the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Larrabee St as well as the sites along W. Division St between N. Halsted St and N. Cleveland Ave. Totaling 16 acres of land, all of the plans will preserve Strangers Home Missionary Baptist Church with a public open plaza in front of it. The first development strategy for the northern sites will total 1,050 residential units which will include 104 townhomes and 946 multifamily units. The 1.2 million square foot plan would have 0.3 acres of open space and 565 parking spaces. The plan would concentrate larger buildings at the Division/Halsted intersection while complementing the scale of existing development along N. Larrabee St and N. Clybourn Ave corridors. The scheme would provide less housing than the market would suggest, potentially leading to difficulty financing this development plan. The second development strategy would have 1,450 residential units split between 50 townhomes and 1,400 multifamily units. The 1.5 million square foot plan would have 0.3 acres of open space while providing 730 parking spaces. The scheme would match the mid-rise scale of CHA Near North developments to date while the largest buildings are still concentrated on the Division/Halsted intersection. This version would have the potential to highlight Strangers Home Missionary Baptist Church but would have fewer low-rise buildings overall. As the densest version, the third development scenario has 2,000 residential units with no townhomes and all of the units in multifamily buildings. The 1.9 million square foot plan would have a full acre of open space and 665 parking spaces. The plan provides the greatest amount of housing with a greater chance of successful development financing. It would have the most open space, have potential for a new fire station on N. Larrabee St, and have the potential to highlight Strangers Home Missionary Baptist Church. This version has the least amount of low-scale development, taller buildings are spread more evenly across the sites, and the potential new fire station could complicate the development process. -- Southern Sites The southern sites span from W. Chicago Ave up to W. Oak St with a total of nine parcels that total approximately 27 acres. The sites include the vacant Cabrini Rowhomes. The first development strategy for the southern sites will total 2,000 residential units which will include 215 renovated townhomes, 35 new townhomes and 1,940 multifamily units. The 2 million square foot plan would have a full acre of open space and 650 parking spaces. The plan would have an improved pedestrian environment and vehicular connectivity while preserving most of the vacant rowhomes. New medium scale development on N. Cambridge Ave allows for more housing while Seward and Durso Parks would be connected via a dedicated open space for a commemorative walk. The costly renovations of the historic buildings would yield fewer units while historic structures are isolated from new neighborhood development. The second scheme for the southern sites will total 1,800 residential units which will include 125 renovated townhomes, 15 new townhomes and 1,985 multifamily units. The 1.7 million square foot plan would have a full acre of open space and 600 parking spaces. The plan would have an improved pedestrian environment and vehicular connectivity with less costs associated with moderate historic preservation. Historic structures are less isolated from new neighborhood development and Seward and Durso Parks would be connected via a dedicated open space for a commemorative walk. Preserving N. Mohawk Ave and N. Cleveland Ave limits block sizes and the amount of housing the sites can accommodate while costly renovations of the large number of historic buildings yields the fewest residential units. The final scheme for the southern sites totals 2,050 residential units with 65 renovated townhomes, 15 new townhomes, and 1,970 multifamily units. The 2 million square foot plan would have a full acre of open space and 650 parking spaces. The plan would have the most new housing as limited historic preservation allows for more efficient allocation of financial resources. The plan would have an improved pedestrian environment and vehicular connectivity and Seward and Durso Parks would be connected via a dedicated open space for a commemorative walk. A disadvantage of the plan is that there is less historic preservation and limited preservation of street and neighborhood character. -- After receiving community feedback, the team will refine the concepts, undergo a feasibility analysis, and develop documentation. The final Cabrini NOW reports will be submitted in October or November of this year. ",Near North

Gensler reimagines North Michigan Ave corridor,"In a time where Michigan Avenue’s status as a key anchor for the city is in flux post-COVID, global architecture firm Gensler has developed a vision for the corridor in collaboration with veteran real estate investors and brokers Bob Wislow and Camille Julmy of Parkside Realty. The COVID era undoubtedly damaged high streets across the world. North Michigan Avenue saw 6.5 million fewer visits per year, accompanied by a 74% increase in crime; 25-35% decrease in property tax value; massive losses of sales, hotel, and entertainment taxes; and over 2,000 jobs lost. Despite these challenges, the district continues to employ and entertain residents from all 50 city wards while still generating 18% of citywide hospitality spending, hosting visitors from around the world.   North Michigan Avenue was ready for its next evolution prior to COVID, having not seen major transformation since the 1990s, but today – given the changes in consumer habits, expectations, and lifestyles resulting from the pandemic – it is urgently poised for reinvention. Chicago’s economy, job market, global reputation, and culture depend on it.   ""Michigan Avenue is a vital engine of commerce, tourism, and culture in Chicago, and it's worth investing in its evolution to ensure it is an accessible, dynamic, vibrant part of our city for years to come,"" said Benjy Ward, Design Principal at Gensler.  By researching the shared components of global high streets and the current situation on Michigan Avenue, the team identified the northern end of North Michigan Avenue, between Chicago Avenue and Oak Street Beach, as the area with the greatest potential to elevate the North Michigan Avenue experience.  At Jane Byrne Park, the vision includes a road diet along N. Michigan Ave creates more pedestrian space, bench planters that create a canopy over the park, cafe kiosk to offer food and beverage, an interactive water feature, projection art, and colorful bistro tables to offer seating.  Along the entire streetscape, the corridor’s envisioned road diet would make way for improvements that include art, seating, planters, cafe kiosks, lighting, performance platforms, smart pavers, and safety concierge and cameras.  At the northern end of N. Michigan Ave, the vision looks to reimagine Oak Street Beach and better connect it to the corridor with a large sweeping pedestrian bridge over Lake Shore Drive. The park will be extended down N. Michigan Ave along the Drake Hotel and redesigned north of E. Oak St.  While the visionary images have been shared with the city, there is currently no specific timeline for implementing the concept.

On the interior, the ground floor will be mostly occupied by retail space, fronting N. Franklin St, W. Locust St, and the new park to the east. The residential lobby will face N. Franklin St and have amenity space included next to it. The upper four floors of the building will have the planned 44 residential units.  The design of 871 N. Franklin recently underwent some changes, including the removal of the east addition that was planned. While the east facade will still be rebuilt, it will stay in line with where the current facade is. Minor adjustments were made to the building’s interior layout and its upper setbacks were reduced on the new floors.  With Power Construction serving as the general contractor, this final renovation permit that was issued will allow for the full construction of the new addition to the building and the completion of the build out of the new residential units. A timeline for the building’s completion is currently unclear. ",Near North

Zoning application filed for slender tower at 1565 N. Clybourn,"New York-based developer The Georgetown Company has submitted a rezoning application for their proposed mixed-use tower at 1565 N. Clybourn. Located at the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Halsted St, the new development will replace the retail structure that formerly held the Bank of America branch. The developer owns the four-story parking garage and the retail structure with Design Within Reach and will retain both of those structures as part of the development. With bKL Architecture on board for the design, the team sought to create something special and unique for the prominent gateway site for this area. The new mixed-use tower will rise with a very slender massing, tapering at the ends to create a unique profile. The tower’s glass and metal facade will come down to the ground without a large parking podium, meeting the ground in an elegant and pedestrian-friendly way. The facade switches to a masonry expression at the base with punched window openings to relate to the pedestrian scale. Rising 37 stories, the 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 residential units, with 79 of them set aside as affordable. The unit mix is still in flux, but will include a mix of studios, convertibles, one-beds, and two-beds. The ground floor will front N. Clybourn Ave with 2,500 square feet of retail space, with the residential entry facing back to the internal drive and north towards the pedestrian plaza designed by Confluence. Amenity space will be located on the third floor with an outdoor cutout in the building massing as well as rooftop amenities on the 37th floor which will include an outdoor pool. In regard to parking, the new building will have no new car parking spaces but will include 396 bike parking spaces on the third floor. The existing parking garage behind the new construction has 158 parking spaces. The developer plans to make 70 of them available to residents, 73 available for retail parking, and 15 spaces for employees. An internal private drive that currently exists will remain for internal circulation as well as drop off and loading. During a recent community meeting, some neighbors expressed concern over congestion in the neighborhood and the parking count for the project. The development team explained that the project’s status as a transit-served location with its proximity to the North/Clybourn L stop and CTA bus stops indicate a lower demand for parking. The development team said they are confident that the proposed parking ratio will sufficiently serve the residents and pointed out DPD’s encouragement to reduce parking near transit as part of their latest TOD ordinances. While they are at the beginning of the process, the developer is looking to rezone the site from its existing PD to B3-5 and then reinstate the Planned Development. The proposal needs approvals from Alderman Hopkins, the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. If approvals move forward according to plan, construction could begin in early 2025 with a 20–22-month construction timeline.  ",Near North
Urbanize tours 868 N. Wells at North Union,"Urbanize has visited the construction site of 868 N. Wells, the latest residential tower at North Union. Planned by JDL Development, the building occupies a rectangular site along N. Wells St stretching from W. Chestnut St to W. Locust St. With a design by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, 868 N. Wells will stand 26 floors high with 411 rental units and 12,000 square feet of retail space. Touring with Power Construction and JDL Development, the tour began by heading up to the top of the building to the 26th floor. Set to hold the building’s amenity spaces, the floor is enclosed but sits raw with construction equipment filling up the space. At the south end, the amenity space will open up to an outdoor deck that includes a rooftop pool. An outdoor dog run will be included on the west side of the amenity level. Going one floor down, the 25th level will be the top residential floor. The floor plate is fully enclosed with the glass facade and the first mechanical systems are being installed. Working our way down the building, our next stop was the two duplex apartments on the north end of the building’s 20th and 21st floors. The 21st floor shows the units fully framed with crews installing electrical wiring during our walkthrough. On the 20th floor, crews were closing up the walls with drywall.  Heading down the building, our next stop was the 12th floor, where drywall and paint has been completed, with cabinets going in for the units’ kitchens. Stopping at the third floor, we next saw some finished units that have kitchens and bathrooms installed as well as flooring and all other finishes. Residents will benefit from nine and a half feet high ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows that give unencumbered views of the city around it. On the ground floor, we walked through the future retail space that will face north and west into the future park space. As part of the first phase of North Union, the park will open at the same time as 868 N. Wells. JDL Development plans to begin pre-leasing at the end of April 2024, with Power Construction turning over the building in July 2024 for late-Summer 2024 move-ins. As construction wraps up on 868 N. Wells, JDL Development is pushing ahead on the rest of the first phase. The existing structure at 871 N. Franklin will get a two-story addition and be converted into apartments with another restaurant tenant planned for the retail space facing the park. 220 W. Chestnut already has its foundations and parking structure poured underground but its residential programming is still yet to be finalized. ",Near North

According to the developer, it's time to reignite the energy and pride of this historic neighborhood. With local architect JGMA in charge of the design, the multifamily residential and mixed-use project features an outdoor museum, honoring Bronzeville’s rich heritage and iconic musicians. The three buildings will use a unique facade system to show iconic musicians and people of significance for Bronzeville while hosting residential units and retail space inside them. It's a catalyst for positive change, preserving the community's heartbeat while celebrating its diversity. -- The final site is Site 6, measuring 55,500 square feet located south of E. Oakwood Blvd at 3950 S. Lake Park. Developers CBBC have teamed up with DOM Properties to create a multifamily building on the site. Designed by Valerio Dewalt Train Associates, the building takes the form of a mid-rise multifamily building that creates a U-shape in plan with a courtyard in the center. Two-story townhomes are situated along the street, enclosing the courtyard and buffering the taller building from the street.  As the concepts progress, DPD will award the sites to the selected development teams who will then need to proceed with the typical approval processes to make the concepts become a reality.

Cook County Health plans health center in Lake Meadows Pavilion,"Cook County Health announced that it will be opening a new community health center at 467 E. 31st Street, Chicago in Bronzeville. Bronzeville Health Center will join CCH’s portfolio of more than a dozen community health centers located across Chicago and suburban Cook County. As one of the largest public health systems in the nation, CCH is dedicated to creating access to high quality, comprehensive health care services to the residents of Cook County regardless of ability to pay. “The Bronzeville Health Center represents Cook County’s ongoing commitment to ensuring equitable access to high-quality health care services,” said Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. “The health center holds the promise of not only addressing the immediate health needs of the community, but also fostering long-term improvements in health outcomes on Chicago’s South Side.”   Anchored by CCH’s historic Provident Hospital, Bronzeville Health Center will offer family medicine, behavioral health, and rehabilitation services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. The 26,000 square foot facility is projected to see 85,000 visits in its first year and will include 44 exam rooms and a gym space for therapy services. The family medicine and behavioral health practices are moving from their existing location within Provident Hospital’s Sengstacke Health Center into Bronzeville Health Center, which offers a larger, more modern space to better serve patients. The move also frees up more clinical space within Provident Hospital to allow for the expansion of hospital-based services, further enhancing access to care. Patients will continue to be able to receive comprehensive primary and specialty outpatient care at Sengstacke Health Center as well.  Bronzeville Health Center represents the latest expansion of CCH’s services on Chicago’s South Side. CCH has spent more than $9M to grow clinical services and modernize the Provident Hospital campus since 2020.  Now, the Cook County Bureau of Asset Management and CCH are investing $10M to build out and furnish the new Bronzeville Health Center.

PRC approves South Side Community Arts Center expansion,"The Permit Review Committee has approved plans for the expansion and renovation of the South Side Community Arts Center. Located at 3831 S. Michigan, the project will combine the existing midblock site with the two lots to the north of the existing property to create a larger property for the project.  Designed by Future Firm, the project will renovate the landmarked home and build a three-story addition on the back of the property connected to the house. On the exterior, the landmarked home will get a new cornice and windows as well as masonry and roof repairs. The interior landmarked spaces will be retained in the house. A coach house at the back of the site will be demolished. As part of the reconfiguration, the home and addition will get new galleries, meeting rooms, archive space, support, and other spaces. Historic information indicates that the wooden planks of the Burroughs Gallery used to be much lighter, so the team plans to remove the stain through a chemical process to bring it back to its original state. While the wooden planks are removed, additional insulation will be added into the walls to improve the thermal performance of the building envelope. Other non-original finishes including tile and paint will be removed to restore the original condition of interior spaces. To connect the new addition to the historic home, a small kitchen wing will be demolished. The addition itself is at the back of the site so that the main building can remain in the foreground. The portion north of the home will be a two-story structure clad in rainscreen paneling with an accessible approach made of light-colored concrete. The addition will step up to three stories behind the house and be clad in glass curtain wall. The small portion just south of the home will have the rainscreen paneling on the first two floors and glass curtain wall on the third floor.  Due to a deadline to spend one of the organization’s funding grants, the team plans to use an early design package to allocate those funds before starting full construction in April 2025.

City celebrates opening of Damen Green Line station,"Mayor Brandon Johnson today joined 27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett, Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) President Dorval R. Carter, Jr., Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) Commissioner Tom Carney and Near West Side stakeholders to announce the opening of the new CTA Damen Green Line station at Lake St and Damen Ave. “This new station is a transformational achievement for our city,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “The long-awaited Damen Green Line on the Near West Side of Chicago will have a multiplying effect on this neighborhood, attracting future investments for a vibrant hub of multi-use developments.”   The new Damen Green Line station fills a 1.5-mile service gap between Ashland and California stops, restoring rail service to the neighborhood for the first time since the original station was closed at this location in 1948. The station serves the Kinzie Industrial Corridor, the United Center, Malcolm X College, and the surrounding residential area on the growing Near West Side. This includes the Chicago Housing Authority’s Westhaven Park IID, a $50 million, equitable transit-oriented development (eTOD) project adding 96 mixed-income apartments in the community.   The station provides easy access to CTA buses, space for pedestrians to walk, and bike-sharing options. CDOT announced the installation of the City's 1,000th Divvy station at the Damen Green Line, helping the station serve as a multi-modal facility to provide various sustainable and equitable transportation options for the neighborhood.   The $80 million TIF-funded project was administered by CDOT in close collaboration with the CTA. Designed by Perkins&Will, the project was built by construction contractor F.H. Paschen. Station materials and design elements were chosen and arranged to create an intuitive user experience and to allow for a long-lasting transit facility with low-maintenance requirements. A grand stair and escalator, visible through the transparent glass façade, guide passengers to the platform level. A glass bridge connects the inbound and outbound train platforms, offering spectacular views of the Chicago skyline and orienting visitors to neighborhood destinations and attractions. The bridge's visible structure references Chicago's iconic steel bridges.    The new station also features a large mural by the noted artist, Folayemi Wilson, that highlights the rich history of various ethnic groups on the Near West Side. The mural depicts a scene on the prairie with images of young people taken from local photographic archives peering towards the horizon and imagining their future. Wilson was commissioned for the work by the City’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE). The CTA includes artwork in its new stations to not only further enhance the space, but also create a connection with the surrounding community and inspire those who travel through the facility.    ",Near West Side

Spearheaded by the Reinsdorf and Wirtz families, The 1901 Project will transform the parking lots surrounding the United Center with new development, bridging neighborhoods and enhancing opportunities for residents, businesses and all of Chicago. “The 1901 Project represents a continuation of our families’ 100-years-and-counting commitment to the future of Chicago’s West Side,” Reinsdorf said. “This investment will create a thriving, interconnected neighborhood, delivering significant benefits and resources to the community we have long called home.” The 1901 Project is a long-term, multi-phased development vision spanning an estimated ten years. The first phase of the project aims to begin in spring 2025 on property that is today surface parking lots adjacent to the arena.  The initial phase will feature a 6,000-seat capacity theater-style music hall. The intimate, premier venue is designed to attract music, arts and cultural events, enhancing Chicago’s entertainment industry. Innovative green space is strategically integrated on the west side of the campus including on top of parking garages, providing more than 25 acres of public recreational and community gathering space. The plan calls for reimagined parking facilities and an improved pedestrian experience with enhanced walkability, lighting, roads and bike lanes uniquely designed to blend into the development. A mix of hospitality and retail options aimed at boosting local commerce and creating jobs have been incorporated into the plan as well. “The vision for The 1901 Project is to bring impactful investment and economic opportunity to the West Side that compliments and supports its rich history and galvanizes its vibrancy,” Wirtz said. “We aim to create a development alongside our neighbors to deliver jobs, housing, commerce and community resources, creating a more prosperous future for all residents.” Future phase development envisions housing that spans various unit sizes and includes affordable, market rate and luxury housing to ensure a vibrant mix of residential offerings for single persons and families.  Transportation enhancements will better connect the neighborhood through multi-modal means including bike, pedestrian, car and rail enhancements.  Immersed in green spaces and sustainability features as well as decorative lighting, pedestrian plazas and landscaping will also aid in community safety and accessibility. All in, the $7B investment is set to deliver substantial economic benefits to the West Side, with an estimated $9.5 billion in direct economic impact and $40 million in stabilized tax revenue, providing significant financial support to local public services and infrastructure. The transformative development is estimated to create approximately 63,000 construction jobs, offering extensive employment opportunities during the development phase. Additionally, upon completion, The 1901 Project will support around 12,000 permanent jobs, fostering long-term economic growth and stability for the community. These investments will not only enhance the economic landscape throughout Chicago but also improve the quality of life for residents long left without such opportunities on Chicago’s West Side.

CTA announces reopening of Forest Park Blue Line tracks,"The Chicago Transit Authority has announced the completion of major track work as part of Phase 1 of the Forest Park Branch Rebuild. Blue Line trains are now running between the O’Hare and Forest Park stations, making all stops for the first since late-July. “Thanks to the coordination and tireless work from across the agency, this line-cut has finished on-time and on-budget— a timely benefit to the entire Blue Line,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “We knew that project work of this scale would be a disruption to our riders, which is why we kept an aggressive pace for the line-cut, working around the clock to resume normal service along our second busiest rail line.” As part of this $268 million project, crews have completely rebuilt almost three miles of track, between the LaSalle and Illinois Medical District (IMD) stations in 11 weeks. Additional work planned as part of Phase 1 project work continues, including the complete reconstruction of the Racine main station entrance and auxiliary entrance, as well as construction of the new Morgan substation. As the work was planned to minimize impact on customers, CTA sequenced the project to complete the trackwork with bus shuttle support and then complete the signal work while trains are running.  As such, trains will run temporarily at a reduced speed between LaSalle and IMD and then gradually increase up to the posted speed.  The full speed restoration is anticipated by the end of this year. Anticipated impacts to Blue Line service are expected in 2024-2025 as the remaining portions of Phase 1 project work is completed. Crews are continuing work to upgrade the traction power system that provides electricity to the system and will result in improved service reliability for the Blue Line. This work entails the construction of a new substation over the right-of-way at Morgan Street, as well as other upgrades being made to power system components in the area. The existing Racine station has already been demolished and crews have begun to rebuild the Racine main station entrance to make it fully accessible to those who use mobility devices. The station house at the main Racine entrance will include a new elevator. In addition to the elevator, a longer platform and new stairs will replace the ramp that once connected the platform to street level at Racine Avenue. The main entrance of the Racine station will remain closed and is expected to re-open in late-2024, at which time the Loomis St. auxiliary entrance will close for reconstruction through 2025. The Loomis St. auxiliary entrance of the Racine station reopened following the completion of track work.  ",Near West Side

Any development on the western end of the site would require a fully separate review and approval process. ",Near West Side
Renderings emerge for Canal Station redevelopment,"Renderings have emerged for the redevelopment of Canal Station. Located at 801 S. Canal, the 850,000-square-foot building is being reimagined by New York-based 601W. Spanning almost an entire city block between W. Polk St and W. Taylor St, the six-story building used to be leased by Northern Trust.   With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board, the design will take advantage of the existing high bay large floor plates, concrete structure, loading docks, and utility infrastructure to deliver a highly amenitized workplace that can meet the needs of a broad range of tenants. Significant upgrades to the building façade allow for more natural light within the building, as well create a new identity for the building’s main entry. The lobby will be completely reimagined, incorporating a new monumental stair and a signature media screen. A new security desk is envisioned as a sculptural art form, serving as a central focal point within the generous volume of the lobby. Layered materials and textures of bleached maple, cold-rolled steel metal screens, and concrete floors offer a sophisticated urban ambiance and sense of welcome to the space. New retail spaces envisioned for cafes or bars open to the lobby, activating the space. A new tenant amenity package will measure 30,000 square feet, including a 7,300-square-foot outdoor terrace, a 5,000-square-foot fitness center, a tenant lounge and a conference center. Most floors will come with small, private outdoor terrace spaces for office tenants. 601W plans to offer tenants a shuttle bus along Canal Street to Union Station and Ogilvie Transportation Center, as well as 375 on-site parking spaces and new streetscapes next to the building. The $265 million is currently under construction and is targeted for completion by the end of the year. ",Near West Side
Office to residential conversion proposed at 500 N. Michigan,"Connecticut-based developer Commonwealth Development Partners is looking to convert the office building at 500 N. Michigan into residential. Located along the Mag Mile, the 304-foot-tall, 24-story building was originally built 1968 and houses a series of retail tenants with most of its office space vacant. Designed by GREC Architects, the building would be converted into 320 residential dwelling units on floors 6-23. Retail would remain on the first two floors with office space retained on the third through fifth floors. Residents would have access to amenity space on the seventh floor as well as a new rooftop amenity space on the 24th floor. This top floor amenity space would be both indoor and outdoor but would require additional FAR to be obtained through the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund bonus framework while also increasing the building height from 304 feet to 321 feet.  The building has a parking garage on the basement with valet service that can accommodate 68 cars. Access is from Lower Illinois St and would be continued as valet service after the conversion. The redevelopment will need to amend the existing Planned Development for the project. Approvals will be needed from Alderman Reilly, the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and City Council. ",River North
Zoning filed to sunset approved development at 225 W. Chicago,"A zoning application has been filed by developer Centrum Realty & Development to sunset the approved Planned Development located at 225 W. Chicago. Also known by the address of 777 N. Franklin, the project site is located at the southeast corner of the intersection of W. Chicago Ave and N. Franklin St, directly adjacent to the Chicago/Franklin CTA Brown Line station. Designed by local architect Hirsch MPG, the nine-story office building planned for the site was approved by City Council in April 2020. The 123,000-square-foot building would have included 5,200 square feet of retail space on the ground floor with the remaining floors providing leasable office space. Office tenants would have had access to amenities on the top floor that would’ve included a fitness center, conference center, and lounge. Now listed for sale by CBRE, the marketing brochure touts the site’s approved Planned Development which locks the property into the office scheme, but also offers the rezoning as a way to open up the property to other options. If rezoned back to DX-5 like the rezoning seeks to, a new developer could build as many as 121 residential units with a 3.1 FAR bonus or also pursue other uses like hotel or mixed-use. For the zoning change to move forward, approvals will be needed from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. The property is listed with an asking price of $5.75 million. ",River North
Demolition permits issued for historic structures at Wells/Superior,"Demolition permits have been issued for two historic structures that are set to meet the wrecking ball at the southwest corner of N. Wells St and W. Superior St. First announced in February, the demolition is being planned by Topography Hospitality and KF Partners LLC and the structures are set to be replaced by a five-story new development, but the scope of that project is unclear. The three-story brick and wood framed structure at 720 N. Wells was built near the time of the Chicago Fire but is green-rated on the Chicago Historic Resources Survey with no protections from demolition. The Italianate structure at 207 W. Superior is estimated to be from the 1880s and is listed as orange-rated on the Chicago Historic Resources Survey. It was placed on the 90-day demolition delay list in mid-2023 and was ultimately released in August 2023. Permits list Milburn Demolition as the demolition contractor and work is expected to proceed through June. According to Alderman Reilly’s newsletter, the new development is expected to begin in September of this year, but no permits have been filed. ",River North
Landmark recommendation approved for the John B. Murphy Memorial,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the John B. Murphy Memorial. Located at 50 E. Erie, the building was completed in 1926 for the American College of Surgeons (ACS) as a memorial to one of its founders, Dr. John B. Murphy, who was a surgeon and teacher committed to improving the art and science of surgical practice.  The building meets Criterion 1 for its heritage. The John B. Murphy Memorial represents the legacy and lasting ideals of Dr. Murphy for the reform of surgical practice through the establishment of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). The ACS occupied the building as an auditorium with office and library spaces from its completion in 1926 through the 1930s, and as an occasional professional meeting hall until 2003. The memorial building was built with donations from over 2,000 Chicagoans and was transferred as a gift to the ACS as part of their permanent home and headquarters in Chicago. Locating the ACS in Chicago was intended to make Chicago the center of both surgical research and of the profession.   Meeting Criterion 3 for its association with a significant person, the memorial building is named for Dr. John B. Murphy, who was a critical and significant figure in helping reform and organize the practice of surgery in the United States. He was a founding member of the ACS, which was founded in 1913 to organize the profession and establish academic and professional standards, as well as standards for surgical practice and hospital design. Dr. Murphy was a leader in surgery who developed and improved many surgical procedures and also established a new way to teach surgical methods through clinical classroom operations on real patients and by publishing his lectures in his own non-commercial journal.  Also meeting Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture, the Murphy Memorial's exterior design represents a rare Chicago example of the French Renaissance style, known for its classically inspired details. The exterior is of Bedford limestone with an exceptional set of bronze doors and carved ornamental detailing. It includes brackets, pediments, columns, capitals, garlands, cartouches, finials, and other classical ornament. The interior is finely crafted with materials that include marble, highly ornate plasterwork, carved woodwork, cast and wrought metal, and stained glass.  The building also meets Criterion 5 for its important architect, the firm of Marshall & Fox. The firm was very popular for designing theaters, residences, hotels, clubs, and commercial buildings. The firm brought Classical elegance combined with modern luxury to these building types. Benjamin Marshall is acknowledged as one of the most important and influential architects in Chicago during the first decades of the twentieth century. His work in the design of theaters contributed to the overall interior design and layout of the Murphy Memorial's main auditorium.   The final criterion was Criterion 7 for its unique visual features. The Murphy Memorial's highly ornamented facade, monumental scale, and slight setback from the street make it a visually prominent building that is highly visible along Erie Street, between Rush Street and Wabash Avenue.  The building's form as a memorial, with its symmetrical facade defined by paired stairs, grand bronze doors, and a carved limestone portico with paired columns and a pediment, makes it a highly unique and rare building type in Chicago.   Also meeting the Integrity Criterion, the building possesses excellent physical integrity in its exterior and interior. The most significant alterations occurred in 2003 when two elevators and three-story additions were built between the memorial building's west elevation and the east elevation of the Nickerson Mansion. New windows were also added on the top level of the east elevation. Alterations to the interior lobbies, stairwells, and the auditorium include select new lighting and some audio-visual equipment. Despite these changes, the building retains its ability to express its architectural and historical value. The commission staff recommends the significant features to be protected be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building as well as the major historic interior spaces including the lobby leading to the auditorium from the bronze doors, the anteroom to the west of the auditorium, and the auditorium itself. The designation includes a provision to allow for the modifications planned by the Driehaus Museum as part of their renovation of the structure. With the final recommendation approved, the proposed designation will now go before the Committee on Zoning and City Council for final approval. ",River North

Permits are in the works for hotel development at 430 N. LaSalle,"Permits have been filed for a long-awaited hotel development at 430 N. LaSalle. Located at the northwestern corner of N. LaSalle Dr and W. Hubbard St, the project site is currently a surface parking lot. Planned by Porritt Group, the 16-story hotel building is planned to have 341 hotel rooms with a rooftop lounge and deck. Representing a scaled back plan, the originally approved scheme called for a 19-story tower that would’ve stood 235 feet tall with 196 hotel rooms.  Designed by Saroki Architecture, the 170,000 square foot development would be clad in a glass curtain wall with an inset in the building’s massing at the top for the outdoor deck. The building will have zero parking spaces. Originally approved back in September 2016, the developer received a one-year sunset extension for the Planned Development back in September 2022, avoiding the expiration of the approved Planned Development.

Salesforce Tower celebrates opening,"Salesforce has officially opened the doors of Salesforce Tower Chicago. Situated at the convergence of the north and south branches of the Chicago River, Salesforce Tower Chicago will serve as a beacon of Salesforce’s culture and our values, and a central gathering place for employees, customers, partners, and Trailblazers from around the world. The top two floors in the 57-story office building are dedicated ‘Ohana Floors, spaces for their employees and guests to enjoy during the day, and available for local nonprofits to host fundraising events at night and on weekends at no cost. To date, the company’s ‘Ohana Floors around the world have helped raise more than $108 million for local communities. For Salesforce Tower Chicago, the company has applied all they’ve learned post-pandemic to design spaces for how employees work today. When employees first came back to the office, it was primarily for collaboration, whether it be presentations, team off-sites, or brainstorms. Now that teams are coming in regularly, we’re also hearing that they need space for heads-down, focused work. Throughout the building, the design prioritizes flexibility and employee choice to ensure every individual and team can be successful. The employee floors have been designed to provide focus spaces, like libraries and focus pods, and areas for team collaboration and connection, like event spaces and communal kitchens. These zones are separated acoustically at opposite ends of the floor to support a neurodiverse population and offer more choices for employees. Throughout the workspaces are a mix of mindfulness rooms, pods of height-adjustable desks, and meeting and training rooms. The library spaces provide a variety of individual work settings, including natural light at some seats or, if employees choose, darker spaces with tactile surfaces and task lighting for user control. We’ve doubled the size of the social lounges on our employee floors to allow teams to transform these spaces for bespoke events and use them throughout the day as a working cafe. We’ve also added more conference and training rooms and flexible meeting space, equipped with the latest hybrid-work technology and room layouts to ensure our teams can connect with colleagues and customers around the world. As one of their most sustainable buildings to date, Salesforce Tower Chicago is on track to achieve LEED v4 Gold Certification for the exterior of the building, LEED v4 Platinum for the interiors, and Zero Carbon Certification. The building is also powered by all-electric systems, meaning there is no on-site use of fossil fuels. It is the first building in Chicago to require Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to quantify the embodied carbon emissions of concrete and steel, resulting in a 19% overall reduction in carbon emissions compared to the industry average.

Urbanize tours progress at 741 N. Wells,"Urbanize recently toured progress on Vista Property’s latest development in Chicago at 741 N. Wells. Formerly occupied by a one-story retail building and three-story structure, the new tower will rise just off W. Chicago Ave, offset by a historic brick building that will be retained at 755 N.

The building will include 50 studios, 101 one-bedrooms and 17 two-bedrooms, as well as a rooftop terrace with pool, meeting facilities, exercise area, bicycle storage for 150 bikes and parking for 51 cars. With Skender Construction leading the construction for the project and our walkthrough, we began by heading up to the top of the building. With the 19th floor slab poured just a couple days ahead, our tour began on the 18th floor where scaffolding is in place holding up the deck above. Looking out from the building, you can already see the expansive views that future residents will have. Nearby developments visible include JDL Development’s 920 N. Wells at North Union, North Wells Capital’s 311 W. Huron, Sterling Bay’s 360 N. Green in the distance, and Structured Development’s Big Deahl tower rising in the distance further north.  Heading down the building, a few of the floors right below 18 still have pole shores in place as the concrete decks fully cure. Our next stop was the 8th floor, where the facade is being installed. Designed as a window wall system, crews working further ahead install metal tracks on the concrete slabs for window pieces to clip into. Crews lift the individual window wall pieces into place, locking and sealing them as they go.  Working our way down, we stopped briefly on the sixth floor, where framing has been installed around the stairwells and workers have made more progress on installing mechanical systems. Stopping next on the fourth floor, we stepped out onto the roof deck. Residential units that face the fourth floor deck will each get their own private terrace.  Our next stop was the parking garage, which will have parking for 51 cars. The third floor includes space for a dog wash and dog run as a tenant amenity, while the second floor includes a bike room for 150 bikes. As an amenity-focused development, residents will also have access to meeting rooms, a fitness center, and a rooftop terrace with pool once the tower is completed.  Wrapping up the tour, we walked through the ground floor which will have 9,400 square feet of retail space flanking a center residential lobby. Currently, the construction hoist lands right where the entryway will be for residents.  With work progressing quickly, Skender expects to top out the tower later this month and enclose the entire building with glass by late Spring.

Permits issued for Medinah Temple temporary casino,"Building permits have been issued for the temporary casino at Medinah Temple planned by Bally’s Corporation. As part of their winning casino bid, Bally’s will be operating a temporary casino at Medinah Temple until the full-fledged casino is completed at the site of the current Tribune Freedom Center printing plant. With STL Architects on board for the conversion, the plan will renovate the interior while avoiding any building changes to the landmarked exterior. Originally built in 1912 by architects Huel and Schmid, the building was home to the Chicago Shriners and was designed in a Moorish style with extensive ornament that makes it a unique building amongst its surrounding context. Protected by landmark designation, the exterior will remain unchanged with the exception of new signs replacing the old signs. The current signage from Bloomingdale’s will be removed and replaced with Bally’s signage that matches the same configuration and scale.   On the interior, Bloomingdale’s conversion in 2003 saw the filling in of the original 4,200-seat auditorium to create larger floor plates for the store. Since the proscenium was also protected by the landmark status, it was retained and painted white. With SOSH Architects working on the interior, the casino plan will see the removal of most of the interior partitions to open up the floors to casino gaming. Any new walls and rooms on the top floor would be built below the original ceiling to keep the coffered ceilings intact. With permits issued for the construction, general contractor Gilbane Building Company can begin work to finish by Bally’s target of a Summer 2023 opening. Once open, it is planned to run for 24 months until the full casino site is opened to the public. ",River North

Rising 255 feet, the apartment mix will consist of 50 studios, 101 one-beds, and 17 two-beds. 51 car parking spaces will be included on the second and third floors, with bike parking provided for 150 bikes. Designed with a contemporary loft vernacular, the building will use floor-to-ceiling glass with a small amount of metal paneling. The front facade will have a subtle serrated edge stepping back from the street to allow for wider southern views. To offer relief on the ground floor for outdoor dining, the retail space will setback in line with the building’s setback.  Tenant amenities will include an interior dog run and dog spa, a fitness center, outdoor fitness space, a club room, coworking space, and an outdoor deck with a pool. The existing building at 755 N. Wells will be retained and used for retail and office space. To meet affordability requirements, the project will include five units on site at 60% AMI and a payment of $2.4 million in lieu of the remaining 13 units. VISTA Property financed the project with a first mortgage loan from Huntington Bank, and has also engaged Luxury Living Chicago Realty, downtown Chicago’s premier marketing, consulting and residential leasing brokerage firm. With Skender in charge of construction, completion is slated for 2024.   ",River North
City Council approves mixed-use development at 3318 W. Montrose,"The Chicago City Council has approved a mixed-use development at 3318 W. Montrose. Planned by Yuriy Chvyrenko, the development would occupy a vacant site at the northeast corner of the intersection of W. Montrose Ave and N. Christiana Ave. Designed by Hanna Architects, the new construction would consist of a four-story building. The ground floor would host 2,720 square feet of commercial space along W. Montrose Ave, with the residential entrance around the corner on N. Christiana Ave. During the aldermanic review process, the project has been revised to reduce the parking count from 24 spaces to 17 spaces and a new three-bedroom unit has been added to the ground floor along N. Christiana Ave. The upper three floors of the building would have the remaining 24 residential units, with five of them set aside as affordable. With eight apartments per floor, all of the rentals on these upper floors will be two bedroom layouts with private balconies and in-unit laundry.  Topping out at 65 feet tall, the building’s ground floor will be enclosed with dark gray brick and glass.

Neighbors express concern over height and parking at 4651 N. Kedzie,"Neighbors expressed concern over the height and lack of parking in a proposed mixed-use development at 4651 N. Kedzie that was recently presented to the local community. Located adjacent to the Kedzie CTA Brown Line station, the project site is a vacant parcel that shares its southern property line with the CTA tracks. The project is being developed by PNM Enterprises. Designed by a+c architects, the new construction would be a six-story mixed-use structure topping out at 65 feet tall. On the ground floor, approximately 4,630 square feet of retail space will occupy the majority of the floor plate. The residential entry along N. Kedzie Ave would include an office space, mail room, and bike storage. The building will have zero car parking spaces. With a total of 26 units planned, four one-beds and 20 two-beds will be located on the second through fifth floors, with six units per floor. The top floor will have two large three-bedroom units with outdoor spaces. Rents are estimated at $1,500/month for one-beds, $2,700/month for two-beds, and $3,900/month for the three-beds. Six of the units will be set aside as affordable housing at 60% AMI. To allow for the approximately $8 million development, the project will require a rezoning from B3-2 to B3-5, which will need approval from 33rd Ward Alderman Rossana Rodriguez. During the meeting many neighbors expressed concern about the height of the building, its lack of parking, and the high price point of the residential units planned.  If Alderman Rossana Rodriguez approves the project, the rezoning application will need to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.

The Workshop plans community-oriented performing arts center at 3741 W. Lawrence,"The Workshop is planning a community-oriented performing arts and gathering space at 3741 W. Lawrence. Located midblock, the property is currently occupied by a 100+-year-old building that would be renovated into the home of this new local hub. Designed by Future Firm, The Workshop will serve as a multifaceted hub for arts and culture. Nestled within the walls of a 100+ year-old building, the concept includes rehearsal studios, commercial space for local businesses such as a café and instrument repair shop, and flexible event and performance space. The building would be served by two car parking spaces and six bike parking spaces.  The Workshop aspires to be a catalyst for economic development, revitalizing a quiet stretch of Lawrence Avenue. The project demonstrates a commitment to equity by supporting BIPOC-led small businesses and arts nonprofits through affordable leases and tenant improvement funds, contributing to the enrichment and vibrancy of the local cultural landscape. The current zoning would limit the capacity of the space to 149 people; limit what kind of restaurant could be co-located for the gathering space and/or what kinds of refreshments could be served during performances; and would foreclose the possibility of incorporating complementary uses/businesses such as a recording studio. To allow for the scope of the project, the team is looking to rezone the property from B1-2 to C1-2. The $1.8 million project will be financed with a combination of City and philanthropic grants, personal equity, a seller note to help acquire the property, conventional debt for construction and permanent financing, potentially additional investor equity, and ideally an allocation of TIF. So far, the development has been awarded $400,000 in city grant funding from the Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Program and $100,000 from the Chicago Community Trust Predevelopment Program.

Ribbon cutting celebrated for Maria Elena Sifuentes Apartments,"The City of Chicago, Mayor Johnson, Chicago DOH, developer Celadon Partners, the Communities United housing team, and Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez gathered to celebrate the completion of the Maria Elena Sifuentes Apartments located at 3559 W. Lawrence in Albany Park. “Celadon is thrilled to have completed our latest affordable housing development in Chicago’s Albany Park community,” stated Scott Henry CEO of Celadon Partners, “Our mission of providing safe affordable housing options for families in this community was a collaborative effort between Celadon, our community partners ROOTS and Communities United, the City of Chicago Department of Buildings, and our lending partners Huntington Bank.” The Maria Elena Sifuentes Apartments, initially named the Metropolitan Apartments, was selected in the Department of Housing’s (DOH) 2019 funding round. With total development costs at $26.17 million, City assistance comprised 70% of the total project sources. DOH provided $1.6 million in 9% Low Income Housing Tax Credits, as well as $990,000 in Donation Tax Credits, resulting in approximately $15.8 million in total equity for the benefit of this project. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development further issued up to $2.5 million in Tax Increment Financing assistance. “Housing is a fundamental right, and the Maria Elena Sifuentes Apartments exemplify our commitment to ensuring that those who require subsidies to live affordably have just as many choices in where they call home as those who don’t require subsidies,” said Housing Commissioner Jim R. Horan. Designed by UrbanWorks, the newly completed project offers 50 units of affordable housing, with 42 units priced for households earning up to 60% of the Area Median Income and the remaining eight units at market rate. Additionally, 15 of the 42 units are made available to extremely low-income households, thanks to the crucial support of CLIHTF rental subsidies. In addition to providing affordable housing options to the community, the project will prioritize the needs of working families by providing access to a convenient, enriching, and accredited childcare option. Concordia Place – an award-winning, locally-based non-profit daycare provider for resident families and the surrounding community – will occupy the ground floor commercial space, which spans an impressive 6,500 square feet.

Affordable apartments in Albany Park take key steps forward,"In Albany Park, a plan to replace a longtime vacant lot with a 50-unit affordable housing development is closer to becoming a reality on the heels of two key city approvals. At February’s Zoning Board of Appeals meeting, the property at 3557 W. Lawrence Avenue received a variance for the proposed six-story building. And last week, the project got another boost when the city’s Community Development Commission voted to set aside $2.5 million in tax increment financing (TIF). Developed by Celadon Holdings, the roughly $16 million project—known as the Metropolitan Apartments—will create 42 new affordable rental units targeting families at 15 percent, 30 percent, and 60 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Eight apartments will be designed as “workforce” housing targeting families at 80 percent AMI. The new structure, designed by Chicago-based UrbanWorks, will rise to a height of 73 feet and offer exterior space for local artists to paint murals, according to Block Club Chicago. The transit-oriented project will take advantage of the site’s proximity to the CTA Brown Line and provide on-site parking for 13 cars and 50 bicycles. The plan also calls for the building’s first-floor retail space will be occupied by the nonprofit organization Concordia Place, which will provide free or low-cost childcare for residents. The TIF funding will still need to go before the Chicago City Council for final approval, and the developers must secure building permits before construction can begin.

Alderman Vasquez denies zoning change for proposal at 5400 N. Ashland,"Alderman Vasquez has announced that he will not support the zoning change requested for a proposed development at 5400 N. Ashland. Planned by real estate investor Josh Bradley, the project site is located at the northwest corner of N. Ashland Ave and W. Balmoral Ave. Owned for 30 years by the Gillis family, the site had a proposed 7-unit condo project that was rejected back in 2020. In 2021, the existing home on the site was purchased by someone who renovated the interior and resold it. Bradley and his husband bought the home and property in October 2022. Designed by Compass Architecture LLC, the new construction building would have been a five-story structure topping out at 57 feet tall. With 18 residential units in the building, 16 of them will be two-beds and two will be three-bed configurations. 14 of them would’ve been rented at market-rate, with the other four set aside as affordable. A parking garage at the back of the ground floor would include nine car parking spaces and nine bike parking spaces.  The building’s design includes a palette of materials that references the neighborhood and the Picasso sculpture downtown. The facade’s white brick portion relates to the adjacent building on W. Balmoral Ave, while the red brick corners relate to the building to the north of the site on N. Ashland Ave. The corten steel will clad the upper floors, bringing in something new and sharp into the material palette of the neighborhood. The development was planning to include green building features, such as green roofs with native plantings, LED light fixtures with timers and motion sensors, high efficiency HVAC and appliances, EV charging stations, composting, and the infrastructure for the building to be converted all-electric in the future. The developer was asking to rezone the site from RS-3 to B2-3, but Alderman Vasquez denied the change, citing neighbors' concern for its height and density, its design, and for not having enough affordable units in the building. Vasquez said in a statement that he will be having a follow up meeting with the community to discuss the lack of affordable housing in the area and encouraged the developer to meet with neighbors and address their concerns, encouraging a proposal that would be more aesthetically in line with the neighborhood and at least one floor shorter.

The development is planning to include green building features, such as green roofs with native plantings, LED light fixtures with timers and motion sensors, high efficiency HVAC and appliances, EV charging stations, composting, and the infrastructure for the building to be converted all-electric in the future. After the presentation, Bradley talked through different elements in the project that are under consideration and development. While the design currently has the garage access via a curb cut on W. Balmoral Ave, the architecture team is looking at switching access to the alley. The team is looking at removing the brick arches at the porches and offsetting the plane of the corten steel based on community feedback prior to the meeting. They are also looking to reduce the visibility of the rooftop stair and to make the building as sustainable as possible. Some neighbors were concerned about the parking count in the building, with nine spaces for the 14 units. The development team explained how the site is a transit-served location and falls within the TOD requirements, allowing for a reduction in parking. The team referenced statistics that households in TOD areas are twice as likely not to own a car and carless residents are more likely to frequent local businesses. Some neighbors expressed support for the reduced parking count. Some neighbors also took issue with the scale of the project, asking the development team if they could move forward with a three-story building. The development team responded that that would be a substantial deviation from the plan, and the proposal as it stands has a very specific proforma to make rentals with affordable units work. Going to three floors would damage this plan and would reduce the ability to include affordable units which they felt would be a mistake. Many neighbors expressed positive reactions to the proposed density. To allow for the scope of the development, the developers are looking to rezone the site from RS-3 to B2-3. Before heading to City Hall for approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council, Alderman Andre Vasquez of the 40th Ward will need to approve of the project. The developer reported that they currently plan to start construction at the end of 2024 or early 2025 with a 15-month construction timeline. ",Andersonville

Four-story residential project headed to Andersonville,"Construction is imminent on a 13-unit residential development at 1765 W. Rosehill Drive in the Andersonville neighborhood, according to a recent building permit issued to Chicago-based Candea Development. The four-story-plus-basement structure would rise just west of Candea's four-story, 39-unit condo development at 1743 W. Rosehill (also known as 5748 N. Hermitage). The development replaces a low-rise commercial site that previously housed Jeron Electronic Systems and a parking lot. Candea purchased the property for $2.6 million in 2017, RE Journals reported. Designed by Compass Architecture LLC , the upcoming 13-unit building features a masonry facade, an elevator, several large balconies, and a rooftop deck based on a rendering posted by Compass. It's unclear if the project at 1765 W. Rosehill Drive will be offered as rentals or condos. A for-sale product seems more likely given Candea's track record in the area and the fact that the development will include an attached 13-car garage. The permit lists Rainmaker Real Estate Holdings as the project's general contractor.

Construction completed for Greater Chicago Food Depository Expansion,"Construction has been completed on a 38,000-square-foot facility expansion for the Greater Chicago Food Depository, a nonprofit anti-hunger organization that provides food for families and individuals experiencing food insecurity and works in partnership with the community to end hunger across Chicago and Cook County. The new prepared meals center, located at 4100 W. Ann Lurie Place, was completed seven weeks ahead of schedule by general contractor Skender and has enabled the food bank to increase its response to hunger with capacity to distribute up to 10,000 scratch-made meals per day. “For 45 years, the Food Depository has been driven by a vision for a hunger free community,” said Kate Maehr, Executive Director and CEO of the Food Depository. “With our new prepared meals center we have dramatically increased our capacity to offer nourishing, ready to eat meals for our neighbors at greatest risk of food insecurity. This accelerates our mission to end hunger.” Designed by Partners by Design as architect, the expansion added a commercial kitchen for meal preparation, cold storage spaces to support the food preparation areas, a new lobby and 11.5 acres of site work with ample parking for volunteers and guests.  Skender coordinated and facilitated the installation of a singular Hydroponic Container Farming Unit, which enables the Food Depository to grow its own fresh herbs for prepared meals. Now fully operational, the new facility is being used to create and distribute healthy prepared meals for older adults, people living with disabilities and other neighbors facing food insecurity.   “The Greater Chicago Food Depository is a pillar of our community, and it’s been an honor to help them expand and serve more people than ever before,” said Eric Fiket, Senior Project Manager and Team Leader at Skender.

Sterling Bay closes on industrial site at 4510 W. Ann Lurie,"Sterling Bay has announced its successful closing on the purchase of 4510 W Ann Lurie Place, a 7.5-acre land parcel in Chicago’s Archer Heights neighborhood. The acquisition was made in partnership with Affinius Capital, with a construction loan from First National Bank of Omaha. The firm plans to develop a 147,500 square foot industrial facility on site to meet the city’s increasing demand for modern industrial space. This project further solidifies the company’s commitment to expanding its portfolio into new verticals outside of creative office, including industrial, life sciences and residential. The development at 4510 W Ann Lurie Place will be constructed by PREMIER Design + Build Group, featuring ten loading bays, two drive-in doors, and 101 vehicles parking spaces. Notably, the LEED Silver-certified facility will support sustainable operations, with EV charging stations to promote eco-friendly transit, upgraded steel components for future solar panel integration, and native landscaping to enhance the exterior environment. “This project reflects our unwavering belief in the power of real estate development to contribute to the betterment of our city,” said Andy Gloor, CEO at Sterling Bay. “By prioritizing strategic urban planning, innovative design, and sustainable practices, like we’ve done here at 4510 W Ann Lurie Place, we aim to develop spaces that foster economic growth, create job opportunities, and enhance community resilience across Chicago.” 4510 W Ann Lurie Place is set to break ground later this year, creating upwards of 35 full-time jobs once fully occupied. As part of its commitment to engaging local minority and women-owned businesses across its portfolio, Sterling Bay has committed to adhere to the city of Chicago’s MWBE Program at 4510 W Ann Lurie Place, which sets goals for MWBE participation at twenty-six percent and six percent, respectively.

Skender begins work on Greater Chicago Food Depository expansion,"Skender has commenced construction on a 37,000 square-foot expansion of the Greater Chicago Food Depository. Located at 4100 W. Ann Lurie, the non-profit organization provides food for families and individuals at risk of food insecurity while advancing a mission to end hunger.  To aid in the Food Depository’s goal to produce and distribute 2.5 million prepared meals annually to community members, the new structure will expand the light industrial facility to include a commercial kitchen for meal preparation and packaging, and a demonstration kitchen for nutrition education. With architects Partners by Design in charge of the design, the project also includes 11.5 acres of site work with parking for volunteers, guests and fleet, as well as space for growing fresh produce in the future. “The Greater Chicago Food Depository is excited to move forward with Skender on this transformational project,” said Kate Maehr, Executive Director and CEO of the Food Depository. “This expansion of our facility will directly result in more healthy prepared meals for our neighbors at increased risk of hunger, including older adults, people with disabilities, individuals with medical conditions, and other households. We look forward to the day the first meals are produced in our new commercial kitchen and delivered to households across our community. This is a vital step in our mission to end hunger.” In 2019, the organization completed an initial phase of upgrades, which expanded cold storage, upgraded the existing warehouse, and created new and renovated spaces for their volunteer program. The first phase renovations have been essential throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as demand for food assistance soared to record levels. As the need for prepared meals is projected to increase dramatically, this latest expansion will allow the Food Depository to reach target populations who have experienced unique barriers to food access during the pandemic, now and in the future. The new phase will also include a community partnership strategy that aims to increase the total number of healthy meals distributed by purchasing meals from local minority and women-owned businesses and community organizations. Driven by a $75 million capital campaign, construction of the new facility is expected to reach completion in early 2024. ",Archer Heights
City Council approves Greater Chicago Food Depository expansion,"The City Council has approved plans to expand the existing Greater Chicago Food Depository building at 4100 W. Ann Lurie Pl. Located in Archer Heights, the existing facility sits on an 880,00 square-foot site that spans from W. 40th St down to W. Ann Lurie Pl. along S. Keeler Ave. As part of the project, the organization will acquire the parking lot across the street and vacate S. Keeler Ave.  As a non-profit organization fighting hunger since 1978, the Greater Chicago Food Depository has been headquartered at the location since 2004. The current 268,000 square-foot building holds administration space, volunteer programming space, training areas, a warehouse, and a distribution space. Currently the facility needs more cold storage capacity and increased meal prep space. With Partners by Design as the architect behind the project, the new expansion and addition will add 36,700 square feet of space that will create a new meal prep facility as well as a new lobby and administrative space. The new facade will be made up mostly of precast concrete panels, while the new entry will be clad with a glass curtain wall. Panelized wood cladding with backlit signage for the organization will help to announce the new entry point. As part of the project, the newly expanded site will allow for 224 new parking spaces, bringing the total car parking spaces to 337 spots. S. Keeler Ave is vacated but will become an inner roadway for truck traffic that comes off of W. 40th St. Site detention spaces will be located at the northwest and south ends of the site, while an open green space will be left for a potential urban farm envisioned for the future.   With City Council approval, the development has now received a full greenlight from the city and can proceed with work on-site. According to a recent Chicago Sun-Times article, the facility is planning to be fully operational by late 2023. ",Archer Heights
The Chicago architectural legacy of the late great Helmut Jahn,"On Sunday, Chicago and the world lost one of its architectural greats. Helmut Jahn, a titan of postmodern design and larger-than-life personality, was tragically killed Saturday in a cycling crash near suburban St. Charles. The architect was 81 years old. It's impossible to tell Helmut Jahn's story without Chicago. Born in Germany in 1940, Helmut Jahn graduated from the Technische Hochschule in Munich and emigrated to the Windy City in 1966 to attend the Illinois Institute of Technology. Although he never graduated, Jahn did return to IIT in 2003 to design a dormitory building on the school's near south side campus.  Helmut joined Chicago architecture firm C. F. Murphy and Associates in 1967 and rose to the position of executive vice president and director of planning and design. Jahn took over the company in 1981 and renamed it Murphy/Jahn. The firm, which maintains offices in the Loop's historic Jewelers Building, was rebranded as simply JAHN in 2012. The company also has offices in Shanghai and Berlin. In the 1970s, Jahn joined up with the architectural ""Chicago Seven,"" a countercultural cohort of local designers that rejected the rigid monotony of the International Style pioneered by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and others. Although Jahn embraced the out-of-the-box attitude of his iconoclastic colleagues like Stanley Tigerman, Laurence Booth, and Thomas Beeby, his work could still trace its roots back to his old teacher and his uniquely Chicago brand of Modernism. ""Helmut was this dashing star of an architect,"" former Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin recently told the newspaper. ""He was on the cover of GQ. He was renowned as much for his persona as for his architecture, but his architecture was always exceptional. And, as time went on, he was regarded as less of a 'Flash Gordon' character and more of a modernist master."" Jahn went on to leave his mark on cities across the globe and reshaped New York's skyline in the process. In Chicago, Jahn continued to showcase his versatility. He teamed up with architect Gene Summers to create the boxy low-slung, Mies van der Rohe-esque Lakeside Center at McCormick Place as well as the glassy domelike Joe and Rika Mansueto Library at the University of Chicago. For international visitors, a first—and in many cases only—experience of Chicago occurs at O'Hare International Airport. Here, Jahn created an iconic mirrored neon-lined tunnel connecting the two concourses of the United Terminal. A Blue Line station with undulating glass-block walls backed by multicolor lighting serves as the airport's mass transit gateway. Even the concourse itself playfully evokes both the glass-topped train sheds of Victorian Europe and the inside of an airplane's wing, supported by rib-like structural spars.  Architecture critic Paul Goldberger tweeted, ""Shocked and saddened by the sudden death of Helmut Jahn, who was a pivotal figure in the evolution of Chicago modernism in the second half of the 20th century. His United terminal at O’Hare remains among the great airport buildings."" Jahn's biggest impact on the Chicago skyline—an 800-plus-foot residential tower called 1000M—remains a work in progress. The developers of the high-rise slated for 1000 S. Michigan Avenue were forced to pause foundation work during the pandemic, but they hope to soon restart construction by switching its condominium residences to easier-to-finance rental units.   ""I am extremely saddened by the loss of Helmut Jahn who I have had the privilege of working with for the last 15 years on multiple projects,"" said Francis Greenburger in a statement to Urbanize Chicago on behalf of the development team for 1000 S. Michigan. ""He was clearly one of the great architects of his time and has left his imprint and legacy around the world. My heartfelt sympathies and condolences to his wife and family. He will be greatly missed but we look forward to carrying his legacy forward with the completion of 1000M."" Jahn's hometown is also home to undoubtedly the biggest cliffhanger looming over the architect's impressive body of work: the fate of Chicago's threatened James R. Thompson Center. Completed in 1985 as the State of Illinois Building, the city block-sized structure was an audacious vision of what a government building could look like.  Resembling a salmon and baby blue-hued spaceship that touched down in the heart of the Loop, the James R. Thompson Center was always going to be a controversial building. The site's 17-story atrium evokes the grand gestures of traditional public spaces like 19th-century train stations.... or is a giant and inefficient waste of space, depending on who you ask.   Stuck in an architectural no man's land between being too new to be considered ""classic"" and too dated to appeal to contemporary tastes, postmodernism buildings like the Thompson Center don't make an easy case for preservation. An estimated $300 million deferred maintenance bill certainly doesn't do the JRTC any favors either. Last month, the State of Illinois officially put the building up for sale. A city ordinance to rezone the site at 100 W. Randolph to allow for the construction of a skyscraper as high as 100 stories is working its way through the City Council. Will Helmut's unfortunate passing help efforts to save this unusual albeit neglected masterpiece? Only time will tell, but it's looking like a long shot. If there is a silver lining to this weekend's tragedy, it may be that Helmut Jahn won't be present to witness the Thompson Center's demise. Rest in peace, Helmut Jahn. ",Architecture

CDC approves $15 million in TIF for 838 W. 79th  ,"The Community Development Commission has approved $15 million in TIF financing for a mixed-use development planned for 79th St in Auburn Gresham. Planned by Imagine Group and Evergreen Real Estate Group, the proposal was the winning bid of the Auburn Gresham Invest South/West RFP. Originally one site at 838 W 79th St, the project has evolved and expanded to include another city-owned site at 757 W 79th St.  With Ross Barney Architects leading the design, the project has undergone many changes as a result of feedback from the community. In its final iteration, the building at the original site of 838 W 79th St will stand three floors holding 28 units and 28 parking spaces. The ground floor will also offer ground floor retail space to bring retailers to this area and create jobs.  At 757 W 79th St, the newly proposed four-story building will hold 30 residential units and offer ground floor commercial space. All of the residential apartments in both buildings will be designated as affordable at up to 60% AMI.  As reported by the city planning department, the city-owned land at 838 W 79th St has been vacant for over 20 years and 757 W 79th St has been vacant since the city performed an emergency demolition in 2012.  The $40 million project is being financed through numerous streams including $17 million in LIHTC equity, $15 million in TIF, $1 million in a mortgage, $3 million from the State of Illinois DCEO, as well as other sources. The city will be performing a land write down to $1 per parcel on land valued at $184,000. As part of this approval, the city will enter into a land sale agreement and designate Evergreen Real Estate Group and Imagine Group as developers of this site. This approval from the Community Development Commission will now need a final stamp of approval from City Council. Construction is expected to begin later in 2022 with a completion target for 2023.

Auburn Gresham Metra station takes key step forward,"After years of planning—and funding-related delays—the Auburn Park Metra station is one step closer to becoming a reality in the Auburn Gresham community on Chicago's South Side.  This week, Metra's board of directors awarded a $28.2 million construction contract to John Burns Construction. The new station has been under discussion since at least 2009. Local officials joined Metra for a groundbreaking ceremony in 2019, but actual work has yet to begin. The transit agency put the project out to bid in May. The upcoming station will be located southeast corner of 79th Street and Lowe Avenue and service Metra's Rock Island Line. The site plan calls for a landscaped plaza with bicycle racks and benches, an 80-space parking lot, and an elevated platform accessed by stairs and elevators. Metra tapped T.Y. Lin International to design the facility.  The project will restore commuter rail service to the area around 79th Street, which has been without a station since the Rock Island Railroad closed in 1978 and was absorbed by the Regional Transit Agency (RTA). Preliminary work on the station will begin this fall and ramp-up in early 2022. The transit improvement is also a short walk from the planned Auburn Gardens mixed-use affordable housing development—part of the city's INVEST South/West initiative aimed at revitalizing commercial corridors in historically underserved neighborhoods.  ",Auburn Gresham
City selects team for mixed-use affordable development in Auburn Gresham,"A team has been selected to revitalize a vacant tract of land in Auburn Gresham on Chicago’s South Side. The estimated $19.4 million project, which is part of the city’s innovative INVEST South/West initiative, will create a new five-story building with approximately 56 units of affordable housing near the intersection of Halsted and 79th streets. Known as Auburn Gardens, the development comes from Evergreen Imagine JV LLC, which consists of developers Evergreen Real Estate Group and Imagine Group and the design firms of Carol Ross Barney and NIA Architecture.  Like all INVEST South/West winners so far, Auburn Gardens will be mixed-use. It is targeting a restaurant and an athletic goods retailer for its ground-floor retail space. “Projects on major commercial corridors form the heart of a neighborhood,” said David Block, director of development with Evergreen. “Just building housing isn’t enough. You need to invest time, energy, and money into revitalizing these corridors.”  Block says that he sees Evergreen’s Auburn Gresham project replicating the same kind of success the company experienced with its recent Independence Apartments and Northtown Apartments which “co-located” affordable housing atop new Chicago Public Library branches.  “You bring activity to the street level and it's reinforced by the people living upstairs,” said Block. “Chicago originally developed that way, with the ‘living above the store’ model, and we think there’s still some wisdom in that.” The project at 838 W. 79th Street will likely use some of the more conventional tools for financing affordable housing such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits and funding from the area’s existing tax increment financing (TIF) district.  Other projects included in the first round of INVEST South/West were a community ‘eco-food hub’ in Englewood and the adaptive reuse and expansion of Austin’s former Laramie Bank building into 72 units of mixed-income housing and a blues museum. Block expects Auburn Gardens to likely be the first project rolled out since its layout is less complicated compared to the other winners. “There’s a fair amount of pressure on us to deliver,” he said.  ",Auburn Gresham
Final landmark recommendation approved for Kingdom Baptist Church,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the Kingdom Baptist Church. Located at 301 N. Central, the church is situated at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Central Ave. Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city heritage, the church was built as the 15th Church of Christ Scientist over a series of three phases commenced in 1926 and completed 17 years later in 1943 by architect Nelson Max Dunning.  In 1972, the origins of Kingdom Baptist Church began as a small group met in the home of Pastor James a Horton. As a pastor at Greater Union Baptist Church, he left after a divide in the congregation and originated Kingdom Baptist Church. They purchased the 15th Church of Christ Scientist building and held the first service there in 1973. Also meeting Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture, the building’s design highlights the evolution of architectural styles over its construction including neoclassical and art deco elements. The front facade faces west and is defined by a monumental portico with a series of short steps to raise it above grade. Limestone columns with Corinthian columns support the limestone entablature.  By 1931, the design was streamlined, and elements of the original neoclassical design were eliminated. Roofline ornament was removed and replaced with a more linear design popular in the art deco style. The south facade facing W. Fulton St is dominated by three story limestone arcade frames with arched windows that light the auditorium. The arches are joined by an elongated keystone. Adjacent to the arcade frames is a projecting vestibule with arched entrances. The facade setbacks above it with punched window openings.  Lastly, the building meets Criterion 5 as a work of a significant architect. Nelson Max Dunning was born in Wisconsin and worked in Chicago, becoming known for his specialization in large scale industrial, commercial, and educational buildings. One of his most notable works is the American Book Company Building 1912 at 330 E Cermak, with others including the American Furniture Mart at 680 N. Lake Shore and the 14th Church of Christ Scientist at 4444 N Paulina. With excellent integrity on its exterior, the building also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. The church retains its historic location, environment, materials, and workmanship. Few alterations have been made, limited to the replacement of some of the roof surfaces, replacement of windows on the east end of the south and east facades, the installation of a chairlift and ramp, and the addition of a fence along the site’s perimeter. As proposed, the significant features to be protected would be all exterior elevations including rooflines. With the final landmark recommendation secured, the proposed designation will be sent to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. ",Austin
Mars Candy Factory is officially a Chicago landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved a landmark designation for the Mars Candy Factory in Austin. Located at 2019 N. Oak Park, the factory was originally built in 1929 by The Austin Company with a contributing addition from 1960 by C.F. Murphy Associates. Meeting Criterion 1 for heritage, the factory benefitted from Chicago’s status as the center of the country’s railroad network. Set up next to the railroad tracks, train cars could be diverted via spurs to bring fresh goods onto the site. When the factory was built, only scattered parcels around it were developed, but the facility became an asset to the neighborhood and workers chose to live in the area. The building has been the headquarters and main production facility for decades, with the factory producing some of the nation’s most popular candy for almost a century, starting with the Milky Way. At its busiest, the facility had 10 production lines and 2500 people employed. The facility also meets Criterion 3 for its association with a significant person. Frank C. Mars founded the company in 1911, and the factory was a result of his desire to build the most beautiful candy factory in America. Forrest Mars Sr, Frank's son, worked with him in the early 1930s and helped to create Snickers, Three Musketeers, and M&M’s.   Also meeting Criterion 4, the factory is constructed in the Spanish Revival style, reflected in the distinctive low pitch clay tile roofs, compound hipped and gable roofs of varying heights, and arched window and door openings. The central tower with pyramidal roof is the primary one, but small tower shapes extend above the north elevation roofline as well as above the roofline of the north wing.  The final criteria is Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect. The original part was built by the Austin Company, which was founded in 1878. Globally known as the innovator in industrial facility design and construction, it was the one of the earliest companies to offer the whole suite of design, engineering, and construction services in one entity, eliminating high cost. The 1960 addition was designed by C.F. Murphy Associates, one of Chicago’s most prominent mid-20th century architects.  Although the factory has had dozens of additions over the years, the factory still meets the Integrity Criterion because the additions have been built on the rear and have not had a significant impact on the historical and architectural features. Alterations to the historic portion include the replacement of windows and doors as well as the clay roof tiles.  The significant features of the factory that will be protected are all exterior elevations including rooflines measuring back seven bays from the facade at a depth of approximately 133 feet, stretching from the north elevation down to the south elevation along W. Armitage Ave. The iron gate and brick posts will also be considered significant. ",Austin

Austin HOPE Center breaks ground,"Lurie Children’s Hospital and Stone Community Development Corporation recently celebrated the groundbreaking of the Austin HOPE Center at 5044 W. Chicago. Planned for a vacant site at the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Lawler Ave, the new facility will be a welcoming space for youth and families to seek community-based services and pediatric clinical and behavioral health care.  As the anchor tenant, Lurie Children’s will offer a range of pediatric clinical services including behavioral health, asthma and lung care, adolescent medicine, substance use treatment, heart disease prevention, weight management and wellness, and treatment for sickle cell disease, kidney disease, and autism. These services will help close gaps in currently existing healthcare services in the area and were carefully selected through extensive community engagement, including with local pediatric providers, and analysis of Lurie Children’s patient data. In addition to its clinical services, Lurie Children’s will also house evidence-based community health programs focused on food access, violence prevention, and early childhood support for new parents. They will also offer workforce development, research and volunteering opportunities. The new building will also house Thresholds’ West Side community-based outreach teams. Thresholds is one of the oldest and largest providers of recovery services for people with mental illnesses and substance use disorders in Illinois. Designed by Gregory Ramon Design Studio and TnS Studio, the new three-story structure will have approximately 25,000 square feet of space. Topping out at 55 feet, the building’s design consists of a colorful facade made of fiber cement paneling and brick. The site will include 15 parking spaces for visitors and employees. With UJAMAA Construction leading the construction of the new project, completion is targeted for Fall 2025. ",Austin
Mildred Wiley Wellness Hub secures $2.5 million grant,"The Mildred Wiley Wellness Hub was awarded $2.5 million in funding as a recipient of a Community Development Grant. Planned by Bethel New Life, the development will transform a portion of their campus in Austin located at 4950 W. Thomas.  Designed by WJW Architects, the project will create a holistic health and education center for residents of Austin and neighboring communities. The Horticenter and sunroom components, led by Bethel New Life, will serve as a community garden, educational center and gathering space, while the new 10,000 square foot health center will expand ACCESS’ physical and behavioral health services for the community. With Austin being the largest community area in Chicago by land area with the second largest population, investment in the health and well-being of its residents is just as important as its economic vitality. In Austin, higher poverty rates, racial health disparities, and limited access to care providers all contribute to community health outcomes that are consistently poorer than national benchmarks. The MWWH will expand health care services (including behavioral health), increase access to healthy food, and provide job training and support for entrepreneurs. The project’s kitchen will also be used to teach pathways to culinary careers for youth and adults and be available for rental by local food entrepreneurs. The exterior will include a community garden with 13 raised planters for growing vegetables to be used by campus residents as well as a variety of socialization and gathering spaces for community events and educational programming. The Horticenter will also include a ground floor patio and rooftop terrace. The sunroom will provide dedicated utility space for the over 200 senior residents on campus, allowing the distribution of produce and other nutritional activities from the garden and provides a welcoming connection between the residences on campus and the new Horticenter. The total estimated cost of the project is $5.4 million. Bethel New Life has already secured a $200,000 Austin Fresh grant, designed to improve access to fresh food in the Austin community. In addition, there is a $750,000 Community Project Funding request included in the proposed Federal funding bill at the direction of Congressman Danny Davis. The receipt of the $2.5 million in Community Development Grant funding will help get the project closer to full funding. ",Austin

CTA awards contract for Austin Green Line improvements,"The Chicago Transit Authority will soon begin a major renovation of the Austin Green Line station, including the addition of an elevator and other improvements to make the station fully accessible to those who use mobility devices as part of the CTA’s All Stations Accessibility Program (ASAP). The Chicago Transit Board recently approved the awarding of a contract not to exceed $15.3 million to John Burns Construction Company, LLC following a competitive procurement process. Funding for this critical infrastructure project was sourced through the federal government’s Surface Transportation Program (STP) and Governor Pritzker’s Rebuild Illinois Capital Plan.  STP funds provided $20.3M in funding and Rebuild Illinois provided $5.3M to this project for a total budget of $25.6M. “The CTA has made it a priority to collaborate with the disability community to pursue a vision of 100% accessibility for all customers,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr., “Awarding this contract for the Austin Green Line, we are able to take another step forward to realize the goal of making all stations 100% accessible, while also seeking opportunities to invest in the Austin community on our city’s West Side.   The original street level station opened in 1899 and has not been upgraded since it was rebuilt in 1962. The work at the Austin Green Line station will include fully reconstructing the main station house at 351 N. Austin Blvd, which upon completion will feature a new elevator and escalator that connects the station house to the platform above, in addition to a new ADA accessible ramp, new stairs and a platform extension. Details regarding the timeline of project work, including start and completion dates, will be announced at a later date. Under the leadership of CTA President Carter, the ASAP Strategic Plan was released in 2018, which serves as a blueprint for making all rail stations fully accessible by 2038. Currently 103 of CTA’s 145 rail stations (70%) are ADA accessible. With this announcement, 14 stations are currently funded and in various stages of planning and design or under construction.

City breaks ground on Aspire Center,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined Alderman Chris Taliaferro, Department of Planning and Development (DPD) Commissioner Maurice Cox, and representatives from Austin Coming Together (ACT), West Side Health Authority, BMO, and United Way of Metro Chicago for a groundbreaking ceremony for the Aspire Center in Austin. The $40.9M Invest South/West project is being led by Westside Health Authority, Austin Coming Together, and the Jane Addams Resource Corp., and it is supported by $12.25M in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) assistance approved by City Council last month. The Aspire Center will be housed in the former Robert Emmet Elementary School, a 69,100-square-foot building at 5500 W. Madison Ave., which closed in 2013.   “When I first took office as Mayor, I made a commitment to Chicago residents that my administration would direct City resources back into neighborhoods that had been overlooked for decades,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “My INVEST South/West initiative was born out of that commitment, and today’s groundbreaking is the latest example of how my team has executed that vision. The programs and services that the Aspire Center offers will unlock countless career opportunities for Austin residents and support local entrepreneurs who want to create new businesses or expand existing businesses in this community. I look forward to seeing the day that Austin’s potential is fully realized, and I know that the Aspire Center’s presence here will hasten the arrival of that day.”   With Lamar Johnson Collaborative serving as the architect, the Aspire Center will be a multi-use facility that includes an advanced manufacturing training center, small business incubator, community hub, and event space. Specific on-site services are planned to include job readiness and vocational training, financial coaching, and employment services. The project is anticipated to create 50 permanent jobs and train more than 2,000 workers over the next five years. In December 2022, the West Side Health Authority’s POPFit! community plaza opened on a portion of the three-acre property shared by the Aspire Center through a $500,000 DPD Chicago Recovery Plan grant. The Aspire Center was selected to receive city support through the Department of Planning and Development’s (DPD) Community Development Grant program. Austin Coming Together will operate a walk-in community hub in the new center to provide resources to anyone in need. Darrel Hackett, President, BMO Wealth Management-U.S., joined Mayor Lightfoot at the groundbreaking to celebrate the bank’s partnership with the city in supporting INVEST South/West projects. In addition to city support through the allocation of TIF funds, State Representative La Shawn K. Ford worked to secure $10M in state funds for the Aspire Center when the project was in its early stages.   Initial construction on the future Aspire Center is currently underway and the project is expected to reach completion in late 2024.   ",Austin
Full building permit issued for 5200 W. Chicago,"Austin United Alliance has received a full building permit for the new residential building at 5200 W. Chicago. Planned by Heartland Housing Alliance and Oak Park Regional Housing Center, the project won the Austin Invest South/West RFP issued by the city. With Valerio Dewalt Train Associates in charge of the residential building, the L-shaped design will rise six floors, directly west of the Laramie State Bank. Matching the height and width of the bank’s frontage on its western end of the L-shaped massing, the building will be accented with white frame elements overlooking W. Chicago Ave. At the ground floor, a conference room will face the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Latrobe Ave, while a community room will face out onto the outdoor courtyard space. Between the two, the residential entry will front W. Chicago Ave. An indoor bike room for 43 bikes will have a direct entry from the exterior along N. Latrobe Ave. The rest of the ground floor will hold 28 parking spaces under the northern wing of the building. Rising 80 feet tall, the mixed-income building will host a total of 78 units, split into 51 affordable units and 27 market-rate units. With a split of 37 one-beds, 36 two-beds, and 5 three-beds, 3 one-beds and 3 two-beds will be priced up to 50% AMI, with 21 on-beds, 20 two-beds, and 4 three-beds priced up to 60% AMI. With the outdoor space programmed as a public courtyard, the project will use a series of swinging gates to give access to the public while closing it off overnight. Local artists will be recruited to design the gates and a mural on the wall of the Laramie State Bank building. With the $45 million project split into two phases, this full building permit will allow the construction of only the residential building. With permits in hand, general contractor Bowa Construction can get work started. Restoration of the Laramie State Bank building is planned for 2023 through 2025.  ",Austin
5200 W. Chicago breaks ground,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot joined city leaders, local community, philanthropic, and corporate partners to commemorate the three-year anniversary of INVEST South/West by breaking ground on Austin United Alliance, a new mixed-use development at 5200 W. Chicago. Planned by Heartland Housing Alliance and Oak Park Regional Housing Center, the project won the Austin Invest South/West RFP issued by the city. The $47 million development will see the construction of a six-story, 78 unit mixed-income building designed by Valerio Dewalt Train Associates. Sited adjacent to the historic Laramie State Bank Building, the bank will see an overhaul and restoration led by Latent Design and Bauer Latoza Studio. The design calls for a new bank branch, cafe, Blues Museum, and office/coworking space. With construction imminent, completion is targeted for 2024. ""Thanks to the $2.2 billion in investment commitments from the public and private sectors since the fall of 2019, INVEST South/West is ready to expand its reach beyond retail districts to include nearby residential blocks that are vital to sustainable neighborhood growth,"" said Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot. ""We will soon say goodbye to the pervasive vacant lots across the South and West Sides and say hello to new two-flats, three-flats, and other walk-up structures that have been home to Chicago families for generations. As I look forward to this next phase in INVEST South/West, I am grateful for the Citywide collaboration and commitment that has already brought incredible transformations to our communities.""  As part of the event, Lightfoot announced new initiatives within Invest South/West that will expand the focus from commercial corridor investments to smaller infill developments on the approximately 5,600 city-owned vacant lots within the neighborhoods. Dubbed Come Home, the first will support the construction of single-family homes, townhouses and small multi-unit buildings on residential blocks within Auburn Gresham, Bronzeville, East Garfield Park, Englewood, Humboldt Park, and Woodlawn. This will launch in late November 2022 with a nationwide Chicago Architecture Center contest that establishes modern design typologies to be built by emerging development firms and made available for affordable home buyers.   The next initiative, called Ready Build, will make concept plans available for corner lot redevelopments with ground floor stores and apartments above. These packages will include concept architectural drawings, cost estimates, and other pre-development materials to help emerging, minority-led development firms get new projects off the ground in the South and west side neighborhoods.  The final offering, BlockBuilder, will serve as an online portal that streamlines the sale of surplus City of Chicago properties to private buyers. More than 80% of the 2,000 vacant lots to initially be made available through the portal’s launch this year are located within INVEST South/West communities.   In addition to the public and private investment, CDOT is spending roughly $280 million in streetscape improvements within the Invest South/West corridors. Encompassing 20 miles of arterial streets, the projects will include infrastructure, pedestrian safety, and placemaking improvements. Construction on the Austin streetscape along W. Chicago Ave is expected to be completed in phases with full completion expected by the end of 2025. ",Austin
CDC approves TIF for Aspire Center,"The Community Development Commission has approved $7.25 million in TIF funding for the proposed Aspire Center. Located at 5500 W. Madison, the project looks to reuse the former Robert Emmet Public School that stands at the corner of W. Madison St and N. Central Ave. Developed by Austin Coming Together and Westside Health Authority, the now-vacant school was closed in 2015 and was purchased from Chicago Public Schools in 2018. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, The Aspire Center for Workforce Innovation will renovate the school, restoring the existing classrooms into functional spaces that meet current workforce development and training needs – from advanced manufacturing to small business incubation. The 76,500 square-foot project will see the construction of a new three-story addition that will become the new entry to the building, with a restaurant and bank also planned for the project.

City Council approves 5200 W. Chicago,"Austin United Alliance has received approval from the Chicago City Council for the development at 5200 W. Chicago. Planned by Heartland Housing Alliance and Oak Park Regional Housing Center, the project won the Austin Invest South/West RFP issued by the city. With Valerio Dewalt Train Associates in charge of the residential portion of the development, a new six-story residential building is planned for the vacant portion of the block, directly west of Laramie State Bank. The frontage of the L-shaped building’s south wing matches the height and width of the bank’s frontage. White frame elements will accent the top of the northern wing of the building and the Chicago Ave frontage. At the ground floor, a conference room will face the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Latrobe Ave, while a community room will face out onto the outdoor courtyard space. Between the two, the residential entry will front W. Chicago Ave. An indoor bike room for 43 bikes will have a direct entry from the exterior along N. Latrobe Ave. The rest of the ground floor will hold 28 parking spaces under the northern wing of the building. Rising 80 feet tall, the mixed-income building will host a total of 78 units, split into 51 affordable units and 27 market-rate units. With a split of 37 one-beds, 36 two-beds, and 5 three-beds, 3 one-beds and 3 two-beds will be priced up to 50% AMI, with 21 on-beds, 20 two-beds, and 4 three-beds priced up to 60% AMI. With the outdoor space programmed as a public courtyard, the project will use a series of swinging gates to give access to the public while closing it off overnight. Local artists will be recruited to design the gates and a mural on the wall of the Laramie State Bank building. The historic Laramie State Bank Building will be restored and reopened to the public with a new bank, cafe, Blues Museum, and office/coworking space. Led by Latent Design and Bauer Latoza Studio, the new design will redevelop the interior of the main banking hall and upper floors. Currently in the state of an architectural ruin, the main lobby space will have a restored coffered ceiling while the exterior terracotta will be refurbished, and new windows will be installed. The developers have already received interest from two different national banks for new space inside the renovated structure. The $45 million project will be built in two phases, splitting up the residential development from the bank restoration. Work is expected to begin on the residential building in November 2022, with restoration of the Laramie State Bank building planned for 2023 through 2025.  ",Austin

Landmarks approves rehab at 5200 W. Chicago,"The Permit Review Committee has approved plans for the rehabilitation of the Laramie State Bank Building at 5200 W. Chicago. Planned as part of the Austin United Alliance proposal that won the Austin Invest South/West RFP, the building will be renovated and restored as part of the development. The development is being led by Heartland Housing Alliance and Oak Park Regional Housing Center. As reviewed by the landmarks division, the historic Laramie State Bank Building will be restored and reopened to the public with a new bank, cafe, Blues Museum, and office/coworking space. Led by Latent Design, the new design will redevelop the interior of the main banking hall and upper floors. Currently in the state of an architectural ruin, the main lobby space will have a restored coffered ceiling under which the new programs of cafe, Blues Museum exhibit, and a new bank branch will be housed. With Bauer Latoza Studio on the team leading the restoration effort, the building will see many exterior repairs as well. Currently, the exterior terracotta is in poor condition and is serelt cracked with many missing sections. The restoration will refurbish the existing terracotta and replace any pieces that cannot be retained. Existing windows will be replaced with new ones that will match the profile of the current windows. Designed by Valerio Dewalt Train Associates, the overall development will produce a six-story residential building. Rising 69 feet, the structure will hold 76 residential units, 30 vehicle parking spaces, 55 bike stalls, and various tenant amenities. The apartment mix includes 36 one-bedrooms, 35 two-bedrooms, and five three-bedroom rentals. Amenities include an outdoor rooftop deck, fitness room, computer room, social space on each floor and a community room on the ground floor intended for events and social gatherings. The design of the proposal looks to refer to the historic bank building in its design while suggesting a new future of development and activity for the neighborhood. The team is looking to create a catalyst for the neighborhood that sparks innovation, activates the area with a pedestrian-focused scale, and prioritizes the local community including through the establishment of a community-based non-profit board that will manage the reused bank building.  The new construction and former bank building will create a U-shape on the site, leaving the center middle portion open for a public plaza and green space. The plaza will be the fabric that connects new and old together and to the public. Pavings will extend into the sidewalk to welcome the public, while rotating screens will close off at night for residential access only. Public art will be featured on the screened gates as well as on the large blank wall of the bank building. The exterior space will offer green lawn spaces and plantings as well as seating opportunities and small areas to gather.  With this approval from the Permit Review Committee, the project team has the clearance from this division as part of their approval process. The development will go before the Community Development Commission this week to approve the land sale to the developer. Later this week, the project will also go before the Chicago Plan Commission before heading to the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. A timeline for construction has not been formally announced. ",Austin
Seth Warner House landmarking sent to City Council,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation to the City Council for the Seth Warner House. Located at 631 N. Central Avenue, the home was originally constructed in 1869 for successful businessman Seth Warner who was one of the earliest settlers in Chicago. Active abolitionist and music patron, Mr. Warner owned a downtown music hall that was often home to anti-slavery events. As defined by Commission on Chicago Landmarks staff, the home meets three defining criteria. Criterion 1, Critical Part of Cities History, applies due to the history of the house as part of Chicago’s early history when Austin was a rural settlement. The home was converted into a hotel during the World's Columbian Exposition and then was later home to the Austin Academy of Fine Arts. Today, the home is back to being used as a personal residence.  Criterion 3, for Significant Person, references Seth Warner, who, as a successful businessman and early settler of Chicago, is a significant figure in Chicago’s history. The final applicable criterion is Criterion 4, for Important Architecture. The home is an early example of the Italianate style which dominated American residential architecture from 1850 to 1880.   The Integrity Criterion applies as the house’s roof lines were changed overtime but restored during the 1980s. While the home’s setting has changed from rural settlement to urban neighborhood, the structure has remained in its original location.  The landmark designation will define all significant features to be protected as all exterior elevations including rooflines. With final landmark recommendation from the commission, the designation will go through approvals at City Hall including the Committee on Zoning and ultimately the full Chicago City Council. ",Austin
New renderings: Austin's Laramie Bank redevelopment gets updated design,"The team behind a proposal to preserve and expand the neglected Laramie State Bank building in Austin presented revised renderings of their West Side project to Chicago's newly formed Committee on Design. Under the plan, Austin United Alliance would transform the 1920s-era Art Deco structure at 5200 W. Chicago Avenue back into a bank plus a cafe space, business incubator, and a museum dedicated to blues music. Vacant land to the west would support a six-story addition containing 76 residential units, 30 parking spaces, a roof deck, and a publicly accessible plaza. The most recent images from architects Valerio Dewalt Train Associates and Latent Design show minor refinements to the development's architecture and programming compared to what the developers submitted to the city's INVEST South/West design competition earlier in the year. The most notable change is to the addition's western end, which was resized to better match the dimensions of the existing bank. ""Since [the competition], we have continued to study our brise solei, that protects the building from the sun at the corner of Latrobe and Chicago,"" said Joseph Valerio at Wednesday's virtual meeting. ""We wanted our new element to have a stronger geometric relationship to the historic bank building.""  The project's community room has also been repositioned to face the plaza along Chicago Avenue. The adjacent outdoor space features rotating screens that could display art while allowing the plaza to be secured during hours when it is not open to the public. Members of the Committee on Design were by and large receptive to the plan but did provide some feedback and suggestions. Comments included requests to locate more active use along the plaza and possibly shift the bank branch into the new building putting more community amenities in the old structure. The city's Department of Planning and Development will incorporate the comments into their ongoing review of the project.   ",Austin

DPD kicks off visioning for Belmont Triangle,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has kicked off the visioning for the Belmont Triangle in Avondale. Made up of approximately four acres of land, the triangular block is bound by W. Belmont Ave, N. Milwaukee Ave, and N. Pulaski Rd. More than half of the site is currently vacant due to recent business closures and building demolitions. The vacant parcels are addressed at 3240-84 N. Milwaukee, 3207-47 N. Pulaski, and 3934-62 W. Belmont. In collaboration with Alderman Ariel Reboyras of the 30th Ward, DPD identified the site for community visioning due to its diminished role providing retail- and service-oriented amenities for the neighborhood. The process is part of a strategy to maximize neighborhood opportunity sites throughout Chicago. At the kickoff visioning meeting, DPD announced that the project is leading into a Request For Proposal (RFP), to ultimately solicit development from local developers. The department will engage with the community to draft an RFP vision and ultimately release the RFP in late June this summer. Responses will be due in early Fall with the final selection expected by the end of the year. Currently, the entire block is zoned B3-1, which would allow for a variety of business uses and dwelling units on the upper levels. The properties are currently privately-owned, with no city ownership. The property owners are working in cooperation with DPD to redevelop the site. The meeting included a chance for attendees to begin to contribute input into the future of the site. The visioning process will allow for DPD to develop a concept for the RFP to guide respondents and indicate a potential use for the site. When asked about their vision for the site, common responses included calls for green space, affordable housing, a library, and a community center.  Ending with a Q&A portion, many questions were addressed. The site is within a TIF district and the project could utilize TIF funding or any other city funding available if deemed necessary. With the community’s interest in green space, representatives from DPD said that they envision green space to be part of the plan, but it’s too early to say in what capacity.  DPD will engage with its sister agencies as well to consider a library on the site as well as potential Chicago Park District space. They will also collaborate with CDOT to manage public realm improvements and traffic concerns. An environmental review will also be conducted, but it is not known whether any remediation will be necessary. The new project will likely be a Planned Development and may need a zoning change, requiring a string of approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. A timeline for the approval process once the winning selection has been made will be dependent on the scope of the project.  ",Avondale

United Yards breaks ground,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ald. Jeanette Taylor recently joined developers Celadon Partners and Blackwood Group to start construction on United Yards, a $58M mixed-use project that will revitalize the heart of the Back of the Yards neighborhood. As the winning team from the mayor’s Invest South/West RFP process for the site, the project includes multiple new and rehabilitated commercial and residential buildings near the 47th and Ashland intersection. ""This groundbreaking marks yet another milestone in our INVEST South/West journey to revitalize our underserved neighborhoods,"" Mayor Lightfoot said. ""The economic activity, job opportunities, health care, and housing options that United Yards is bringing to New City will catalyze future investment in the surrounding community for years to come. I've been proud to work with my team and deliver these kinds of transformative projects across the South and West sides over the last four years.""   Set to cost $17.9 million, the first phase of United Yards includes the adaptive re-use of a former Goldblatt’s showroom at 4700 S. Ashland as a 15,000-square-foot, federally qualified health center, which will provide primary care services, regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. Approximately 7,200 square feet will be used as retail space for La Selva Apparel Company, Back of the Yards Coffee, Back of the Yards Barbershop, and Aracely's Bakery.    The first phase also includes construction of a 6,500-square-foot building at 1641 W. 47th that will be anchored by Somos Monos Cerveceria. The city approved $5 million in TIF funding to help finance the first phase of the development.    The second phase of the project, set to cost $40 million, will deliver a 51-unit affordable apartment building with a 7,000-square-foot technology training center for minority entrepreneurs at 1515 W. 47th. A pair of affordable three-flats will also be built at 4706-08 S. Marshfield. All of the residential units in phase two will be affordable up to 60% of AMI.    With the groundbreaking celebrated, initial work is underway on United Yards’ first two phases. Work on these phases is expected to be completed by the end of 2024. The third phase, set to follow behind the first two, will see the mixed-use rehabilitation of the three-story “Rainbow” commercial building at 4701 S. Ashland.    ",Back of the Yards
Plan Commission approves industrial development at 328 W. 40th ,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved an industrial development at 328 W. 40th.

Princeton Ave to the east, and W. Root St to the south. Soudan Metals occupies an L-shaped property that results in this site being an irregular shape.  With Ware Malcomb on board for the design, the industrial project will deliver a one-story Class-A facility that encompasses 180,900 square feet of divisible space. With office space available to suit, the structure will be built of precast concrete painted with a bright color palette. With all truck loading facing the railroad abutment to the west, there will be two drive-in doors and 35 exterior docks for loading. 176 car parking spaces will be included for employees and visitors.  The site plan has been designed to bring trucks to the site up S.

TIF approved for United Yards Phase 1B,"The Community Development Commission has approved $4 million in TIF funding for the first phase of United Yards. Part of the winning Invest South/West RFP project, this phase is located along W. 47th St at 4700 S. Ashland, 4707 S. Marshfield, and 1641 W. 47th. Celadon Partners and Blackwood Development Partners are leading the project.  On the west side of S. Ashland Ave, the New City Supportive Living development, occupying the upper levels of the Goldblatt’s Building, is a previous project by Celadon Partners. As part of Phase 1B, the ground floor will be rehabbed into a 15,000 square-feet federally qualified health center, as well as 7,200 square feet of retail space for local, minority businesses.  Located at 1641 W. 47th, the second portion of this phase will take over a vacant lot at the corner of W. 47th St and S. Marshfield Ave. Designed by local firm DesignBridge, the new construction will be a two-story retail building measuring 6,000 square feet. Originally, the developers proposed residential facing W. 47th St when they went before the Committee on Design. Due to the fact that this would have required a zoning change, the plan was modified to place retail along W. 47th St and reorient the housing to face S. Marshfield Ave.  With the developers working with the community, each building is already set to receive retail tenants. In the Goldblatt’s building, the retail space set aside for minority small businesses will hold Back of The Yards Coffee, a T-shirt shop, a local bakery, and a barber shop. The small retail building just west of that will have a brewery in it that plans to share the building as a community gathering space as well as being the brewery. This phase of the project is set to cost $17.4 million, set to be financed by $1.3 million in deferred developer fees, $2.475 million in lender financing, $4 million in TIF, $4.1 million in Illinois Affordable Housing tax credits, $3.9 million in New Market Tax Credits, and $1.5 million from the Chicago Community Trust. With approval of the $4 million in TIF from the Community Development Commission, the redevelopment agreement and TIF proposal will head to City Council for a final vote of approval. If approved, the TIF will be split into a $2 million payment at issuance of the Certificate of Completion and $2 million at the one-year anniversary of the Certificate of Completion.  Once financing is in line, the developers will pull permits. Work is expected to take one year.  ",Back of the Yards

Committee on Design reviews United Yards,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the mixed-use United Yards proposal. Located along the W. 47th St corridor, United Yards encompasses a total of four sites engaged in a single redevelopment scheme for the area. The $60 million endeavor is a product of a joint venture between Celadon Partners and the Blackwood Group. The winner of the New City/Back of the Yards Invest South/West RFP, the proposal expanded the scope from the individual original site, reaching the aforementioned $60 million price tag. The development looks to construct a new anchoring building on the main parcel and fuel activation along the 47th St corridor around S. Ashland Ave. With a design from DesignBridge, the new construction will mimic the neutral and earth tones of the original buildings in the scheme.  Starting at the eastern edge of the development strip, the city-owned lot at 1515 W. 47th St is currently a vacant parcel. The original site of the RFP, the project will deliver a 50-unit affordable rental building with ground floor commercial space. The ground floor space within the six-story building will house a business opportunity fund. The developers will be working with the project team from the Back of the Yards RFP submission for the opportunity hub. Next, at the corner of S. Ashland Ave and W. 47th St, the Rainbow Building is an existing largely vacant building. The four-story commercial structure will be adaptively reused into a mixed-use project. It will hold 30 senior rental apartments with ground floor uses including a coffee shop and improved existing retail establishment.  On the west side of S. Ashland Ave, the New City Supportive Living development is a previous project by Celadon Partners. The United Yards project will see a new senior medical clinic and dialysis facility added to the ground floor commercial space. An existing blade sign will be repurposed as a New City gateway and identity signage. The final portion of redevelopment will be located at 1641 W. 47th St. Currently vacant land, the plan proposes to develop two affordable three flats to produce 6 two-bedroom apartments. The modular structures have already been fabricated according to the developer. As part of this phase, the plan looks to vacate S. Marshfield Ave to create an open green space for the new residents.  The project will take in comments from the Committee on Design as the development goes through city review. The plan will need approval for the sale of city-owned land from the Community Development Commission and City Council. Whether any further approvals will be needed is unclear. A timeline for construction hasn’t been determined. ",Back of the Yards
Three teams compete for chance to redevelop vacant Back of the Yards lot,"The city is evaluating responses from three teams of developers and community partners seeking to redevelop a vacant lot in the Back of the Yards/New City neighborhood. The project is part of the city's INVEST South/West program to revitalize commercial corridors in historically underserved neighborhoods on the city's South and West sides. City planners issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in November for the roughly 1,500-square-foot, city-owned site at the intersection of 47th and Justine streets. The responses were received in March and officials hope to identify a successful proposal by late summer. The new development should incorporate amenities such as multi-family housing, retail for local businesses, and community spaces that offer ""workforce development training, youth education, and after school programs"" according to the city's website. Thursday evening, officials from the Chicago Department of Planning and Development joined Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th) to co-host a virtual town hall to discuss the three proposals. A recording of the meeting is available on YouTube. ""Development in our communities usually happens to us and not with us, so I'm excited that myself and Ald. Lopez have worked with the Department of Planning to do development differently in our community,"" said Ald. Taylor at Thursday's meeting.""Just know that we are listening and this is a work in progress."" Ald. Raymond Lopez added, ""I am thankful for the three entities that put forth RFPs. The goal was to focus on housing, to focus on retail, and to focus on the community, and I am very excited by what has been proposed."" Here's a brief overview of the three responses: 1515 W. 47th Street LLC Led by Park Row Development, this project would bring 50 affordable studio, one-, and two-bedroom apartments to 47th and Justine. The exterior of the six-story proposal features a welcoming two-story entrance on the corner, rooftop solar panels, a mural, and public open space including a community garden. Inside, there will be an underground parking garage, affordable-rent commercial space for local businesses, and a hydroponics farm for growing micro and leafy greens. The team will partner with Precious Blood Ministry of Reconciliation to provide community programming to put neighbors on the path to homeownership by offering classes on home repair and financial literacy as well as job placement assistance.  The project's estimated cost is $19.8 million. Back of the Yards Works This estimated $15 million proposal forgoes housing in favor of a commercial hub that will provide job opportunities and training for the surrounding community. The development team is lead by Back of the Yards Coffee Co. in partnership with Condor Development. Featuring a grand staircase lined with native plants, the planned building will seek Living Building Challenge certification through sustainable elements like rooftop farms, which will produce grain for beer and baked goods. The building will be occupied by ""homegrown"" businesses and organizations including Back of the Yards Coffee, Sugarberry Bakery, La Selva T-Shirt Shop, the Marimba Institute, and Somo Monos Brewery. United Yards The $51.5 million United Yards proposal comes from New City Redevelopment Limited Partnership, a joint venture between Blackwood Group and affordable housing developer Celadon Partners. The plan is larger in scope than the others and goes beyond the 47th and Justine site, which would be redeveloped into 50 units of affordable housing and a community center. The Rainbow Building at 47th and Ashland would be restored to its former glory and transformed into 22 to 30 affordable senior living units and a new coffee shop for Stockyards Coffee. The developers would also renovate the New City Supportive Living facility in the former Goldblatt's building and construct a pair of new affordable-rate three-flats, a 70-space underground parking garage, and a community park at 47th and Marshfield in collaboration with Star Farm Chicago.   ",Back of the Yards
New elementary school in Belmont Cragin lands $34M permit,"A plan from the Public Building Commission of Chicago to build a new elementary school at the southeastern corner of Riis Park is moving forward in the Belmont Cragin community on the city's Northwest Side. On Tuesday, the project was awarded an estimated $34.4 million construction permit—a clear signal that work could soon begin along the 6100 block of West Fullerton Avenue.  The Chicago Park District Board voted in January to lease roughly 3.25 acres of parkland to the Chicago Public Schools for 40 years with an option to renew. Under the agreement, CPS will pay for the school, and the Park District will get $10 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) money to improve the park's existing 1920s-era field house, reported WTTW Chicago. Zoning for the Belmont Cragin project was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in February. Designed by SMNGA and FORMA Architecture, the new school will connect to the Riis Park field house and replace the old building's gymnasium wing. The upcoming complex includes a three-story classroom structure plus a multi-purpose building containing a gym, cafeteria, and auditorium space. The plan also calls for a new parking lot with spaces for 43 vehicles and improvements to the nearby playground.  Construction on the new school is scheduled to begin this fall, and the recent building permit is a good indicator that the project appears to be on track. If everything moves forward smoothly, the facility could be ready to open in time for the fall 2022 school year. George Sollitt Construction Company will serve as the general contractor, according to information listed on the permit.

Urbanize tours Howard Brown Health Halsted,"Urbanize has toured the recently completed Howard Brown Health Halsted, a new mixed-use development at 3501 N. Halsted. The federally qualified health center, which offers primary care and dental services, is located at the corner of W. Cornelia Ave and N. Halsted St the project stands five stories tall with a design from Eckenhoff Saunders Architects. With McHugh Construction serving as the general contractor, we began at the main entry of the building which opens to the intersection of W. Cornelia Ave and N. Halsted St. The entry opens to the main lobby with a counter and waiting room. An open stair leads patients up to the second floor where there is another waiting room before the patient would head back into the consultation and exam rooms. Heading up to the fourth floor, the interior has a similar layout with the waiting room at the corner of the building overlooking the intersection of W. Cornelia Ave and N. Halsted St. With dental offices on this floor, we walked through the patient area where they have consultation rooms and dental treatment rooms, including a kid's area with paintings on the wall. Our final stop was the fifth floor, which is currently a raw space that will be built out in the future with more space for Howard Brown. A shared outdoor terrace looks out towards the street and wraps around to the south side of the building to offer expansive views of downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. Wrigley Field is clearly visible from the western-facing outdoor deck.   While not part of our tour, the building’s basement includes 26 parking spaces for visitors, accessed from a ramp on W. Cornelia Ave. The ground floor also includes retail space that is occupied by Walgreens.  McHugh Construction broke ground on the building back in March 2022 and the building was topped out when Urbanize last visited in late November 2022. With the facility up and running, the flagship center is doubling Howard Brown’s patient capacity in the neighborhood. ",Boystown
Urbanize tours progress at 3501 N. Halsted,"Urbanize recently toured 3501 N. Halsted, a new mixed-use development for Howard Brown Health. Located at the corner of W. Cornelia Ave and N. Halsted St the project stands five stories tall with a design from Eckenhoff Saunders Architects. With McHugh Construction leading the construction, our tour began at the main entry of the building which opens to the intersection of W. Cornelia Ave and N. Halsted St. The first stop was a quick walk down to the basement level which will hold 26 parking spaces for employees and visitors. Cars will enter into the basement via a speed ramp off of W. Cornelia Ave. Our next stop was the ground floor, which will be home to a large retail space for a new pharmacy tenant. The building’s lobby for Howard Brown’s facilities will hold the corner of the building with a double height feature on the facade. A monumental open stair is planned to rise within the lobby to access the second floor.  We continued heading up the building, walking the second, third, and fourth floors. These floors will be home to offices for Howard Brown Health as well as exam and consultation rooms and dental offices. While the facade installation has not begun, materials have been staged on each floor in preparation for installation. Along the alley, the building will use a special material that can be installed from the interior to keep the alley open during construction. A combination of curtain wall and face brick will clad the street-facing elevations. Work on the building’s mechanical systems have begun on these upper floors as well. The tour’s last stop was the fifth floor, which will be home to further office space for Howard Brown Health. A shared outdoor terrace cantilevers out towards the street and wraps around to the south side of the building to offer expansive views of downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. Wrigley Field is clearly visible from the western-facing outdoor deck.   McHugh Construction broke ground on the building back in March 2022, and with concrete work topped out, work is on track for a July 2023 completion. The tower crane is expected to come down after Thanksgiving. Once opened, the flagship center will double Howard Brown’s patient capacity in the neighborhood. ",Boystown
Demo permits issued to make way for new Pui Tak Christian School,"Three demolition permits have been issued to make way for the new Pui Tak Christian School building. Proposed for a site in Bridgeport at 3118 S. Canal, the new school will replace a surface parking lot in addition to the three existing buildings on the site.  The Pui Tak Christian School was founded in 1953 to equip young students academically and spiritually and teaches students from preschool all the way through 8th grade. The school is looking to build the new facilities due to a collection of challenges including the fact that their current facility is at capacity, they have limited classroom space and are using mobile and temporary classrooms. They also have insufficient bathrooms and are split between two different buildings.  With SOM and Wight and Company collaborating on the design, the new building would stand four stories high and offer space for approximately 400 students and 45 staff members. Rising 55 feet, the school is massed sensitively to the area, setting back 57 feet from the street, as well as 37 feet from the south to create a buffer between the school and nearby residential homes. This space along the south side of the property will be occupied by a playground for the students.  The entry to the school will be pronounced with an inset along the bar-shaped plan, with a portal-like space that exhibits openness and transparency. The gymnasium will float above the staff parking to the north of the entry as a glowing, frosted glass box, while classrooms will span the length of the building south of the entry.   The ground floor of the school will be host to the reception and staff office as well as five Pre-K rooms. On the second floor, the aforementioned gymnasium will double as the auditorium and will be accessible to the public for events through a stair and elevator. The remainder of the second floor will hold the library and junior kindergarten rooms. On the third floor, students will have access to the cafeteria and art room, as well as kindergarten and first grade classrooms. Classrooms for 2nd through 8th graders will be located on the fourth floor, as well as the language room, music room, and science room.  The building will have a sustainable design by utilizing a green roof, installing solar panels, retaining rainwater, using an energy-efficient HVAC system, using vertical fins for self-shading, providing permeable pavers and extended landscaping on the site, alongside a host of other efforts.  With demo permits issued, the three-story building at 3130 S. Canal, the one-story building at 3136 S. Canal, and the three-story building at 3140 S. Canal will all be razed to make way for the development. The school has been working on this plan for a number of years and even acquired the property back in April 2019. The school is looking towards 2024 or 2025 as a target for construction. ",Bridgeport
Landmarks approves final landmark recommendation for Ramova Theater,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the Ramova Theater. Located at 3508-3518 S. Halsted, the building was completed in 1929 for Lithuanian businessman Jokūbas Maskoliūnas as a motion picture theater serving the Bridgeport neighborhood. Located mid-block on S. Halsted St, the theater served as a neighborhood movie palace from its opening in 1929 until it was closed and left vacant in 1985. The adjoining commercial block, visually tied to the theater through exterior ornament, was home to numerous neighborhood businesses.   Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Ramova Theater, completed in 1929, is an excellent example of a historic motion picture theater, a novel building type that emerged in the early twentieth century designed to entertain its patrons through the new medium of cinematic art. With its practical combination of commercial storefronts with a theater, the Ramova Theater is a fine example of a “theater block,” a historic building type found in Chicago’s neighborhood commercial districts combining entertainment and commercial storefronts in a single building. The Ramova Theater represents the contributions of newcomers to Chicago’s cultural and economic heritage as the theater was built by Jokūbas (Jacob) Maskoliūnas, a Lithuanian immigrant to serve the immigrant neighborhood of Bridgeport. The building also meets Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. With its twisted columns, cartouches, scallop shells, scrolls, pinnacles, niches, and swirling, naturalistic plant forms, the façade of the Ramova Theater exemplifies the Spanish Baroque style of architecture, examples of which are rare in Chicago. The elaborate decoration of the façade is rendered in glazed terra cotta which was formed in hand-carved molds requiring a high degree of design and hand craftsmanship.  The scale and ornate quality of the building’s architecture reflect the ideals of historic movie theater design to use architecture as advertisement and to attract customers with a promise of luxury and escape from the ordinary. The Ramova Theater is representative of a practical building type that developed in the late 1920s. The theater block was characterized by a traditional commercial block anchored by a prominent theater visually tied together through exterior architectural detailing. Meeting the separate Integrity criterion, the Ramova Theater retains very good integrity. Character defining features, including overall form, location of fenestration and entrances, and masonry details remain on the exterior. Throughout the Ramova’s history, its theater and commercial blocks were improved and modernized to reflect changing fashion. The primary east elevation along Halsted Street remains largely unchanged from the building’s competition in 1929. The most significant early alteration was in 1944 with the replacement of the theater’s marquee and blade signs. The Moderne style blade sign was restored, and the marquee rebuilt, as part of the building’s overall rehabilitation in 2023.  The Ramova Theater closed in 1985 and remained vacant and deteriorating, while its commercial block retained businesses until it was closed in 2012. In 2007, significant masonry work was performed on the east elevation of the commercial block. This included the full reconstruction of the second-floor east wall. Historic terra cotta and matching replacement units were reinstalled with replacement face brick. New double-hung windows and modern storefronts were also installed. As part of the 2007 renovation, some significant features were removed, including the decorative wrought iron balconette railings in the second-floor windows and terracotta finials along the roofline. The building featured a clay tile roof above the commercial block, which was replaced with asphalt shingles in 2007.  A second renovation to the commercial block in 2012 involved the replacement of the original metal and glass storefronts and the construction of a taller brick knee wall with modern metal and glass storefront windows.  In 2023, the Ramova underwent a very substantial restoration. The project was aided by more than $9 million in tax-increment financing from the city, and the Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit The terracotta along the Halsted Street elevation was restored and the missing finials were returned to the roofline. New metal and glass storefronts were installed, and the theater entrance was restored with new metal and glass doors. Although the terra cotta pilasters flanking the theater entrance were covered by metal panels as part of the 1944 modernization, the terra cotta was restored and exposed during the 2023 renovation.  The interior of the Ramova was also fully restored in 2023. The theater experienced heavy water damage to its decorative plaster finishes and other features during its decades of vacancy. However, the overall atmospheric style of the main lobby and auditorium retained important 18 plaster features, including faux Spanish Revival style courtyard building facades and rounded smooth plaster ceilings resembling a night sky. During the 2023 rehabilitation, the lobby and auditorium plaster finishes were secured, and areas of loss were recreated. A new balcony was built at the rear (south) end of the auditorium. The Ramova’s commercial block was renovated to create a new ground floor restaurant and upper floor event space. The recent restoration of the Ramova Theater has transformed it into a multi-use building that will include a live performance music venue, a brewery and tap room, and restaurants. The Landmarks Commission staff recommend that the significant features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building, including the blade sign and marquee from 1944. With the final landmark recommendation from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks secured, the proposed designation will head to City Hall for approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.  ",Bridgeport

The building featured a clay tile roof above the commercial block, which was replaced with asphalt shingles in 2007.  A second renovation to the commercial block in 2012 involved the replacement of the original metal and glass storefronts and the construction of a taller brick knee wall with modern metal and glass storefront windows.  In 2023, the Ramova underwent a very substantial restoration. The project was aided by more than $9 million in tax-increment financing from the city, and the Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit The terracotta along the Halsted Street elevation was restored and the missing finials were returned to the roofline. New metal and glass storefronts were installed, and the theater entrance was restored with new metal and glass doors. Although the terra cotta pilasters flanking the theater entrance were covered by metal panels as part of the 1944 modernization, the terra cotta was restored and exposed during the 2023 renovation.    The interior of the Ramova was also fully restored in 2023. The theater experienced heavy water damage to its decorative plaster finishes and other features during its decades of vacancy. However, the overall atmospheric style of the main lobby and auditorium retained important 18 plaster features, including faux Spanish Revival style courtyard building facades and rounded smooth plaster ceilings resembling a night sky. During the 2023 rehabilitation, the lobby and auditorium plaster finishes were secured, and areas of loss were recreated. A new balcony was built at the rear (south) end of the auditorium. The Ramova’s commercial block was renovated to create a new ground floor restaurant and upper floor event space. The recent restoration of the Ramova Theater has transformed it into a multi-use building that will include a live performance music venue, a brewery and tap room, and restaurants. The Landmarks Commission staff recommend that the significant features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building, including the blade sign and marquee from 1944. The proposed designation will need a final landmark recommendation from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks before it goes to City Hall for approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.

Ramova Theatre reopens after historic renovation,"McHugh Construction has announced that it has completed the $30 million adaptive reuse transformation of Chicago’s historic Ramova Theatre from a long-shuttered single-screen cinema to an 1,800-person concert hall in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood. As part of the 36,000-square-foot project at 3520 S. Halsted, McHugh also built out space for Other Half Brewing, an independent craft brewery and taproom; Ramova Grill, an 18-seat diner; and Ramova Loft, a second-floor 200-person event venue. Ramova Theatre originally opened at the tail end of the Roaring Twenties and quickly became the jewel of the Bridgeport neighborhood with its neon red marquee and Spanish-inspired architecture. However, decades later ticket sales slowed, leading to Ramova’s closure in 1985. After sitting dormant for nearly 40 years, Ramova’s historical and artistic significance was officially recognized with its addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 2021. “When we first arrived on the site, it was like a time capsule, with the ticket booth still in place – even with the same curtains from the day it closed,” said Andrew Totten, vice president of McHugh Construction. “But it was in such a state of disrepair after years of neglect. Severe water damage destroyed large areas of the plaster ceiling, and the terracotta façade on Halsted Street was missing several parts. “It was the exact type of complicated project our experienced restoration team loves to bring back to life,” he added. “McHugh has been around longer than the Ramova Theatre, so we knew exactly how and when to preserve, protect, rebuild and start anew, like when we took casts of the building’s remaining terracotta pieces and had them remade. We were honored to return the building to its 1929 glory and create a magical experience for the community once again.” For more than two years, McHugh Construction worked closely with project architect O’Riley Office, Baum Revision and historic preservation specialists to meticulously restore the ornate architectural details in Ramova’s original Spanish courtyard-style lobby and auditorium. Revived are the pale-yellow stucco-style walls, red-notched archways and columns, decorative bronze wrought-iron faux windows and balconies, a clay-tile roof line and a ceiling painted midnight blue – all evoking the beautiful and inviting hacienda ambiance, just like the day Ramova opened in 1929. Gone are the velvety movie theater seats. In their place is a 22,000-square-foot barrier-free multi-level concrete floor in front of an expansive stage. While rows of spotlights hang from the ceiling, casting multi-colored glows throughout the concert hall, the venue’s new speaker system amplifies the onstage vocals and instruments, connecting artists with the audience. Multiple bars were installed in the back of the auditorium and a second-floor balcony was revived to offer clear views of the stage. “The South Side of Chicago is home to the majority of local artists, but it has had the least amount of high-quality space for them to perform and hone their craft – from an aesthetic as well as acoustic point of view,” said Tyler Nevius, Ramova’s developer. “The city needed this and the South Side needed this.” With an eye to attracting big-name performers, Ramova’s new greenroom is worthy of any A-lister, with four separate suites – each with full baths – and an office for tour managers to conduct business, noted Nevius. To protect artists from paparazzi and unauthorized personnel, McHugh created direct paths for touring vehicles to arrive, unload equipment and privately access the greenroom and performance area. “Andy [Totten] and I talked with quite a few artists as part of the process,” Nevius said. “First and foremost, we wanted to create a place where they would want to come and perform. One that looks great, sounds even better and where people can enjoy a show in comfort, which meant a five-star air conditioning system.” That required McHugh and its subcontractor teams to draw on decades of historic restoration experience to conceal state-of-the-art HVAC, electrical, sound and fire protection systems within the early 20th century fabric of the theater building. McHugh also tapped its in-house structural engineering team, McHugh Engineering Group, for expertise on structural modifications and additions to historic and complex structures. “Having McHugh and its breadth of experience has been unbelievable,” Nevius said. “Multiple times we went to the McHugh office and worked on the whiteboard to understand how to fit everything into the venue. It was incredibly tight to shoehorn everything in while remembering what’s essential. For instance, it’s very important for the audience to have immediate and clear access to the bars and bathrooms.” Staying true to its mission as a neighborhood gathering place, Ramova Loft, the 200-person venue on the second floor above the brewery and taproom, offers space for smaller performances by up-and-coming artists as well as events for local schools and community groups. The parking lot across the street from the building can also be used for community events such as farmers markets, and the empty lot adjacent to the south side of Ramova has been reimagined as a new outdoor beer garden. The renovated Ramova Theatre grand opened on Dec. 31, 2023, with a 1920s-themed live performance of music and dancing to ring in the new year. The glitzy marquee once again lit up Halsted and 35th streets, and the auditorium’s atmosphere transplanted revelers to a grand Andalusian patio. The adaptive reuse project was funded by investments from the local populace, tax-increment financing subsidies from the City of Chicago, a state grant, and a Historic Places loan. ",Bridgeport
City Council approves rezoning at 500 W. Pershing,"The Chicago City Council has approved the rezoning of 500 W. Pershing. Located at the northwest corner of S. Normal Ave and W. Pershing Rd, the site is currently a series of vacant lots. William Barbaro is leading the development. Designed by 360 Design Studio, the project is building two townhome buildings that will each have 6 three-story townhomes. Each townhome will have two parking spaces and private balconies. With two townhome buildings on the site, individual homes will be oriented east/west and face outwards from the center of the site. The middle of the site will have a private drive running parallel to the buildings to connect to private garages, accessed from the alley. Each townhome will have a balcony that hangs over the private drive. With City Council approval, the site will now be rezoned from M1-2 to RT-4 to allow for the scope of the development. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Bridgeport
Updated vision presented for new Pui Tak Christian School,"The Pui Tak Christian School recently presented updated plans for their new school building, proposed for a site in Bridgeport. Located at 3118 S. Canal, the new school would replace surface parking and two existing buildings. While the school originally envisioned rehabbing the existing structures, they were found to be in very poor condition and not up to code for use as a school. The Pui Tak Christian School was founded in 1953 to equip young students academically and spiritually and teaches students from preschool all the way through 8th grade. The school is looking to build the new facilities due to a collection of challenges including the fact that their current facility is at capacity, they have limited classroom space, and are using mobile and temporary classrooms. They also have insufficient bathrooms and are split between two different buildings.  With SOM and Wight and Company collaborating on the design, the new building would stand four stories high and offer space for approximately 400 students and 45 staff members. Rising 55 feet, the school is massed sensitively to the area, setting back 57 feet from the street, as well as 37 feet from the south to create a buffer between the school and nearby residential homes. This space along the south side of the property will be occupied by a playground for the students.  The entry to the school will be pronounced with an inset along the bar-shaped plan, with a portal-like space that exhibits openness and transparency. The gymnasium will float above the staff parking to the north of the entry as a glowing, frosted glass box, while classrooms will span the length of the building south of the entry.   The ground floor of the school will be host to the reception and staff office as well as five Pre-K rooms. On the second floor, the aforementioned gymnasium will double as the auditorium and will be accessible to the public for events through a stair and elevator. The remainder of the second floor will hold the library and junior kindergarten rooms. On the third floor, students will have access to the cafeteria and art room, as well as kindergarten and first grade classrooms. Classrooms for 2nd through 8th graders will be located on the fourth floor, as well as the language room, music room, and science room.  The building will have a sustainable design by utilizing a green roof, installing solar panels, retaining rainwater, using an energy-efficient HVAC system, using vertical fins for self-shading, providing permeable pavers and extended landscaping on the site, alongside a host of other efforts.  The school has been working on this plan for a number of years and even acquired the property back in April 2019. Since then, COVID has hampered progress, but the school is looking towards 2024 or 2025 as a target for construction, with a capital campaign leading up to the start of construction. The project will need approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals to allow a school on the site as a special use.  ",Bridgeport
Summer Construction Week: Ramova Theater,"Summer is the quintessential time of year for construction, especially with our cold winters here in Chicago. As we near the end of the summer, Urbanize has toured a series of construction projects in the city to check in on progress on the latest developments. Today, we begin with an inside look at the renovation of a neighborhood gem: the Ramova Theater. Originally built in 1929 as a movie theater, the Ramova Theater, located at 3520 S. Halsted, has stood vacant in the Bridgeport neighborhood since 1985. Tyler Nevius of Our Revival Chicago has teamed up with Baum Revision to reinvigorate the building and bring it back to life. After years of planning, work is currently underway on-site. Stretching down S. Halsted St, the project combines the Ramova Theater building with two commercial buildings that face the street, screening the theater space. Exterior work on the brick and terracotta is wrapping up, with some terracotta pieces having been molded and remade to replace broken pieces. The marquee sign will be removed and shipped off for restoration once the scaffolding comes down later this week. We began the tour inside the building right behind the boarded-up entry to the lobby. After decades of neglect, the interior has significant water damage and, at this point in time, has undergone selective demolition by McHugh Construction as part of the project. As part of the restoration, the lobby will be brought back to its original Spanish Courtyard style, with lots of plaster work ahead. Heading into the main theater, the space is impressively large upon first entry. Large openings have been dug into the floor as part of mechanical work and the space is currently an open shell. The space will be reconfigured with a new stage protruding into the original seating area, and a new second-floor balcony will be added to expand capacity. Before full restoration work can be done on the plaster ceiling and walls, the ceiling will be opened up to reinforce the structure for large lighting rigs. The new live music venue will have a capacity of approximately 1,700 people once completed. Fronting the street just north of the theater entry, the next stop on the tour was the taproom. As part of the entire project designed by O’Riley Office, the taproom will see the construction of a new bar and dining space overlooking brewery operations on the basement level. Partnered with a local brewer, the space will be built out similarly to the brewer’s original Chicago location. For brewery patrons, a small strip of land just south of the theater entry will be turned into an outdoor beer garden. Above the taproom, a second-floor space is under restoration with reinforced bowstring trusses. With a capacity for approximately 200 people, the space is being envisioned for potential small acoustic or private performances as well as being opened to local community businesses for art festivals and other events.  At the north end of the project, the final building will be converted into a small diner. Measuring 800 square feet, the 30-seat diner will open up in the 1880s building, reviving the former Ramova Grill that closed in 2012. Kevin Hickey, award-winning chef and owner of The Duck Inn, will run the restaurant once it is opened. At the back of the building, a ramp will go down into the basement for brewery operations. As part of the development, all of the spaces will be connected to allow for access between them. While giving each space its own identity and separate entries from the street, stairs and elevators will be added to facilitate access within the building. A small interior courtyard will be enclosed and turned into space for restrooms.   With McHugh Construction leading the construction, completion is set for late spring 2023. ",Bridgeport
Permits issued for mixed-use building at 2805 S. Halsted,"A $6 million permit has been issued for the construction of a four-story mixed-use residential building located in Bridgeport. Developed by Jackie Chan of J & I Development, the new construction will rise on the long-vacant parcel. Situated directly across from Palmisano Park, the corner property at 2805 S. Halsted St will front both S. Halsted Street and W. 28th St.  The four-story, neighborhood-focused, mixed-use development will hold retail space, parking, and 28 dwelling units. The small retail space will hold a coffee shop facing onto S. Halsted St while the rest of the ground floor offers indoor parking for 28 cars accessed from the alley. With a design from Hirsch MPG, the structure will be built of wood construction and masonry bearing walls perched on a precast concrete plank podium. The project has been designed to be as economical as possible to keep the units affordable. The unit mix will offer larger units to bring families to the area while also offering smaller units for single individuals.  With the reported $6 million permit in hand, MPI Contracting Inc., the designated general contractor for the project, can commence construction.

Renovation of Bridgeport's Ramova Theater begins,"The long-awaited rebirth of Bridgeport's Ramova Theater took a big step forward this week as co-developers Our Revival Chicago LLC and Baum Revision broke ground on an estimated $28 million renovation. The project will breathe new life into the historic structure at 3518 S. Halsted Street, which was designed by Meyer O. Nathan in 1929 in the Spanish courtyard style as a companion venue to Lakeview's Music Box Theatre. The Ramova has sat vacant since closing in 1985. When it reopens in late 2022, the reimagined venue will be home to a 1,600-seat auditorium and a balcony-level theater accommodating up to 200 people. The plan also includes an adjacent 4,000-square-foot brewery and tap room, an 800-square-foot Ramova Grill restaurant at 3510 S. Halsted Street, and a 50-space parking lot across the street. The developers selected McHugh Construction as general contractor and O'Riley Office to serve as architect on the $28 million adaptive reuse project. Developer Tyler Nevius of Our Revival purchased the dilapidated Ramova property from the city for $1 and was awarded $6.8 million in tax increment financing (TIF). The project was first approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in January 2020 but had to go before the commissioners again in July of this year due to ""delays brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.""    ",Bridgeport
Brighton Park Neighborhood Council community center scores permit,"A full building permit has been issued for the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council’s new community center and headquarters.

Park District cuts ribbon on new headquarters,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Chicago Park District CEO Rosa Escareño, and local community leaders cut the ribbon on the new Chicago Park District headquarters and multi-purpose fieldhouse and green space for families in the Brighton Park neighborhood. The new Park District headquarters and fieldhouse at 4830 S. Western brings 17 acres of open space to one of Chicago’s most park-deprived communities and further the City’s commitment to bring significant investment to areas in need.   “The new Chicago Park District headquarters and community park is a prime example of how meaningful investments can transform a neighborhood and bring valuable resources and opportunities to residents,” said Mayor Lightfoot. ""For far too long, Brighton Park families have had to travel to neighboring communities to access essential park resources. This project marks a new day for Brighton Park and our city as the headquarters will serve the vitality and well-being of Southwest Side communities.”  The Chicago Park District will relocate its administrative headquarters to the building from its current Streeterville location in early June. This 58,100 square foot, multi-story facility with 17 acres of multi-use park space will include a new 20,000 square foot public fieldhouse that will bring new recreation, as well as cultural and educational opportunities, to the neighborhood. Formerly a contaminated industrial property, the 17-acre campus park will include two artificial turf athletic fields with lighting, a grand lawn, walkways, a playground, spray pool, natural area, nature play space, and bike and vehicle parking. The fieldhouse features a gymnasium, fitness center, bathrooms, locker rooms, and community multi-purpose rooms.  Designed by John Ronan Architects, the building design is rooted in the history of the Southwest Side and stands as an example of the future of sustainable development in an area known for manufacturing and industry. The walls of the courtyard and interior spaces are made of reclaimed Chicago common brick, and all of the building materials were selected for their constructability, durability, and ease of maintenance.  Additionally, aluminum sunscreen shields the building from direct sunlight to increase the overall energy efficiency of the building. The building includes window glazing that is bird-friendly and patterned with a ceramic frit to warn off incoming birds. In addition, the project has EV charging stations - with space to expand for more, 102 bike parking spaces, and a 15,000 square foot green roof. ",Brighton Park
New Park District HQ in Brighton Park ready to begin construction,"A plan to build new headquarters for the Chicago Park District in the southwest side neighborhood of Brighton Park is ready to move forward after scoring its first construction permit. Slated for a 17-acre site near the intersection of 48th Street and Western Avenue, the new two-story facility features a circular design from Chicago-based John Ronan Architects clad in a scalloped metal screen.  The 78,000-square-foot building will not only contain offices for the Park District but also serve as a fieldhouse for three new athletic fields and a community playground and spray pool. First announced in 2018 by then-mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Brighton Park project was seen as a way for the Park District to own rather than rent its offices and to make an investment in one of Chicago's neighborhoods. The city agency will move out of offices in Streeterville, which belong to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. ""The development of the Brighton Park site for the Chicago Park District headquarters is a win-win situation for the district and the community,"" said Superintendent Michael Kelly in a 2018 statement. ""In addition to the efficiencies of owning our headquarters, we are bringing much-needed parkland and amenities to the children and families of this community.” In December, the city's Transportation Committee voted to vacate 19,000 square feet of South Campbell Avenue near 48th Street, reported the Chicago Sun-Times. The move was seen as one of the final hurdles facing the long-discussed project. The new HQ will relocate 200 existing Park District jobs to Brighton Park and is expected to create approximately 350 construction jobs in the process. The permit estimates the scope of the work at $55 million and lists F.H. Paschen, S.N. Nielsen & Associates as the project's general contractor.    ",Brighton Park

According to the developer, it's time to reignite the energy and pride of this historic neighborhood. With local architect JGMA in charge of the design, the multifamily residential and mixed-use project features an outdoor museum, honoring Bronzeville’s rich heritage and iconic musicians. The three buildings will use a unique facade system to show iconic musicians and people of significance for Bronzeville while hosting residential units and retail space inside them. It's a catalyst for positive change, preserving the community's heartbeat while celebrating its diversity. -- The final site is Site 6, measuring 55,500 square feet located south of E. Oakwood Blvd at 3950 S. Lake Park. Developers CBBC have teamed up with DOM Properties to create a multifamily building on the site. Designed by Valerio Dewalt Train Associates, the building takes the form of a mid-rise multifamily building that creates a U-shape in plan with a courtyard in the center. Two-story townhomes are situated along the street, enclosing the courtyard and buffering the taller building from the street.  As the concepts progress, DPD will award the sites to the selected development teams who will then need to proceed with the typical approval processes to make the concepts become a reality. A timeline is currently unknown for the proposals.  ",Bronzeville

Cook County Health plans health center in Lake Meadows Pavilion,"Cook County Health announced that it will be opening a new community health center at 467 E. 31st Street, Chicago in Bronzeville. Bronzeville Health Center will join CCH’s portfolio of more than a dozen community health centers located across Chicago and suburban Cook County. As one of the largest public health systems in the nation, CCH is dedicated to creating access to high quality, comprehensive health care services to the residents of Cook County regardless of ability to pay. “The Bronzeville Health Center represents Cook County’s ongoing commitment to ensuring equitable access to high-quality health care services,” said Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. “The health center holds the promise of not only addressing the immediate health needs of the community, but also fostering long-term improvements in health outcomes on Chicago’s South Side.”   Anchored by CCH’s historic Provident Hospital, Bronzeville Health Center will offer family medicine, behavioral health, and rehabilitation services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. The 26,000 square foot facility is projected to see 85,000 visits in its first year and will include 44 exam rooms and a gym space for therapy services. The family medicine and behavioral health practices are moving from their existing location within Provident Hospital’s Sengstacke Health Center into Bronzeville Health Center, which offers a larger, more modern space to better serve patients. The move also frees up more clinical space within Provident Hospital to allow for the expansion of hospital-based services, further enhancing access to care. Patients will continue to be able to receive comprehensive primary and specialty outpatient care at Sengstacke Health Center as well.  Bronzeville Health Center represents the latest expansion of CCH’s services on Chicago’s South Side.

On the exterior, the landmarked home will get a new cornice and windows as well as masonry and roof repairs. The interior landmarked spaces will be retained in the house. A coach house at the back of the site will be demolished. As part of the reconfiguration, the home and addition will get new galleries, meeting rooms, archive space, support, and other spaces. Historic information indicates that the wooden planks of the Burroughs Gallery used to be much lighter, so the team plans to remove the stain through a chemical process to bring it back to its original state. While the wooden planks are removed, additional insulation will be added into the walls to improve the thermal performance of the building envelope. Other non-original finishes including tile and paint will be removed to restore the original condition of interior spaces. To connect the new addition to the historic home, a small kitchen wing will be demolished. The addition itself is at the back of the site so that the main building can remain in the foreground. The portion north of the home will be a two-story structure clad in rainscreen paneling with an accessible approach made of light-colored concrete. The addition will step up to three stories behind the house and be clad in glass curtain wall. The small portion just south of the home will have the rainscreen paneling on the first two floors and glass curtain wall on the third floor.  Due to a deadline to spend one of the organization’s funding grants, the team plans to use an early design package to allocate those funds before starting full construction in April 2025. The center is expected to be completed by Summer 2026. ",Bronzeville

New apartments and condos take shape along North Branch Corridor,"In ""east Bucktown,"" work continues on the new mid-rise residential development known as Triangle Square. The estimated $200 million project has been under construction at 2155 N. Elston Avenue since early 2020, and is now starting to resemble renderings of the finished product. Triangle Square gets its somewhat contradictory geometric name (how can a triangle be a square?) from the odd shape of its three-sided 4-acre lot. Previously home to a billboard facing the Kennedy Expressway, the once vacant site is bounded by Elston Avenue, Webster Avenue, and Metra’s UP-North rail tracks. The main piece of the project is a seven-story apartment building from LMC, a subsidiary of Miami-based developer Lennar Corp., and Chicago architecture firm Lamar Johnson Collaborative. With the help of Power Construction, the Lennar-Lamar team will build 398 studio, one-, and two-bedroom rental units above 35,000 square feet of retail space fronting Elston. The rental building snakes it way around site and has a distinctive sloping roofline. Amenities include a fitness center, club room, game room, and co-working spaces. The project's literal centerpiece will be a 23,000 square foot outdoor terrace facing the Chicago skyline. The supersized communal courtyard features a pool, grills, fire pits, and a bocce court.  The second piece of the Triangle Square equation is a separate seven-story condominium building along Webster Avenue. Developed by Belgravia Group and designed by Sullivan Goulette & Wilson, the more traditional-looking masonry structure includes 72 for-sale units offered in two- and three-bedroom floorplans, priced from $495,000 to $1 million. There's no word yet on the rent prices for the apartments, which are expected to welcome residents this fall. The condominiums, which broke ground earlier, are on track to deliver this summer.  Triangle Square was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in September 2018. The plan requires nine affordable units on-site plus a $3.6 million contribution from the developer to Chicago's affordable housing fund, according to the Chicago Department of Planning and Development. The project was made possible by a sweeping rezone of the North Branch Corridor in 2017, which opened 760 acres of industrial land along the Chicago River's north branch to new uses including residential. Other projects are expected to soon follow including the massive Lincoln Yards megadevelopment that's zoned for up to 6,000 residences.    ",Bucktown
Plans for riverfront driving range in Bucktown scrapped,"A three-story driving range and entertainment complex is no longer in the works for the North Branch of the Chicago River in Bucktown. Operator Drive Shack has scrapped plans for its $40 million redevelopment of the 9.3-acre Vienna Beef factory at the Damen-Elston-Fullerton intersection, across from the Midtown Athletic Club.  Similar in concept to Topgolf, Drive Shack’s Chicago location would have included more than 100 climate-controlled driving range bays oriented toward the Chicago skyline plus both indoor and outdoor dining facilities.  The project was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in January 2020. And while its 337-car parking lot wasn’t exactly the pinnacle of urban design, the plan did include some unique site-specific features such as a landscaped public riverwalk along the waterfront.  Chicago Golf Report broke the news on Drive Shack’s decision to abandon its Bucktown plans. The publication did not say why the company pulled the plug on the project. Paul Sajovec, a staffer for Ald. Scott Waguespack, told Block Club Chicago that any future redevelopment of 2501 N. Damen Avenue would have to essentially restart the zoning process “unless someone else wants to develop the property under the same basic plan.” ",Bucktown
Residential development at 4102 N. Sheridan scores permits,"A full building permit has been issued for a residential development at 4102 N. Sheridan. Located along N.

With 32 units in the building, the mix will include 5 studios, 17 one-beds, and 10 two-beds. On the ground floor, a bike room will hold 24 bikes and 16 parking spaces will be provided.  The developers received a special use from the Zoning Board of Appeals to allow for residential on the ground floor, but the underlying zoning will remain the same. With the building permit issued, Barrett Homes can begin work on the new construction.  ",Buena Park
City Council approves 640 W. Irving Park,"The Chicago City Council has approved the mixed-use development at 640 W. Irving Park. Conceived by KGiles LLC and CA Ventures, the development is located along N Marine Drive, between W Irving Park Road and W Bittersweet Place. With Level Architecture in charge of the conversion of the Immaculata School, the three attached buildings will be converted to hold 245 apartments, made up of mostly studios and one-beds with five two-bedroom configurations. 20% of the overall unit count, or 49 units, will be designated as affordable. Through the conversion, the main lobby stair will remain, but must be enclosed inside a vestibule to meet current fire codes. A rooftop deck will be added onto the 1956 school addition with a large setback from W. Irving Park Rd to reduce its visibility. A new elevator and stair penthouse will poke up above the roof to serve the new roof deck. Windows on the school buildings will be rehabilitated or replaced as needed with masonry tuckpointing also planned.  With a design from Perkins Eastman the new 22-story senior living tower, located on the parking lot behind the school, will contain 108 independent living units, 60 assisted living units, and 32 memory care units. 20% of the unit count, or 20 units, will be designated as affordable. The building is designed in an L-shape based on the site and to preserve views. Rising 250 feet, the tower will be clad in a mix of glass and textured metal paneling with punched window openings. The podium will rise the first five floors encased in a bronze-colored metal panel with brick veneer on the ground floor. A forecourt off W. Bittersweet Pl will be the main access for vehicles with a parking garage for 98 cars included.

PRC approves Immaculata revamp at 640 W. Irving Park,"The Permit Review Committee has approved plans to convert the Immaculata High School into apartments at 640 W. Irving Park. Conceived as part of a larger plan by KGiles LLC and CA Ventures, the development will see the conversion of the school into apartments as well as the addition of a 22-story senior living tower on the parking lot behind the school. Located in Buena Park, the project is located along N Marine Drive, between W Irving Park Road and W Bittersweet Place. The landmarked property consists of the original 1922 Prairie Style school building that sits at the southeast corner of the property. A 1955 convent addition was built to the north in 1955 and a school addition was added to the west in 1956. The landmark designation encompasses all parts of the school including the additions but doesn’t specify what should be protected. Staff visited the school and have deemed all exterior elevations as well as the central lobby cast iron stair and two-story auditorium on the interior as significant features to be protected from demolition or alteration. With Level Architecture in charge of the conversion, the school will be converted to hold 245 typical apartments, made up of mostly studios and one-beds with five two-bedroom configurations. 20% of the overall unit count, or 49 units, will be designated as affordable. Through the conversion, the main lobby stair will remain, but must be enclosed inside a vestibule to meet current fire codes. A rooftop deck will be added onto the 1956 school addition with a large setback from the street to reduce its visibility. A new elevator and stair penthouse will poke up above the roof to serve the new roof deck.  New windows will be installed to match the original which were replaced without approval. The condition of the remaining historic windows will be investigated, and repairs will be made as needed. Facing the interior courtyard, some windows will be converted into operable windows to meet code requirements and some new basement windows will be added.  With an estimated cost of $65 million for the adaptive reuse, the combined development with the new tower is what makes the conversion financially feasible.  With a design from Perkins Eastman the 22-story senior living tower will contain 108 independent living units, 32 memory care units, 60 assisted living units and 98 parking spaces behind the historic building. 20% of the unit count, or 20 units, will be designated as affordable. With approval from the Permit Review Committee, the project can move forward with other approvals. The project recently received approval from 46th Ward Alderman Cappelman and it will go before the Chicago Plan Commission later this month before garnering final approval from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.

CDC approves land acquisition for Columbus Ave reconstruction,"The Community Development Commission has approved the proposed land acquisition for the reconstruction of S. Columbus Ave in Chicago Lawn. Planned for the stretch between S. Kedzie Ave and S. Western Ave, CDOT is leading the project to expand S. Columbus Ave and separate it from the train tracks that currently cross the street. With the Belt Railway currently crossing at grade, cars and pedestrians must stop which creates an inconvenience and the crossing becomes a safety issue. The project is looking to reduce congestion, traffic flow, and enhance safety as 45 crashes have been reported at the crossing since 1956. The crossing is also a critical route for emergency vehicles. To improve the crossing, the railroad will be kept at the same elevation and S. Columbus Ave will be lowered under the railroad with a new bridge built for the train tracks. To support the project, a small pump station will be built to convey stormwater from the roadway underpass. As part of the project, S. Columbus Ave will be rebuilt and widened with new bike lanes and widened sidewalks. Dedicated bike lanes will be incorporated with painted lanes on the roadway with one-way lanes going each direction.  To make room for the widened roadway, CDOT will acquire a set of properties along the corridor. At S. Maplewood Ave and S. Campbell Ave, the streets will be terminated and turned into cul-de-sacs because they will now be higher than the newly lowered roadway. The $86 million project will be funded via a variety of sources, including $45 million from the National Highway Freight Program, $1 million from the REbuild Illinois Program, $17 million from the State Only Chicago Commitment, and the final $22.5 million has yet to be secured. Despite the $22.5 million shortcoming, the project will use absolutely no city funding. The final apportionment will come from either state or federal financing sources.  Phase 1 engineering has been completed and Phase 2 engineering is expected to be completed by Q3 2022. Construction is expected to begin in Q1 2023 with a completion date of Q4 2024.  ",Chicago Lawn

City Council approves Class L incentive for redevelopment of Hoyt Building,"The Chicago City Council has approved a Class L tax incentive for the redevelopment of the Hoyt Building at 465 W. Cermak. Located within the Cermak Road Bridge District, the building sits along the south branch of the Chicago River on the south side of W. Cermak Rd. Developer Windfall Group is behind the mixed-use adaptive reuse. Originally designed by architects Nimmons and Fellows and completed in 1909, the facade was designed with brick piers ornamented with limestone and terracotta details. The entrance to the Hoyt Company’s offices on the second floor is centered on the Cermak Road elevation with an ornamental terracotta surround. On the interior, concrete columns support large, open floor plates. With SPACE Architects + Planners on board for the adaptive reuse, the redeveloped building will hold a 4-star extended stay hotel, a grocery store, retail, dining, entertainment, a spa, and a medical center. The larger development will include new retail and a parking garage on adjacent lots. The $40.8 million project will fully rehabilitate the building envelope, replacing damaged masonry where needed and repointing masonry joints to match the existing mortar. Some of the windows were previously replaced in 2018, so planned work will repair and replace existing windows as needed while restoring window openings that were infilled with concrete block or plywood. At the base of the building, a new arcade will be carved into the east elevation by inserting a new glazed storefront system 8 feet behind the masonry piers to create an entryway into the building. To the north of the new entry arcade is a sunken plaza that will create a publicly accessible walkway through the building to a new portion of riverwalk. The new riverwalk will be complimented by a second new arcade that sets into the lower level almost 14 feet.  On the roof, the rehab will replace the glazing in the skylights and add rooftop solar panels. New HVAC units will provide the building with modern ventilation and cooling. Three new elevator shafts will be carved into the building and overruns will rise out of the roof accordingly. On the top floor of the building, portions of the roof will be removed to create courtyards which will be framed with new glazed storefronts and metal cladding. The development will have a minimum investment of just under $5 million, with the expenditure of $32.3 million in qualifying rehabilitation expenses. This expenditure exceeds the 50% minimum investment required to qualify for the Class L tax incentive. As outlined, the development will have a total tax abatement of approximately $15.5 million over the 12-year period of the tax incentive.

CTA awards Red Line Extension construction contract,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has taken the next major step in the Red Line Extension (RLE) project by selecting contracting team Walsh-VINCI Transit Community Partners to design and build the 5.6-mile extension of the Red Line from 95th Street to 130th Street, including four new Red Line stations. The Chicago Transit Board has approved the award of a $2.9 billion contract to Walsh-VINCI Transit Community Partners following a comprehensive, two-year procurement process. The RLE is a transit equity project that fulfills a commitment to the Far South Side by significantly improving transportation to this part of the city with 5.6 miles of new track and four new fully accessible rail stations at 103rd, 111th, Michigan near 116th and 130th Street. The project’s budget has increased to $5.3 billion, which includes financing expenses, to cover cost increases for construction materials, labor and financing. The prior project budget was $3.6 billion before finance charges and $4.1 billion including financing costs. CTA is moving forward with the project to fulfill the long-ago promise to the Far South Side that the RLE would be built. Delaying the project would potentially increase the budget by several billions of dollars.  “The Red Line Extension corrects past transit inequity and increases access to the most affordable transportation in the city. Hiring the contracting team that can provide the best value to the CTA to construct the RLE is a consequential step that demonstrates our vow to build this project,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The CTA’s Red Line Extension Project is an example of how transportation dollars can be distributed to have lasting impact on the Far South Side including workforce and small business opportunities that create jobs and support families.” The contracting team will be responsible for building the Mainline project, which includes the extension of the Red Line 5.6 miles from the 95th Street to south of 130th Street as well as building the four new, accessible stations near 103rd Street, 111th Street, Michigan Avenue and 130th Street, each expected to include bus, bike, pedestrian and parking facilities. Walsh-VINCI Transit Community Partners includes Walsh Construction, VINCI Construction, EXP, Systra, and other subcontractors. Construction is expected to start in late 2025 and be completed by 2030.  The CTA is beginning advance construction work this fall, including demolition of properties acquired for the project and advance utility relocation, which includes removing wires and poles and relocating utility equipment ahead of major construction in late 2025.

Final design for Redefine the Drive proposes lakefront highway with no transit priority,"IDOT and CDOT recently hosted an open house to share their final preferred alternative for the redesign of North DuSable Lake Shore Drive. The North DuSable Lake Shore Drive Phase 1 Study is looking to improve the corridor by improving safety and mobility, addressing infrastructure deficiencies, and improving access and circulation. According to the agencies, the 7-mile corridor from Grand Ave to Hollywood Ave has as many as 170,000 vehicles per day  After a years-long process, alternatives that would’ve included light rail transit, tunnels or causeways, or a local street with dedicated bus lanes were all ruled out. According to information shared, light rail was dismissed because the alignment along the lakeshore would require passengers to board or transfer to/from E-W bus routes at or beyond the urban edge and wouldn’t be able to directly serve destinations inland from NDLSD. No clear transit mobility improvements would be created compared to existing or improved NDLSD express bus services and would require specialized vehicles, maintenance shop and storage yard according to the agencies. According to materials from the agencies, the selected alternative, dubbed ‘The Essential’, would significantly improve access and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists; would reduce transit delays by 7 minutes while improving reliability, rider comfort, and lakefront access; improves automotive safety and operations while minimizing cut through traffic; and reduces the footprint in Lincoln Park with no additional miles of ramos and lanes. As IDOT and CDOT finalize the study, they will have community-focused design discussions with community members through 2024 and into 2025 with a final public hearing in 2025 before they complete the study in 2025 to become eligible for federal funding.

Residential development proposed at 1055 W. Diversey,"Developer Contemporary Concepts Inc has presented plans for their proposed development at 1055 W. Diversey to the local community. Planned at the southeast corner of W. Diversey Pkwy and N. Seminary Ave, the project site is currently occupied by a former church building whose congregation is moving to a different location.  Designed by Studio Dwell Architects, the new development would stand five stories tall with 24 residential units. The residential units will be split into one one-bed, nine two-beds, 13 three-beds, and one four-bedroom unit. While four units will be set aside as affordable, the market rate units will be priced at $3000/month for two-beds, $4,000-$4,200/month for three-beds, and $5,500/month for the four-bedroom unit. Rising approximately 58 feet tall, the five-story building will be clad in brick with metal accent panels and a sawtooth brick pattern accent on the ground floor. The windows on the ground floor will feature limestone surrounds.  The building’s residential entry will front N. Seminary Ave, with five residential units and a bike room for 7 bikes on the ground floor. A single accessible parking space will be accessible from the alley. Two of the ground floor residential units will have private terraces. Community members had mixed reactions. One neighbor asked if the developer considered building a larger building, but they felt this size was a sweet spot for buildability and fitting into the neighborhood context. Another neighbor asked for more green initiatives in the building and another neighbor asked for more bike parking. While feedback was mostly positive, one neighbor raised concerns about the lack of parking, but Alderman Knudsen explained how residents in this TOD building would be ineligible for neighborhood permit parking to mitigate impacts on neighbors. To allow for the development to move forward, the developer is seeking a rezoning from RT-4 to B2-3 as well as a set of zoning variations. If they receive support from the alderman, the development team would seek to introduce the zoning application in April, go before the Committee on Zoning and City Council in May and then start the permitting process. The construction period would last approximately a year and they hope to finish in Summer 2025. ",Citywide

Photos: Peek inside the newly completed Tribune Tower condos,"After paying $240 million for Chicago's famous Tribune Tower in 2016, co-developers CIM Group and Golub & Company are finally ready to take the wraps off their multiyear conversion of the landmark 1925 neo-Gothic skyscraper into luxury condominiums. Urbanize Chicago was invited for a sneak peek of the renovation project, overseen by architecture firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz.  The tour began in the development's more contemporary lobby off of Illinois Street. This area led to a bank of elevators for the northern wing of the Tribune complex (the former WGN TV building), which has received a four-story vertical addition to house more condos. From there, a longer-than-expected hallway lined with art zig-zagged southwest to the tower's historic Michigan Avenue lobby. Home to the ""Hall of Inscriptions"" featuring quotes about the press from Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, and others, this lobby is mostly untouched since it was the only interior portion of the building included in the property's landmark designation. The only noticeable changes are some new lounge furniture and more art. According to the development team, the entire project contains $1 million worth of custom commissioned artwork. Next, we headed to the third-floor amenity level. Here, the so-called ""great room"" includes a large kitchen for entertaining and multiple seating areas that can be used to socialize or work. One such nook, dubbed ""McCormick's study,"" has the original fireplace salvaged from the 24th-floor office of former Chicago Trib owner Col. Robert McCormick.  The third-floor great room opens out onto a nearly one-third-acre private park with lush landscaping and meandering walking paths. Since many residences have private terraces directly overlooking this courtyard, the elevated park has no seating or grills to keep things tranquil. The more active outdoor amenities are located elsewhere in the building. The historic tower's main lobby hall is two and a half stories high, so the western portion of the third-floor amenities features a split-level design. A short flight of stairs connects to the game room with darts and billiards and a pair of private meeting rooms overlooking yet another seating area called the ""Pioneer Court library.""  The next stop was the tower's striking 25th-floor amenity level which is home to a curving terrace that wraps nearly 360 degrees around the building's crown. The space offers outdoor seating, grilling stations, an herb garden, and impressive views of the city and lake between the tower's Gothic flying buttresses. The interior of the 25th floor includes additional lounge seating, a full catering kitchen, and a place to eat if your picnic on the terrace suddenly gets rained out. The amenities keep going on the seventh floor, where residents can enjoy a south-facing sun deck behind the iconic ""Chicago Tribune"" sign and more outdoor grilling stations. This space overlooks Pioneer Court, which is in the midst of its own makeover as part of the Tribune Tower redevelopment. The seventh floor's 75-foot indoor lap pool was still under construction during our walk-through, so snapping photos was off-limits. We also swung by the second-floor fitness center, spa, locker rooms, golf simulator, and indoor putting green. The final stop was Tribune Tower's sales gallery, located in one of the unsold residences. As expected, the condos deliver top-notch finishes, high-end kitchens, and crown moldings throughout. The complex contains 162 for-sale units priced from $900,000 to over $7 million. According to sales director Jeanne Martini, seventy of the condos are under contract, of which 55 have closed. The first owners moved in on June 30, she said. Construction work is ongoing at the tower's base, which will reopen as new retail space. CIM and Golub have already secured a long-term commitment from the Museum of Ice Cream to occupy 13,000 square feet in the tower. Crews are also putting the finishing touches on renovations to Nathan Hale Court along Michigan Avenue. The famous bronze statue of Nathan Hale will be making a return to his namesake courtyard, but poor Mr. Hale is currently entombed in a wooden box marked ""top-heavy."" With the Tribune Tower renovation all but complete, CIM and Golub can next turn their attention to the project's second phase: a 1,422-foot skyscraper slated to rise at the vacant parcel located just to the east of the historic tower (formerly a Tribune employee parking lot).

Photos: BMO Tower nearing completion next to Union Station,"Workers are putting the finishing touches on downtown's 50-story BMO Tower (also known as Union Station Tower) ahead of the Class A building's anticipated January 2022 opening. Since topping off its concrete core in April, the high-rise at 320 S. Canal Street has received the rest of its structural steel. The 730-foot structure is almost entirely wrapped in glass except for its exterior skip hoist.  Much of the remaining exterior work is focused at the tower's base, where crews from Clark Construction are cladding the V-shaped columns flanking the lobby. Work also continues on the 400-car, two-level parking garage located just west of the tower that will eventually be topped by a 1.5-acre publicly accessible park.  Canada-based BMO Financial Group is signed on to occupy 500,000 square feet in its upcoming 1.5 million-square-foot namesake Chicago skyscraper, developed by Riverside Investment & Development and Convexity Properties and designed by architecture firm Goettsch Partners. The glassy tower replaces an Amtrak parking garage which closed in late 2019.  In addition to developing BMO Tower, the Riverside-Convexity team also has city zoning approval to convert the upper floors of the historic Union Station headhouse across the street into 400 hotel rooms. There's been no word on when that project will begin construction. ",Downtown
Two-tower development slated for 601 W. Monroe adds public dog park,"Vancouver-based Pacific Reach Properties has further refined its plans for a pair of 47- and 40-story high-rise apartment towers at 601 W. Monroe Street. If approved, the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed development would bring 1,053 rental units, 30,000 square feet of retail, and 430 parking spaces to a 1.5-acre site in the West Loop Gate, currently occupied by a surface parking lot. The latest raft of changes includes the addition of a 3,000-square-foot publicly accessible dog park next to Heritage Green Park. Additionally, the ground-floor setback on South Desplaines Street has increased four feet to boost the sidewalk width to nearly 20 feet, according to a recent email from the office of Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd). The developer has also agreed to ""numerous commitments"" to keep neighbors happy during construction, the email said. Putting pressure on a developer to provide a public dog park is hardly a new move for Ald. Reilly, who has previously advocated for canine amenities at Exhibit apartments in River North and the One Bennett Park development in Streeterville. The fact that little else about the proposal has changed since breaking cover in Februrary is an encouraging sign that Pacific Reach Properties is likely close to earning the alderman's blessing for 601 W. Monroe. The proposal will also require the support of the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards and City Council before work can begin. The developer will also be on the hook for a $5.5 million contribution to the city's Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, which supports economic investment in underserved communities on the city's South and West sides. If city approvals go as planned, Pacific Reach aims to break ground on the taller 47-story east tower in early 2022 and deliver the building in mid-2024. The 40-story western tower would open in 2025, an executive at Pacific Reach told the Chicago Tribune earlier this year. ",Downtown
Photos: Mixed-use Michigan Avenue tower climbs skyward near Millennium Park,"Work on the upcoming mixed-use high-rise at 300 N. Michigan Avenue is really flying. The estimated $250 million project broke ground last summer in the thick of the global pandemic, and by our rough floor count is well past the halfway point to achieving its 47-story, 523-foot final height. The tower's climbing formwork is even visible from the main branch of the Chicago River.  A joint venture between hometown developers Sterling Bay and Magellan Development Group, the project will include 25,000 square feet of retail space topped by a 280-room CitizenM Hotel occupying floors 6 through 15. Above the hotel, there will be 289 rental apartments and a top-floor amenity terrace for residents offering views of Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, and Lake Michigan. The transit-oriented development will include just 22 parking spaces located in a below-grade garage. Designed by Chicago-based bKL Architecture, 300 N. Michigan is wrapped in a glass facade with horizontal banding. Its most striking feature is a series of angled structural trusses between the retail and hotel levels which earned the project the nickname the ""M&M building"" by Urbanize Chicago photographer Harry Carmicheal. The development even incorporates the beam geometry into its ""300 N. Michigan"" logo, seen posted just above the ground-floor scaffolding.  The development team is providing seven units of affordable housing on-site and contributing $4 million to the Affordable Housing Fund and $3.9 million for Chicago’s Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, which will be reinvested in the city’s underserved communities. Linn-Mathes serves as general contractor.  The high-rise replaces an older four-story masonry structure which was demolished in 2019. If there's a downside to the new development, it's that it will soon block views of the iconic Art Deco Carbide & Carbon Building from the Michigan Avenue Bridge—so soak up that perspective while you still have the chance.  According to Sterling Bay, 300 N. Michigan is on track for June 2022 occupancy. When the downtown tower opens, it will bring more activity to the already bustling section of Michigan Avenue between Millennium Park and the Chicago River that some have dubbed the ""Millennium Mile."" It will join relatively recent projects such as the MILA apartments, LondonHouse, and the Hotel Julian. ",Downtown
"Downtown high-rise proposal with more than 1,000 apartments moves forward","A proposal from Vancouver-based Pacific Reach Properties for a pair of glassy apartment towers at 601 W. Monroe Street is forging ahead in the city's approval process after the developer filed a recent zoning application for the West Loop Gate project. Rising 47 and 40 stories (535 and 465 feet, respectively) atop a shared podium, the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed towers would bring 1,053 rental units, 30,000 square feet of retail, and 430 parking spaces to a 1.5-acre site located between the four Presidential Towers, Heritage Green Park, and Old St. Patrick’s Church. The location is currently home to a surface parking lot.  The two-phase proposal was first revealed by Ald. Brendan Reilly in a February 19 newsletter to neighbors. Reilly said the developer had been working on the proposal since 2018 and the team incorporated a number of changes at the alderman's request. Revisions include cutting the towers down from their original heights of 54 and 47 stories, eliminating a hotel component, increasing retail space, and slightly curbing the amount of parking. The project falls under the city's existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) which requires projects that receive a zoning change to provide 10 percent affordable housing (an updated version of the ordinance takes effect in October and bumps the requirements to 20 percent for downtown projects). Pacific Reach will provide seven of its required 105 affordable units on-site and satisfy the remainder of its obligation by paying into the city's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund, according to the application. The developers will also pay the city $5.5 million for a density bonus.  Mark Marshall, senior vice president of development and construction at Pacific Reach, told the Chicago Tribune in February that his company was ""definitely optimistic"" about the apartment market rebounding post-COVID. If approvals go as planned, the developer aims to break ground on the taller 47-story east tower in early 2022 and deliver the building in mid-2024. The 40-story western tower would open in 2025, Marshall told the newspaper.  Though not quite as ""booming"" as Fulton Market to the west, the area between the Chicago River and Kennedy Expressway is seeing an impressive share of real estate activity. Recent office projects like the adaptive reuse of the Old Post Office will be joined by upcoming commercial developments like BMO Tower and 609 W. Randolph Street. Construction is currently underway on a 373-unit apartment development at 354 N. Union Avenue , and the Chicago Plan Commission recently approved a 413-unit rental tower for the parking lot at 640 W. Washington Boulevard.     ",Downtown
Architects envision new intermodal riverwalk for Chicago River's south branch,"Chicago-area design firm DMAC Architecture has revealed an ambitious vision for bringing new open space and a riverwalk to the south branch of the Chicago River. Located just east of the office building at 300 S. Riverside Plaza, the concept was created in response to Amtrak's concept to reactivate an unused platform near Union Station and add egress stairs to street level. DMAC, working with property owner Third Millennium Group, saw the situation as a chance to create something special. ""We felt there is a solution for egress that can be satisfied in a much better way,"" DMAC founder and principal Dwayne MacEwen told Urbanize. ""You can't make this the 'back door' to Union Station. It should be the front door to the city and river. Chicago exists where it does because of the river. To not embrace it seemed like a missed opportunity."" The concept treats the need for new stairs as a starting point to extend a perimeter walkway around 300 S. Riverside and potentially down to the waterfront with a series of ramps. The upper terrace is envisioned as an outdoor dining area, while the lower levels serve as public gathering spaces and piers that could be used by kayakers, tour boats, and floating ""tree taxi"" islands. The walkways would allow train passengers to emerge from Union Station at river level, while an acoustic ""veil"" and baffle in front of the platforms would help absorb sound. A proposed pedestrian connection would pass beneath the Van Buren Street Bridge and provide access to the redeveloped Old Post Office property.  The landscaping takes inspiration from the location's existing features, which include wild vegetation growing on remnants of the sea caves—a series of sunken waterfront tunnels leftover when engineers reversed the flow of the Chicago River in 1900. The concept also takes advantage of intermodal connectivity at the site, which is served by trains, buses, boats, bicycles, and even helipads on the roof of 300 S. Riverside. Described by Third Millennium Group managing director Adam Mizrachi as a ""love letter to Chicago,"" the so-called Riverwalk@300SRP plan is still very much in the concept phase. Its designers hope renderings of the project can start a conversation about how to make it a reality.  ""This is a 'love letter,' so we're not at the altar yet,"" said MacEwen. ""Developers often look at a project from the standpoint of how it impacts the bottom line, but this is something that the city should want to do.""  ""It's ambitious, we know,"" added the architect. ""But there's also a sense that if phase one is adding the egress stairs from the train platform, let's do it in a way that still allows [the riverwalk] to happen later.""  Amtrak spokesperson Marc Magliari confirmed that have been discussions about activating the unused tracks under the Old Post Office as passenger platforms serving Union Station, but challenges remain and no decision has been made.  ""These tracks were designed to connect to the Old Post Office and not Union Station, so riders would have to cross active tracks to get to them,"" Magliari told Urbanize. ""We have to find a way to solve the issues of getting people from the station to the platform in a safe and accessible way."" Magliari also noted that nearby developments such as Bank of America Tower, Southbank, and The 78 already provide riverwalks on the opposite bank of the river. ""There's the question of where the city intends to build a continuous riverwalk for the south branch,"" Magliari said. This post has been updated with additional information from Amtrak. ",Downtown
BMO Tower tops off across from Union Station,"After breaking ground in late 2019, construction on downtown's upcoming 730-foot-tall BMO Tower topped off on Thursday. Although the 50-story building's steel skeleton and glass curtain wall still need to play catch up, the skyscraper's concrete core has reached its final height. A special beam signed by construction workers was hoisted to the top of the structure to mark the milestone.  To make the official topping-off that much more official, crews from Clark Construction were joined by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who touted the development for the 1,500 union jobs it created and the 6,000 office workers who will eventually call the building home. BMO Tower (also known as Union Station Tower) is located at 320 S. Canal Street, just south of the Union Station headhouse and transit center. Development partners Riverside Investment & Development and Convexity Properties were selected to revitalize the station and surrounding Amtrak-owned real estate in 2017.  In addition to developing BMO Tower (which replaced an older Amtrak parking garage), the team also has city approval to eventually convert the upper floors of the historic station into 400 hotel rooms. Chicago-based Goettsch Partners designed the newly topped-off high-rise. It features a glassy facade with vertical striping and large chevron-shaped structural supports at its base. The project also includes a 1.5-acre publicly accessible park atop a 400-car parking garage located just west of the tower. The finished skyscraper is expected to welcome tenants in January 2022. Canada-based BMO Financial Group is signed on to occupy 500,000 square feet in its new 1.5 million-square-foot namesake Chicago skyscraper. Like the Salesforce-anchored office building under construction at Wolf Pont, BMO Tower will face a vastly different office market than when it was originally conceived. The rise of the pandemic and remote work has many companies reevaluating their space needs, and BMO Tower could contribute to a potential glut of unleased space.  The project is located kitty-corner from the massive Old Post Office which was renovated into a whopping 2.8 million square feet of office space in 2019.   ",Downtown
Photos: Checking in on Salesforce Tower at Wolf Point,"Roughly a year after breaking ground along the banks of the Chicago River, downtown's Salesforce Tower is more than 20 floors in the air. The building's concrete core continues to soar skyward and workers have been installing structural steel beams for the past several weeks. Developer Hines Interests and crews from Walsh Construction started work on the $800 million project in April 2020 and have persevered through the pandemic, stay-at-home orders, and economic uncertainty.  The 60-story, 820-foot-tall office tower represents the third and final phase of the three-building Wolf Point Development. It is flanked by the existing 485-foot Wolf Point West apartments and the 660-foot Wolf Point East rental high-rise. Designed by architecture firm Pelli Clarke Pelli, Salesforce Tower Chicago features a glassy curtain wall facade, underground parking, and a continuation of Wolf Point's publicly accessible riverwalk.  Anchor tenant Salesforce will occupy 500,000 square feet in the 1.2 million-square-foot building. The deal gives the company not only naming rights for the tower previously known as Wolf Point South, but also corporate signage at its crown.  The riverfront skyscraper is on pace to finish construction by the end of 2022 and welcome its first tenants in early 2023. In the meantime, downtown Chicago's office market grapples with COVID-related record vacancies and the growing work-from-home trend. Upcoming developments like Salesforce Tower and the 1.5 million-square-foot BMO Tower (under construction near Union Station) will add even more supply to the mix. It's entirely possible that these projects may be the last new office skyscrapers to break ground in Chicago for some time.   ",Downtown
Big changes are coming to Chicago's affordable housing ordinance,"At Wednesday's City Council meeting, Mayor Lori Lightfoot introduced her long-awaited proposal to overhaul Chicago's affordable housing requirements in new development projects. The existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) requires residential developments with 10 or more units to set aside a portion of apartments or condos as affordable housing. Projects that are subject to Chicago's ARO include developments that receive a zoning change, financial assistance, or land from the city. Under the current rules, developments that come under the ARO are required to build 10 percent affordable units or pay what are called ""in-lieu"" fees that the city uses to fund other affordable housing programs. Since the policy went into effect in 2007, it has generated $124 million of in-lieu payments but produced only 1,049 affordable residences (as of last year).  The revised ordinance boosts the affordability requirements to 20 percent in developments located downtown, in neighborhoods with low levels of affordable housing, and in so-called ""community preservation areas"" facing displacement of low-income residents. Some areas of the city, such as the West Loop, have already adopted a 20 percent requirement as part of a pilot program enacted by the city in 2017. Under Lightfoot's proposed ordinance, developers can still opt out of building units on-site, but the in-lieu payment fees will increase. At least 50 percent of units are required to be built (either on-site, off-site, or across a combination of the two), which is an increase from the 25 percent required under the current ARO. Off-site units can now be built in any area of the city as long as it is lacking affordable housing. And if a project triggers ARO requirements in a transit-oriented development (TOD), any off-site units must also be located in a similar transit-served area. Additionally, the ordinance requires builders to provide more units for residents earning below the 60 percent area median income (AMI) ""affordability"" threshold established under the previous rules. Developers that decrease that threshold for lower-income residents can build fewer units. The revised rules also include incentives to provide larger family-sized affordable-rate units. ""As city leaders, it is our responsibility to step up and do the work to reverse the adverse effects segregation has had on our city,"" said Mayor Lightfoot in a statement Wednesday. ""These effects, which include disinvestment, gentrification, and a historic life expectancy gap, are at odds with our values of equity and inclusion. ""Thanks to this ordinance, we will be able to better address these negative impacts and move our city that much closer to fully ensuring that all of our residents, regardless of their income, will have the ability and opportunity to live wherever they choose in Chicago."" Lightfoot's proposal incorporates many findings and recommendations from the Department of Housing Inclusionary Housing Task Force. According to a report published by the task force in September, Chicago faces an estimated citywide shortage of nearly 120,000 affordable homes. While few dismiss the problems caused by the city's shortfall of affordable housing, real estate developers have generally cautioned against raising the ARO requirements, arguing that it could make it more difficult to finance new construction. If too restrictive, the new rules could have the opposite effect. Projects that can't get off the ground won't be able to generate any new units of affordable housing or pay the in-lieu fees that bring vital funding to many of the city's other affordable housing initiatives.  Mayor Lightfoot's plan will need to strike a delicate balance to achieve its goal of bringing more affordable housing to the neighborhoods that need it the most.  If the ARO requirements are indeed set too high, we might see a flood of developers rushing projects through city hall before the new rules go into effect.  ",Downtown

The project combines the existing 7,000 square feet the organization is already occupying with an adjacent recently vacated adjacent space of approximately 5,000 square feet, in two long span bow-truss buildings formerly used as a soda factory. The design aims to create a flagship location, an iconic headquarters for Revolution Workshop that is a hub for the organization’s activities which showcases the breadth and impact of the RW’s work. The design focuses on creating urgently needed spaces for the Revolution Community, including highly functional and flexible shop space, engineered for the future of construction; welcoming and contemporary office space, to support staff and social services; and bold, collaborative environments for trainees to learn, build, and come together. All of these spaces are designed with RW’s preference for functional, welcoming aesthetics in mind: industrial materials mix with pops of color to create a unique palette.  By re-organizing the building’s floor plan and organization to run east-west, the main shop becomes larger and more flexible, as well as with direct access to sidewalk dock doors. New openings in the building’s exterior west wall and skylights allow for natural light in the building.

CTA receives $111 million in funding for Forest Park Branch Rebuild,"The Chicago Transit Authority was recently awarded $111 million by the Department of Transportation’s Reconnecting Communities Grant Program, which will be used to replace more than 10,000 feet of Blue Line track between Kedzie and Pulaski. “This funding is a critically needed investment in the Forest Park Branch and allows us to continue to move forward on our promise to improve rail service on the west side,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “This grant reinforces the Biden-Harris’s Administration’s commitment to improving safety and equity through investments in public transit. We thank Senators Durbin and Duckworth, and the Illinois Delegation, for their support of this important project.” The project is located within the East Garfield Park and West Garfield Park communities of Chicago. This track work will benefit riders in an area that has traditionally lower income households, a higher minority population, and more transit-dependent residents than the rest of the city.  The Blue Line track work between Pulaski and Kedzie is tentatively expected to begin in Summer 2027. Reconnecting Communities is intended to advance community-centered transportation connection projects, with a priority for projects that benefit disadvantaged communities, that improve access to daily needs such as jobs, education, healthcare, food, nature, and recreation, and foster equitable development and restoration. This grant represents the latest investment to support the Forest Park Branch Rebuild – a multi-year, multi-phased investment program to reconstruct the entire Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line and make it 100% accessible to those who use mobility devices. Starting last summer, the CTA rebuilt 15,000 feet or almost three miles of tracks between the LaSalle and Illinois Medical District (IMD) stations; demolished and began rebuilding the Racine station to meet modern accessibility guidelines; and upgraded the traction power system for improved service reliability as part of Phase 1 of the project.

Harrison Row Townhomes surpass 50% sold,"Structured Development has announced that sales have surpassed 50% at Harrison Row Townhomes, a for-sale housing development delivering 40 affordable townhomes near the intersection of W. Harrison St and S. Francisco Ave in East Garfield Park. Created under Chicago’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO), the multi-phase development is reserved for qualified households earning up to 120% of the area median income (AMI).  Two of the three phases at Harrison Row have sold out. Phase 1, comprising seven three-story, three-bedroom, 2 1⁄2-bath homes on Congress Parkway starting at $229,000, and Phase 3, comprising five three-story homes featuring four bedrooms and 2 1⁄2 baths, starting at $249,000, have sold out.  Phase 2, which includes 28 Kinexx-fabricated modular two-story duplexes on Harrison Street containing three bedrooms and 1 1⁄2 baths, has 13 sold or under contract and the remaining 15 are selling for prices starting at $245,000. “Surpassing 50% sold at Harrison Row is a notable milestone and illustrates the need for for-sale workforce housing,” said Mike Drew, co-founding principal of Structured Development. “Many working-class Chicagoans struggle to find homes they can afford because they earn too much to qualify for traditional low-income housing programs but can’t afford to purchase market-rate homes. This is especially true when it comes to larger three- and four-bedroom homes suitable for families, and this is exactly the type of housing we created at Harrison Row.” Harrison Row offers opportunities for lower-income families to achieve homeownership while helping Structured Development fulfill its obligation under Chicago's ARO for Wendelin Park, Structured’s latest residential community in Lincoln Park’s Clybourn Corridor. Under the terms of the ARO, Harrison Row Townhomes are required to remain affordable for at least 30 years. Qualifying buyers are sourced through the Chicago Housing Trust (CHT), a nonprofit corporation administered and staffed by the Chicago Department of Housing that seeks to preserve the long-term affordability of homes created through city programs, including the ARO.

Washington served a critical role in providing care and opportunity to Chicago’s most vulnerable, including women and children who could not afford health care after being discharged from hospitals; homeless, destitute, or otherwise abandoned women without options; abused and neglected adolescent girls; unwed mothers and their children; and the larger homeless population of the city.  The buildings have served as a care facility under four different organizations, including the Chicago Home for Convalescent Women & Children, the Florence Crittenton Anchorage, the Volunteers of America’s Living Center for Girls, and Inner Voice, Inc. as the need for social services in the neighborhood and city evolved.  The main house is an excellent example of a residential building in the Queen Anne architectural style. Built circa 1880, through a series of remodelings, the building was transformed from a small frame dwelling to a brick mansion. The complex roofline with front-facing gable and dormers, asymmetric composition, corner tower with conical bay, decorative richness and variety, and projecting bays exemplify the style.  The dormitory and its sympathetic later addition reflect the Italian Renaissance and French Eclectic period styles popular in the 1920s during the second phase of the Eclectic movement in America. The building features distinctive masonry and stucco detailing with dark red brick window surrounds and quoining contrasting with flat, white fields of stucco. These unusual design motifs reflect the Eclectic movement’s preference for “correct” architectural detail and give the building a distinctive presence in the East Garfield Park Community Area. The dormitory was designed by the noted Chicago architecture firm of Holabird & Roche whose founders were recognized as major, innovative, and prolific practitioners of the Chicago School of architecture. The successor firm of Holabird & Root and then Holabird, Root & McGee, the firm responsible for the 1948 addition to and remodeling of the dormitory, continued to shape the look of the City of Chicago over the course of the twentieth century and they remain a major contributor to the city’s architectural excellence. Meeting the separate Integrity Criterion, the main house retains the same form, location, design, setting, and majority of materials in place since its last major remodeling in 1910 during the period of significance. Some windows and doors have been replaced, but this is typical for buildings of this vintage. Exterior work from 2017 appears to have involved the replacement of the dentillated pressed metal cornice at the top of the second floor with flat bands of siding, but the overall impact is not enough to interfere with the home’s historic appearance. The dormitory also maintains the same form, location, design, setting, and majority of materials in place since its last major remodeling in 1948 during the period of significance. There are isolated patches of stucco loss and masonry failure, but these can be repaired. Windows and doors have also been replaced but this alone is not enough to detract from the historic appearance. The landmark designation will protect all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the main house and dormitory as well as the 2011 bronze “Passage” sculpture. The current location of the ""Passage"" sculpture is not integral to the site’s historic configuration, so the statue may be relocated elsewhere on the site.  ",East Garfield Park

CDC approves TIF for BandWith Chicago,"The Community Development Commission has approved TIF funding for the redevelopment of a formerly industrial building into the new headquarters of BandWith Chicago. Located at 134 S. California, the project site is located along S. California Ave stretching from W. Wilcox St down to W. Adams St. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the redevelopment will renovate the 21,460-square foot building into the headquarters of BandWith Chicago. The organization provides educational, rehearsal and performance spaces for music and dance students enrolled in their programs. The renovation will also include retail space for Dark Matter Coffee and separate administrative offices for Deborah’s Place, an organization which provides social services to homeless women. The approximately $12.4 million development will be funded with $2.5 million in grants, $1.3 million in debt from Wintrust Bank, $1.8 million from a capital campaign, $1.85 million in New Market Tax Credits, and $5 million in TIF funding. 50% of the TIF funding from the city would be paid out upon completion of the project, with the final 50% paid out one year after the completion of the development. With the Community Development Commission’s approval, the redevelopment agreement that outlines the proposed TIF funding will be finalized before moving to City Hall to get a final approval from City Council. If approved, construction would begin in March 2024 and be completed in January 2025.  ",East Garfield Park
Final landmark recommendation approved for 2678 W. Washington,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the house and dormitory at 2678 W. Washington. The property at 2678 W. Washington includes a large residential building with an attached dormitory and a free-standing coach house set on a large lot in East Garfield Park. The house is a fine example of Queen Anne architecture, and the attached dormitory was designed by the noted Chicago architecture firm of Holabird & Roche.

Set to rise 38 feet tall, the new mixed-use building will stand three stories tall and be clad in brick masonry. On the ground floor, 5,600 square feet of retail space will be occupied by administrative offices for a book publishing company. The upper two floors will have 8 two-bedroom apartments, accessed via the residential entry on S. Francisco Ave. The project will have zero car parking spaces and provide at least eight bike parking spaces. With City Council approval, the site will be rezoned from RT-4 to C1-3, allowing for the development to move forward. Permits for the new construction have not been filed yet and a timeline is currently unknown. ",East Garfield Park
Building permit issued for first phase of Garfield Green,"A full building permit has been issued for the first phase of the Garfield Green affordable housing development. Originally proposed as one of the submissions to the C40 Reinventing Cities competition in 2018, the venture led by POAH was selected as the winner in May 2019. The site is located at 3155 W. Fifth Ave, fronting both S. Kedzie Ave and W. Fifth Ave.  Garfield Green will be a carbon-neutral multifamily housing development that will bring a total of 82 units of affordable rental and for-sale housing stock to the East Garfield Park neighborhood. The mixed-use buildings will feature ground floor retail and commercial space fronting S. Kedzie Ave, with residential units setback from the street. The first building, planned for the southern parcel on the south side of W. 5th Ave, will deliver 43 rental units, including a unit mix of 15 one-beds, 19 two-beds, and 9 three-bedroom units. The affordable units will utilize an income-averaging plan, with some units at 30% AMI, 60% AMI, and 80% AMI. 11 of the units will have an additional subsidy from the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund. 4,500 square feet of commercial space will front S. Kedzie Ave. Residential amenities will include terraces, an exercise room, community room, rooftop gardening boxes, and 15 parking spaces. With a design from Perkins & Will and Nia Architects, the phase 1 building will be a three-story structure built of wood and steel frame construction. Roofs and walls will be well-insulated with high-performing insulated glass windows to achieve Passive House status. Green roofs will aid in cooling and allow for enhanced stormwater absorption. The building’s orientation has been designed to maximize solar heat gain for natural heating and cooling. With permits issued, the construction of this project can finally commence over four years after its conception. Skender and Ashlaur Construction will create a joint venture for leading the construction of the building. ",East Garfield Park
Committee on Design reviews Hub 32,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the mixed-use eTOD dubbed Hub 32. Recently announced as the winner of the East Garfield Park RFQ, the winning design will occupy a currently vacant parcel owned by the city at 132 N. Kedzie. The $47.2 million project is being planned by The Michaels Organization, KMW Communities, and TruDelta. Hub32 looks to connect to the surrounding neighborhood through community wealth building and by creating a place for local entrepreneurs to thrive. With Brooks + Scarpa working in collaboration with Studio Dwell Architects, the architecture is inspired by the idea of a quilt, taking pieces or aspects of the community and stitching them together. Designed as a set of buildings within a building, the broken-down scale fits the community using a fresh perspective on a typical courtyard-style building. The design maximizes daylight and views while providing a large common green space.   Set to rise seven floors, the mixed-use building will include 63 apartments for those earning up to 60% AMI. The rental units will be broken down into 14 one-beds, 34 two-beds, and 15 three-beds. The ground floor will include 5,600 square feet of retail space for three smaller tenants, prioritizing small food-based businesses rather than a large, big box retailer. A plaza will be designed to offer space for outdoor dining and community gathering, with the development also including 16 parking spaces. Retail tenants are expected to include Jerky Jerk Caribbean restaurant and Vietfive Coffee. The building’s massing will comprise of a taller element along the L tracks and a shorter volume along the south side of the site. Separated by a courtyard, the outdoor space will reinforce the courtyard building motif, with additional private terraces carving the massing. To add richness and depth to the building, the facades have been designed with inset windows and outset frames. The material palette of the project will clad the southern volume and base in a light-colored brick, while the taller tower element will be clad in metal paneling with inset accent panels mimicking wood. At the ground floor, the south corner has been carved out to create a community space, while the remainder of the N. Kedzie Ave frontage will be clad in storefront glazing to activate the street. Two small retail spaces will look onto the outdoor community space, with the residential entry located midway along the street frontage. A bike room and the final retail space will round out the rest of the project’s street frontage along N. Kedzie Ave. The discussion kicked off with Reed Kroloff who first asked whether the south building has an elevator to get to the upper floors. The design team responded that there needs to be one and they are resolving circulation and exiting issues. Kroloff then questioned whether the design is getting to a point where there are too many materials, wondering if the project could benefit from a less active material palette to enhance the contrast between volumes. The design team responded that a lot will be refined and changed as the design progresses and the budget will be considered as it applies to materials on the building. Catherine Baker chimed in next, wondering if the design team could switch around the programs on the ground floor to activate the north corner of the site along W. Lake St. Baker also questioned whether there could be an opportunity to activate W. Maypole Ave which is currently an odd, neglected street. The design team responded that they certainly want to activate W. Maypole Ave and are working every way they can to do that. The developers chimed in to discuss the fact that they feel they cannot activate all of these street frontages at once and are focusing on N. Kedzie Ave to activate the commercial street and intersection at the south end of the site. Andre Brumfield spoke next, commending them on a very good-looking building and creating an icon for the neighborhood. Brumfield asked how far the overhang of the northern tower is, saying that it seemed extreme and like an engineering feat. The design team responded that they have been working very quickly and expect changes going forward while trying to maintain the design intent.  Jackie Koo commented next, reinforcing the idea that the design should embrace W. Lake St and the L as an iconic part of Chicago. Koo suggested that the corner be activated with a community room or other programming to let people engage with the L. The developers responded that their design looks to use large north-facing windows to engage with the L by allowing residents to watch the trains going by. Currently there are a lot of low-rise industrial buildings along W. Lake St and they felt that retail under the L would be a great challenge they don't want to pursue.  Guacolda Reyes chimed in next to challenge the development team to bring energy to W. Lake St considering how important the L is for Chicago. Reinforcing the idea that it would be a missed opportunity without activation, Reyes suggested they change the bike room and add windows to create a welcoming space. Reyes’ final comment was that she worried about the type of materials and their cost in building this type of project. The design team responded that they have a track record of building affordable projects with materials that look too expensive and are very judicious about developing techniques in the design to get the most bang for their buck. The developers chimed in to say they know it will be an expensive project and will be looking to refine this preliminary plan in the next 4-6 months to reach a resolved project design and scope. Reed Kroloff jumped back in at the end to vouch for Brooks and Scarpa’s ability to budget and commented on how there would certainly be many ways to trim costs and still achieve the project’s design intent. Kroloff encouraged the developers to push the design and take on the challenge of the project for this site.    Moving forward, the development will continue through the city approval process. City support for the proposal may include Tax Increment Financing, tax credits, zoning, a land write-down, or other forms of assistance. Construction could start by early 2024.  ",East Garfield Park

DPD reveals East Garfield Park RFQ designs,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has revealed the three proposals competing in the East Garfield Park RFQ process. Produced by development and design teams that responded to a DPD Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in August 2022, the projects are vying for the chance to develop vacant, city-owned land at W. Lake St and N. Kedzie Ave. According to the RFP, the land consists of Sites 1, 2 and 3, each of which represent unique opportunities for the neighborhood. The parcels have the potential to create a well-integrated mixed-use development that enhances the vibrancy of the Garfield Park community as well as to implement eTOD principles that enable people the ability to experience the benefits of dense, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented development near transit hubs. The project will also expand retail, dining, and neighborhood amenities so that residents can access most of their basic, day-to-day needs within a 15-minute walk of their homes. As part of the process, design excellence is being promoted to ensure development is consistent with the unique context of neighborhood, corridors, and blocks. The first proposal comes from the development trifecta of The Michaels Organization, KMW Communities and TruDelta. Dubbed Hub32, the project looks to connect to the surrounding neighborhood through community wealth building and creating a place for local entrepreneurs to thrive. With Brooks + Scarpa working in collaboration with Studio Dwell Architects, the architecture is inspired by the idea of a quilt, taking pieces or aspects of the community and stitching them together. Designed as a set of buildings within a building, the broken-down scale fits the community using a fresh perspective on a typical courtyard-style building. The design maximizes daylight and views while providing a large common green space.   Set to rise seven floors, the mixed-use building will include 63 apartments for those earning up to 60% AMI. The rental units will be broken down into 14 one-beds, 34 two-beds, and 15 three-beds. The ground floor will include 5,600 square feet of retail space for three smaller tenants, prioritizing small food-based businesses rather than a large, big box retailer. A plaza will be designed to offer space for outdoor dining and community gathering, with the development also including 16 parking spaces. Watch their video here: Hub 32 -- The second proposal comes from solo developer Citizens Building a Better Community (CBBC). Designed by JGMA and Productora, the architecture looks to transform the entire intersection, envisioning a project that creates space for more than just housing. The architecture is based on two ideas, including the idea of the conservatory as a social space. Nurturing and promoting growth, the building features a central winter garden and lush atrium in place of the typical double-loaded corridor. Full of vegetation, it promotes social interaction as a green spine that connects from street level all the way up to the roof.  The second influence was the rich history of Garfield Park. Positing that contemporary architecture works best when it takes into account the local history, the facades have been designed with depth and movement that generates windows that are not just perpendicular to the street, but also diagonal. The upper floor sets back to reduce the overall height of the volume and the first floor is fully commercial space to promote an active street front. Working with landscape architects Botanical City, the project will include widened sidewalks and flexible corners with open space for people to gather, shop, and dine outdoors.  Set to rise six floors, the mixed-use building will include 52 residential units, broken down into 30 one-beds and 22 two-beds, all for those making up to 60% AMI. The ground floor will host 6,030 square feet of retail space for three tenants, potentially including a sit-down restaurant, laundromat, and cafe. Six parking spaces will be included.  Watch their video here: CBBC -- The final proposal comes from the partnership of Evergreen Real Estate Group and Imagine Development Group. Designed by Lorcan O'Herlihy Architects and HED Architects, the project seeks to be a bridge between the existing neighborhood and the vision of the area’s future. As an opportunity to engage with the neighborhood, the proposal looks to support community growth through place making architecture, enhancing the context and providing the best living spaces for residents.  The building’s massing rotates away from the train to separate it from the Green Line station, with green roof decks that are carved into the massing adding social space. Texture has been added to animate the facade, bringing the building into scale with the neighborhood. The project creates a landscaped street and buffer from the train, with widened sidewalks and an activated place to collect commuters, residents, and business patrons as they come from the Green Line.  Rising 7 floors, the mixed-use building will include 60 residential units, split into 36 one-beds, 18 two-bed, and 4 three-beds. The last two dwellings will be for-sale townhomes. Each residential floor will have a laundry room and lounge with direct access to the outdoors. A system of green roofs act as an amenity for the residents while reducing thermal transfer and increasing on-site water retention. A PV array on the roof will support 100% of the building's energy needs. The ground floor of the building will include 1,700 square feet of space for a local or start-up business as well as the public plaza adjacent to the CTA station entrance. Parking for 32 cars will also be provided.  Watch their video here: Evergreen/Imagine -- With DPD looking to engage the community and received feedback, you can take a survey here at this link: Community Survey DPD will likely hold a public meeting, with time and location to be determined.

Harrison Row Townhomes launch phase 2,"Structured Development has announced the launch of the second phase of Harrison Row Townhomes, an affordable for-sale townhome community at W. Harrison St and S. Francisco Ave in East Garfield Park. A total of 33 new three-bedroom townhomes will be added, including 14 duplex townhomes, or 28 units, built using modular construction. Priced from $245,000 and created under Chicago’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO), the homes will be built in phases over the course of the year and reserved for households earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income. Buyers will be sourced through the Chicago Community Land Trust (CCLT), a nonprofit corporation administered and staffed by the Chicago Department of Housing that seeks to preserve the long-term affordability of homes created through city of Chicago programs, including the ARO. Chicago-based Kinexx Modular Construction will assemble the modular townhomes off-site in its Southwest Side factory, significantly reducing the construction timeline for each home to approximately 90 days, including on-site installation. Kinexx is the first company to design, build and install a modular home in Chicago, with plans customized to the city’s typical lot size. Harrison Row is the first townhome application of the company’s modular designs. The idea to explore modular for Harrison Row’s second phase originated from Fain’s LLC, a Black-owned development firm based in East Garfield Park. Led by Kevin Brinson and Quentin “Q” Addison, who both grew up in the neighborhood, Fain’s originally specialized in renovations and other contracting work before shifting its focus to development. Following an introduction by 27th Ward Ald. Walter Burnett Jr., Fain’s began receiving mentorship from Structured Development on the first phase of Harrison Row and is now a partner on two of the units in phase two. As part of the ownership group, Fain’s will share in the fee revenues and profit and losses while gaining the foundation to develop projects independently in the future. Structured Development is fulfilling part of its ARO obligations for The Shops at Big Deahl, a mixed-use, mixed-income community the firm is developing at the southeast corner of Blackhawk and Kingsbury streets in Lincoln Park.   ",East Garfield Park

Epworth Church is officially a landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation for the Epworth Church building. Located at 5253 N. Kenmore, the church building has been formerly known as Epworth Methodist Episcopal Church and Epworth United Methodist Church. Constructed in 1891 by architect Frederick B. Townsend, the preliminary designation also includes the community house addition from 1931 from architects Thielbar and Fugard. The congregation no longer worships inside the church and the property is currently being marketed for sale. Meeting Criterion 1 for heritage, the Epworth Church building is a part of Edgewater’s history as it stood as a suburban scale church that was at home in the leafy retreat for Victorian-era Chicagoans that Edgewater was at the time. The land for the church was granted by John Cochran, the developer of Edgewater, and the design was donated by architect Frederick B. Townsend.  The church is also in compliance with Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Built as a very rare example of fieldstone architecture, the building is made up of large, uncoursed granite boulders that were shipped in from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The granite is left in its natural shape and exhibits a wide variety of color. The community house addition, built in 1931 for the church’s growing needs, combines granite fieldstone with cast stone walls that use concrete formwork to mimic carved stone. This was a new construction and material method at the time. The church building also meets Criterion 5 for being the work of a significant architect, in this case Fredrick B. Townsend, who has an extensive portfolio across the city including the Five Houses on Avers which is a landmark district. Criterion 7 is also met due to the unique and distinctive visual features that the church possesses in its exterior construction. Although the context surrounding the church has changed, the building itself has excellent physical integrity, meeting the integrity criterion. The only major changes include the community house addition and the narthex added to the front of the church at the same time as the addition.  Significant features of the building to be protected are all exterior elevations including rooflines of both the original church and the community house. With a developer planning to convert the church and community house into affordable apartments, landmarks staff have included flexibility into the designation that will allow for the alteration of the windows to meet light and ventilation requirements for dwelling units. With the landmark designation approved by the City Council, the building is fully protected from demolition. ",Edgewater

Growing Home plans $25 million expansion,"Local urban farm and workforce development nonprofit Growing Home is planning a $25 million expansion of their campus to increase access to fresh food, boost employment opportunities, and revitalize vacant land around their current facility in Englewood. Growing Home has operated the organic farm near 58th and Wood streets since 2009 and the neighboring Honore farm since 2011. Designed by UrbanWorks, the multi-million-dollar investment would increase the size of the non-profit’s farm, advance food production, and create more job training opportunities. The campus would occupy the currently vacant land at the corner of S. Wood St and W. 59th St that was donated to the organization. An approximately 30,000-square-foot building will house an organic produce processing facility, storefront, technology resource center, teaching kitchen, retail cafe, workforce development classrooms, commercial kitchen and office spaces. A 26,000-square-foot outdoor growing space will have a farm where neighbors can harvest their own crops. With an expanded processing facility three times the size of the current one, the project will include walk-in refrigeration, cold storage units, and open work areas giving them the space to store and process more food rather than wasting it. The organization also offers paid job-training opportunities and IT certification programs that help people earn more than a minimum wage with or without a college degree. The Englewood campus will have workforce development classrooms, community gathering spaces and a technology resource center. The nonprofit will use the space to double enrollment in the paid training program, which currently sits at about 80 people annually. To cover the $25 million project, Growing Home has been fundraising and has committed $13 million to the project. The city awarded a $5 million Housing and Economic Development bond to support the project in June. The nonprofit is aiming to break ground by next spring and open by Spring 2026. ",Englewood

The new paneling will use colors that match the existing glazed brick to blend in.  Residents and visitors will benefit from a newly landscaped site that includes a perimeter walking path, grilling areas, a playground, and community gathering space among the lush plantings. As part of the sustainability goals of the project, the building will be decarbonized and be fully electric, eliminating the need for gas in the building.  With a proposal to rezone the site from RS-3 to B2-2 with an overall Planned Development, the approval from the Chicago Plan Commission will allow the proposal to head to City Hall for approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. The $26.6 million development expects to close on the final financing package in the beginning of 2024 before commencing construction. ",Englewood

Englewood Nature Trail gets $20 million in funding,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot, U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and U.S. Congressman Danny Davis (D-IL-07) recently announced $20M in federal grant funding awarded to support the Englewood Nature Trail.  Poised to convert a 1.75-mile abandoned railway corridor into a grade-separated multi use path for walking and biking, the trail will not only revitalize a railway corridor that has been unused since the 1960s, but also serve as the spine of an urban agriculture district that occupies adjacent land, along with other productive uses. The long-term goals for the trail include connecting the surrounding area with safe and inviting park space and multi-use paths. “This equity-focused investment in the Englewood community will serve as a major catalyst for revitalization,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “The Englewood Nature Trail is both a physical connector and pathway to community connectivity and opportunity. The trail, which was importantly developed as part of a community-led process, will benefit Englewood residents for years to come.” The funding was awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) discretionary grant program to help communities carry out infrastructure and transportation projects with significant local or regional impact. The money will go towards the detailed design and construction of the trail, which is planned to run east to west along an elevated berm, starting near Hoyne Ave to the west and crossing over 26 viaducts on its way east towards Wallace St. There will be nine access points to the trail for the communities that it will pass through. As part of the citywide vision of trails and open spaces, the city is seeking both federal and local funding sources to support the completion of the Englewood Nature Trail project and will be working with community stakeholders in tandem with city departments including CDOT, DPD, and Chicago Park District.

Affordable apartments pitched for city-owned Englewood lot,"Ohio-based developer Keith B. Key Enterprises is looking to make its Chicago debut in the form of a new five-story mixed-income apartment building proposed for the corner of 61st and Halsted in the city's Englewood community. The project's $20.9 million first phase would rise on a vacant city-owned lot located roughly one block north of the neighborhood's Whole Foods, the Green Line stop at 63rd Street, and an upcoming ""eco-food hub"" and business incubator planned as part of the city's INVEST Sout/West initiative. The transit-oriented apartment development would include 56 mixed-income rental units and an off-street parking lot for 22 vehicles. A ground-floor space at the corner is set aside as retail or a community space, depending on market demand. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, Keith B. Key Enterprises is an MBE-certified real estate firm that specializes in mixed-income developments and has completed projects in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and New York. The Englewood proposal would be the company's first foray into the Illinois real estate market. ""As a minority developer, we are very interested in seeing how we can help communities where the people who live there look like us,"" said Tisha Germany, a vice president of Keith B. Key Enterprises, at Tuesday's meeting of the  Community Development Commission (CDC). ""This is a community and a city that we've been very interested in for probably 15 to 18 years now, so we're extremely excited for this to be our first project in Chicago.""  The Community Development Commission voted in favor of advertising the Department of Housing’s intention to enter into a negotiated sale with the developer. Once the 30-day public notice period has been served and if no alternative proposals are received, officials hope to introduce a measure to sell the property in July, pass City Council in September, and close on the transaction by the end of the year. Nine units in the new building will be reserved for residents earning 30 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), five units will go to residents making 50 percent AMI, and 26 units will be offered to Chicagoans with incomes at 60 percent AMI. The remaining 16 apartments will be rented at market rate. The project intends to use Low-Income Housing Tax Credits plus CHA vouchers for the units priced at 30 percent AMI.  The design of the proposed building comes from Cleveland-based RDL Architects, which is partnering with Chicago's Johnson & Lee Architects on the South Side project. A ""second phase"" mixed-use building is slated for the northern portion of the development site and will be reviewed at a later time.  ",Englewood

Fulton St and N. Racine Ave. The northern tower will have its residential lobby along W. Carroll Ave while the western tower’s residential lobby will be along W. Fulton St. Two separate bike rooms both on the ground floor will hold the planned 1,079 bike spaces for residents. Parking garage access will be from N. Racine Ave with loading access off of W. Carroll Ave. The entry into the fitness center tenant space will face into the public open space. Within the podium, the planned parking spaces will occupy space on the second and third floors, with 150 spaces planned for the fitness tenant and retail and the remaining 290 designated for tenants. During the community meeting, the developers expressed willingness to create public access to parking if there were unused spaces. Residential units will screen the parking along W. Carroll Ave and N. Racine Ave.  While the name of the fitness operator hasn’t been released, the 90,000 square feet of space it will occupy is located on the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors of the podium.

An outdoor deck will be included for the fitness tenant.  The podium will be topped with a residential amenity deck on the seventh floor with the residential towers rising above. The northern tower’s 521 units will be split into 193 studios, 255 one-beds, and 73 two-beds. The western tower’s 558 units will include a mix of 224 studios, 194 one-beds, and 140 two-beds. The development will meet the 20% affordability requirement with 216 of the rental apartments being set aside as affordable.  To meet sustainability requirements, the development will implement water use reduction, construction waste diversion, will exceed energy code by 5%, provide bike parking, plant trees, install over 50% green roofs, is located in proximity to transit, install EV charging stations, and install CTA digital displays. With approval from the Chicago City Council secured, the site will be rezoned from M2-3 to DX-7 with an overall Planned Development designation. A 4.5 FAR bonus would be added by paying approximately $9.7 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.  While a specific timeline for construction hasn’t been announced, the development team has split the project in a way that the two towers can be phased. If phasing was implemented, the northern tower and all commercial space in the building would be built first including the fitness tenant and the western tower would be added in a second phase.  ",Fulton Market

Within the podium, the planned parking spaces will occupy space on the second and third floors, with 150 spaces planned for the fitness tenant and retail and the remaining 290 designated for tenants. During the community meeting, the developers expressed willingness to create public access to parking if there were unused spaces. Residential units will screen the parking along W. Carroll Ave and N. Racine Ave.  While the name of the fitness operator hasn’t been released, the 90,000 square feet of space it will occupy is located on the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors of the podium. The scheme includes some residential units in the western tower on these floors as well. An outdoor deck will be included for the fitness tenant.  The podium will be topped with a residential amenity deck on the seventh floor with the residential towers rising above. The northern tower’s 521 units will be split into 193 studios, 255 one-beds, and 73 two-beds. The western tower’s 558 units will include a mix of 224 studios, 194 one-beds, and 140 two-beds. The development will meet the 20% affordability requirement with 216 of the rental apartments being set aside as affordable.  To meet sustainability requirements, the development will implement water use reduction, construction waste diversion, will exceed energy code by 5%, provide bike parking, plant trees, install over 50% green roofs, is located in proximity to transit, install EV charging stations, and install CTA digital displays. The Chicago Plan Commission approved the rezoning of the site from M2-3 to DX-7 with an overall Planned Development designation. A 4.5 FAR bonus would be added by paying approximately $9.7 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. The proposal will now go before the Committee on Zoning and City Council to secure final approvals. While a specific timeline for construction hasn’t been announced, the development team has split the project in a way that the two towers can be phased. If phasing was implemented, the northern tower and all commercial space in the building would be built first including the fitness tenant and the western tower would be added in a second phase.  ",Fulton Market
New renderings emerge for 370 N. Morgan,"A set of fresh renderings have been released showing the revised design for the new mixed-use development located at 370 N. Morgan. Planned by Vista Property Group, the development will be the first phase of their three-tower mixed-use development at the intersection of W. Kinzie St and N. Morgan St. The site is bound by W. Kinzie St to the north, N. Morgan St to the east, the Metra tracks to the south, and N. Carpenter St to the west. With Antunovich Associates in charge of the redesigned project, the renderings show the revised massing of the tower that was shortened by cutting the height by three floors and going from 410 feet down to 380 feet in height. The residential tower has been widened to stretch the entire width of the site, accommodating a similar unit count in a shorter massing. The building’s facade has been revised to use a dark metal and glass window wall system with brick wrapping the podium.  With a total count of 493 units, the apartments will be split into 154 efficiency units and 339 dwelling units. The parking count was reduced from 222 to 190 spaces and 80% of them will be electric-vehicle ready. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will face N. Morgan St with a metal canopy reaching out into the new landscaped plaza that occupies the corner and overlooks the intersection. Retail space will occupy the rest of the street frontage between the residential entry and the Metra tracks. Management and leasing offices will be located along Kinzie behind the lobby and a bike room with 494 spaces will occupy the rest of the Kinzie St frontage. Loading and parking access will be from N. Carpenter St.  With a demolition permit issued, work has already begun to clear the former Fox Deluxe building at 370 N. Morgan to make way for a new mixed-use development. With Skender Construction set to be the general contractor, new construction permits have been filed and are awaiting issuance. The developer is quoting a Q1 2025 start for construction.  ",Fulton Market
Demo permit issued to make way for 370 N. Morgan,"A demolition permit has been issued for the former Fox Deluxe building at 370 N. Morgan to make way for a new mixed-use development.

Kinzie St to the north, N. Morgan St to the east, the Metra tracks to the south, and N. Carpenter St to the west. With Antunovich Associates recently replacing Gensler as the architect, the 370 N. Morgan tower has undergone some slight modifications to its program and massing. With a split of 154 efficiency units and 339 dwelling units, the unit count has been increased by three from 492 to 495, while the parking count has been reduced from 222 to 190. 80% of the parking spaces will be electric-vehicle ready instead of 100%. The massing of the tower has been shortened by cutting the height by three floors and going from 410 feet down to 380 feet in height. While the podium has largely remained the same, the residential tower has been widened to stretch the entire width of the site, accommodating the similar unit count in a shorter massing. The building’s facade has been revised to use dark metal paneling and slab edge covers and the podium will use acid etched glass instead of fritted glass with perforated metal paneling around the parking floors. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will remain overlooking the intersection of Kinzie and Morgan, with a retail space occupying the rest of the N. Morgan St frontage. A new landscaped plaza will front both spaces overlooking the intersection. In lieu of more retail space along W. Kinzie St, the revised plan will locate management and leasing offices along Kinzie behind the lobby and a bike room with 494 spaces will occupy the rest of the Kinzie St frontage. Loading and parking access will remain from N. Carpenter St.  With the demolition permit issued, demolition contractor Heneghan Wrecking & Excavating can clear the property to make way for the new development.

City Council approves two-tower development at 170 N. May and 175 N. Racine,"The Chicago City Council has approved LG Group’s revised plans for a two-tower mixed-use development at 170 N. May and 175 N. Racine. The former Amylu Foods project site is an L-shaped parcel bound by W. Lake St, N. May St, W. Randolph St, and N. Racine Ave, with two buildings at the corner of W. Randolph St and N. Racine Ave not included in this parcel.  Originally approved back in 2021, the previous design by Gensler, called for one 29-story tower that would have risen 330 feet tall. Holding 486 apartments, the building would have held retail space on the ground floor and 261 parking spaces.  With bKL Architecture on board for the new version, the site will become home to two residential towers. Rising along N. May St, the first phase tower at 170 N. May would be the shorter of the two, standing 25 stories tall reaching 315 feet in height. The smaller building would have 287 dwelling units, 252 parking spaces, and 287 bike parking spaces.  The second phase of the project would see the construction of a 38-story tower reaching 450 feet in height at 175 N. Racine. Rising at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Racine Ave, the building would have 380 residential units, 257 parking spaces, and 380 bike parking spaces. The overall development will satisfy the ARO requirements by providing 133 affordable units across the two buildings. On the ground floor, the residential entry for Phase 1 would be midblock on N. May St with some retail space at the corner of W. Lake St and N. May St. A large retail space would occupy all the ground floor south of the midblock alley towards the corner of W. Randolph St and N. May St. Phase 2 would have its residential lobby along N. Racine Ave, with retail space at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Racine Ave. The bike room would be located along W. Lake St, with loading and parking access for both buildings from the midblock alley connection.  The design sculpts the buildings with staggered setbacks that step back from W. Randolph St to push the density up toward W. Lake St while still keeping setbacks from the noise of the L tracks. The very long podium facade along N. May St is broken down with a brick design for the grocer and portion down to W. Randolph St, with the tower facade coming down to the ground midblock to the residential entry. The northern portion uses a metal facade on the podium instead of brick to reference the industrial qualities seen in the metal L track structures. With Confluence serving as the landscape architect, the design will reclaim some of the angled parking along W. Randolph St for more space for plantings as well as an opportunity for outdoor seating. Curb bump outs will be added along W. Randolph St and W. Lake St. Seating elements with planters will be included along the L tracks.  With approvals secured, the site’s existing Planned Development will be amended to allow for the revised $300 million development. With a grocer interested in the space, LG Group intends to start Phase 1 as soon as Spring 2025 and will build the second phase after the first building is completed.  ",Fulton Market

Sterling Bay and Wheelock Street Capital Sell Hyatt House-Fulton Market,"Sterling Bay and Wheelock Street Capital have announced the sale of Hyatt House-Fulton Market to Ohio-based Rockbridge Capital. Located at 105 N. May in the Fulton Market neighborhood, the 200-key, extended-stay hotel includes 5,224 square-feet of retail space on the ground floor, which is now fully leased to popular breakfast restaurant The Original Pancake House. “Hyatt House was an exciting and important development for Fulton Market, and we are pleased to see the property fully leased before the sale,” said Andy Gloor, CEO of Sterling Bay. “Our ability, in close partnership with Wheelock, to successfully take such a project from construction to financing, leasing and sale is a testament to our team’s incredible track record in commercial property development.”  This sale is the latest activity in a series of Fulton Market listings for the firm, which has identified the properties as opportunities to further their vision for development in Chicago.  The Original Pancake House will operate its sixth Chicagoland location—and first in Fulton Market—in the ground floor retail space at Hyatt House, bringing an accessible, family-friendly breakfast option to Fulton Market’s bustling dining scene. The restaurant plans to open in late spring or early summer 2025.  Since Sterling Bay and Wheelock delivered Hyatt House in 2019, the 200-key property has been the only extended-stay and Hyatt-branded hotel in the neighborhood. Designed by Eckenhoff Saunders Architects, the hotel has welcomed thousands of guests looking to take advantage of Fulton Market’s range of business, dining and entertainment offerings. Hyatt House builds on the neighborhood’s live-work-play environment with its own amenities, including an indoor rooftop pool, sky deck with expansive city views, fitness center, and full-service lobby bar.

City Council approves mixed-use development at 345 N. Aberdeen,"The Chicago City Council has approved Sterling Bay’s plan for a mixed-use development at 345 N. Aberdeen. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the project site is a full-block lot bound by N. Carpenter St to the east, W. Carroll Ave to the south, N. Aberdeen St to the west, and the Metra tracks to the north.  Designed by Gensler, the new development will stand 473 feet tall over 44 floors, with 559 residential units, 20% or 112 of which will be set aside as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. The building will also provide 255 parking spaces and 559 bike parking spaces. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will occupy the southeastern corner of the building, facing the corner of W. Carroll Ave and N. Carpenter St. The building’s 10,000 square feet of retail space will face the corner of W. Carroll Ave and N. Aberdeen St. Mechanical space will stretch along the north side of the ground floor along the tracks, with loading fronting N. Carpenter St and the parking access from N. Aberdeen St.  After studying a few iterations of the building's massing, the north/south oriented bar building was selected. The building was shifted to the east to open up some public space along the western side of the property and the tower’s massing was evolved to create a more vertical expression and break up the length of the facade. Along W. Carroll Ave, the tower expression reaches down to the ground to announce the residential entry. Topping out at 473 feet tall, the building’s facade will be made up of a metal and glass window wall on the tower and a brick expression on the podium.  With the zoning change approved, the property will be rezoned from M2-3 to DX-7 with a Planned Development designation. A 4.5 FAR bonus would also be secured by paying approximately $5 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. At the same time, Sterling Bay is looking to sell the property. During the previous community meeting, a representative from the development team commented that all options are on the table for developing the site and they would be open to a joint venture or collaboration to facilitate the development.

Construction tops out at 919 W. Fulton,"Skender recently celebrated the topping out of the structure for 919 W. Fulton, an 11-story, 409,000-square-foot-mixed-use office building. Located at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Sangamon St, the project is being developed by Fulton Street Companies and JDL Development. Financial backing for the project was secured through strategic partnerships with Bank OZK and Manulife Investment Management. SNK Capital assumed the pivotal role as the lead equity investment partner. Designed by Morris Adjmi Architects and FitzGerald, the 400,000 square foot mixed-use building is set to become home to the headquarters of Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, who will occupy 112,000 square feet of space in the 11-story building. On the ground floor, Gibsons Restaurant Group will occupy 15,500 square feet of the planned retail space.  Once completed, the amenity-rich development will feature floor-to-ceiling windows, several outdoor terraces, a rooftop lounge and bar, several conference and coworking spaces, and a state-of-the-art fitness center for tenants to enjoy. A full-depth, nearly football field-sized basement will provide parking for up to 80 vehicles, a ComEd vault and space for the building’s mechanical equipment. The building will have two main lobbies, one on Sangamon and one corridor that will connect access between Fulton and Lake. Upon completion, the building’s address will be changed to 217 N Sangamon. The project puts a deep focus on air quality, material selection, energy efficiency, wellness and environmental impact, as the building is pursuing WELL and LEED Silver certifications.

Revised scheme revealed for mixed-use development at 23 S. Sangamon,"Developers Fern Hill and Free Market Ventures have announced a revised scheme for their mixed-use development at 23 S. Sangamon. Located at the northeastern corner of S. Sangamon St and W. Monroe St, the developers most recently planned a 19-story condominium tower that was approved back in 2021. With Eckenhoff Saunders and Interactive Design Architects designing the project, the new design calls for a three-story community center and fieldhouse with racket and basketball facilities topped by a residential building with 283 residential units and 73 car parking spaces. Rising 357 feet tall, the 33-story tower would include 57 affordable residential units, representing the required 20% affordability by the ARO. The three-story community center fronting Bartelme Park will be entirely privately funded but accessible to the public at no cost through a newly formed 501(c)3 non-profit operator. The new, privately funded facilities will provide many of the resources and programs that have been consistently requested by many voices in the community through an unrelated, but similar, public process to establish a publicly funded Chicago Park District fieldhouse for the neighboring Skinner Park. The community center has capacity to include a reception cafe, open public lounge, restrooms, family changing rooms, flexible event/exhibition space, large group events, indoor movie nights, study rooms, outdoor seating, and storage. The fieldhouse has space to support active and healthy lifestyles with a full-size basketball court and multiple racket sports including separate pickleball and paddle tennis facilities, convenient restroom and locker room amenities, and a 125-foot-long tree-top terrace overlooking Bartelme Park to the south. “The development team is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with community, aldermanic, and City leadership and staff, to grow tax revenues while offering a more inclusive and equitable neighborhood vision that leverages a unique public-private partnership model to deliver unrivaled community benefits supporting Mary Bartelme Park and the entire West Loop Community,” said Nick Anderson, President of Fern Hill, in a statement. The developers have submitted the zoning application to the city to amend the existing Planned Development, triggering a zoning process that will include review by the community, alderman, and Chicago Department of Planning and Development. Approvals will be needed from local Alderman Conway, the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the City Council. ",Fulton Market

A 4.5 FAR bonus would be added by paying approximately $9 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. The developers are hoping to proceed to the Chicago Plan Commission for approval in August of this year and proceed with approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.  During the meeting, Jim Letchinger from JDL stated that they are prepared to start construction as soon as they can, but acknowledged the complex financial climate that makes financing projects difficult. The team has considered phasing the project to allow it to begin construction sooner. If phasing was implemented, the northern tower and all commercial space in the building would be built first including the fitness tenant and the western tower would be added in a second phase.  ",Fulton Market

PRC approves mixed-use rehab at 900 W. Fulton,"The Permit Review Committee has approved a mixed-use rehab planned at 900 W. Fulton. Planned by Midwest Property Group LTD, the project site is located at the northwest corner of the intersection of W. Fulton Market and N. Peoria St. Designed by NORR, the project would rehabilitate, demolish, and rebuild three structures as part one combined development. The four-story contributing structure at 900 W. Fulton on the corner will be rehabbed and renovated, with a new retail storefront and a residential entry along N. Peoria St.  The one and two-story structure at 906 W. Fulton will be demolished and replaced by a five-story mixed-use structure. The building’s design has a four-story brick facade along the street wall with a fifth-floor addition setback 10 feet from the street and clad in metal paneling.  The third portion of the project is the contributing building at 910 W. Fulton. As part of the development, the front facade will be restored while the structure behind will be demolished due to its deteriorated condition. The new reconstruction behind will fill out the first two floors with the third-floor setback 15 feet from the street above the historic facade. With approval secured from the Permit Review Committee, the project can move forward with permitting and construction. A timeline for the project is currently unknown and no permits have been filed.  ",Fulton Market
Renders emerge for mixed-use development at 170 N. May and 175 N. Racine,"Developer LG Group recently presented their revised plans for a two-tower mixed-use development at 170 N. May and 175 N. Racine. The former Amylu Foods project site is an L-shaped parcel bound by W. Lake St, N. May St, W. Randolph St, and N. Racine Ave, with two buildings at the corner of W. Randolph St and N. Racine Ave not included in this parcel.  Originally approved back in 2021, the previous design by Gensler, called for one 29-story tower that would have risen 330 feet tall. Holding 486 apartments, the building would have held retail space on the ground floor and 261 parking spaces.  With bKL Architecture on board for the new version, the site will become home to two residential towers. Rising along N. May St, the first phase tower at 170 N. May would be the shorter of the two, standing 25 stories tall reaching 315 feet in height. The smaller building would have 287 dwelling units, 252 parking spaces, and 287 bike parking spaces.  The second phase of the project would see the construction of a 38-story tower reaching 450 feet in height at 175 N. Racine. Rising at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Racine Ave, the building would have 380 residential units, 257 parking spaces, and 380 bike parking spaces. The overall development will satisfy the ARO requirements by providing 133 affordable units across the two buildings. On the ground floor, the residential entry for Phase 1 would be midblock on N. May St with some retail space at the corner of W. Lake St and N. May St. A large retail space would occupy all the ground floor south of the midblock alley towards the corner of W. Randolph St and N. May St. Phase 2 would have its residential lobby along N. Racine Ave, with retail space at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Racine Ave. The bike room would be located along W. Lake St, with loading and parking access for both buildings from the midblock alley connection.  The design sculpts the buildings with staggered setbacks that step back from W. Randolph St to push the density up toward W. Lake St while still keeping setbacks from the noise of the L tracks. The very long podium facade along N. May St is broken down with a brick design for the grocer and portion down to W. Randolph St, with the tower facade coming down to the ground midblock to the residential entry. The northern portion uses a metal facade on the podium instead of brick to reference the industrial qualities seen in the metal L track structures. With Confluence serving as the landscape architect, the design will reclaim some of the angled parking along W. Randolph St for more space for plantings as well as an opportunity for outdoor seating. Curb bump outs will be added along W. Randolph St and W. Lake St. Seating elements with planters will be included along the L tracks.  With the zoning application already introduced, the proposal will undergo review as the developer seeks to push ahead. Approvals will be needed from Alderman Burnett, the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council. With a grocer interested in the space, LG Group intends to start Phase 1 as soon as Spring 2025 and will build the second phase after the first building is completed.  ",Fulton Market

Residents begin moving in at Cassidy on Canal,"Habitat has announced that its first residents have moved in at Cassidy on Canal, a new 33-story, 343-unit residential tower at 350 N. Canal in the Fulton River District. Developed by Habitat and Diversified Real Estate Capital, LLC, the building was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and built by general contractor McHugh Construction.  “It’s not every day an apartment tower of this magnitude opens near the west bank of the Chicago River in this neighborhood,” said Habitat President Matt Fiascone. “In fact, it’s been almost two decades since renters had an opportunity to move into a new building so close to this side of the river. I’m not sure who was more excited the day Cassidy on Canal opened its doors – us, or its residents.” Cassidy on Canal offers a mix of studio, one-, two-bedroom and Penthouse Collection units; parking for 123 vehicles; and ground floor retail. A robust amenity package is highlighted by a sweeping 10,000-square-foot outdoor deck off the building’s fifth floor with landscaped grounds, a pool, lounge seating, fire pits, grilling areas, cool weather heaters and dining areas. Inside, residents will be able to enjoy a fitness center with practice studios, a game room, various club rooms, a coworking center and a rejuvenating spa with a steam room and sauna. A pet-friendly building, Cassidy on Canal also includes an extensive outdoor dog run, scheduled to open in the coming months. Rents at the building range from $2,550 to $5,660 for studios, one- and two-bedrooms with the Penthouse Collection renting for up to $10,810 per month. Units span in size from 515 to 1,988 square feet. In-unit features include state-of-the-art kitchens with quartz countertops, graphite backsplashes, stainless steel appliances and two-toned designer kitchen cabinetry; pinecone oak flooring throughout; floor-to-ceiling windows, with many apartments having views of the skyline and Chicago River; stacked in-unit washer and dryer; smart thermostats; keyless entry; and outdoor balconies in select units. Cassidy on Canal’s Penthouse Collection comprises floors 31-33, presenting exclusive amenities and unobstructed city views. Offering expansive layouts, the Penthouse Collection floor plans have unique features throughout, including walk-in closets with laminate shelving and photo-sensor lighting; remote app-controlled light switches in living, dining and kitchen areas; kitchen islands; illuminated bathroom mirrors with recessed downlights above the sinks; full-size washer and dryer; and large terraces or balconies off most units.

Habitat begins pre-leasing at Cassidy on Canal,"Habitat and joint venture partner Diversified Real Estate Capital have announced that pre-leasing is underway for Cassidy on Canal, a new 33-story, 343-unit mixed-use development at 350 N. Canal. Located on the west side of N. Canal St between W. Kinzie St and W. Fulton St, the property was formerly home to the Cassidy Tire building. “Cassidy on Canal brings the best Chicago has to offer right to its doorstep with its proximity to the riverwalk and the numerous businesses, restaurants and entertainment options of the Loop, Fulton Market and River North areas,” said Habitat President Matt Fiascone. “Compared to the higher density of Fulton Market to the west, Cassidy is nestled in this protected sweet spot with the river to one side and train lines to the other, filling a void in the immediate neighborhood for a modern, highly-amenitized rental option. We couldn’t be happier to welcome our first residents to their new homes in the months ahead.”    Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the 33-story tower reaches 375 feet tall with 343 residential units, approximately 1,300 square feet of ground floor retail space, 123 parking spaces, and a host of amenities for future residents. The building features a large 10,000-square-foot outdoor deck on the building’s fifth floor, with landscaped grounds, a pool, lounge seating, fire pits, grilling areas, cool weather heaters and dining areas. Inside, residents will be able to enjoy a fitness center with practice studios, game room, various club rooms, coworking center, and a spa with sauna, steam and whirlpool rooms.

Urbanize tours Cassidy on Canal,"Urbanize recently visited the construction site of Cassidy on Canal, a mixed-use development at 350 N. Canal. Located on the west side of N. Canal St, between W. Kinzie St and W. Fulton St, the site was formerly home to the Cassidy Tire building. Developed by The Habitat Company and Diversified Real Estate Capital LLC, the new 33-story tower was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz to stand 356 feet tall with 343 rental apartments inside. Led by McHugh Construction, we began the tour by taking the skip up to the roof. With a pretty clear day, there were expansive views of the West Loop to the west and River North to the northeast and beyond. The roof will not be accessible to residents and is home to large mechanical units for the building. Heading down into the tower, the 33rd floor is the highest occupiable floor in the building. This floor and the two below will hold the building’s penthouse units. The tower’s glazing has been fully installed all the way up to these highest floors and crews are working on the mechanical rough ins on these floors. Working our way down the building, our next stop was the 25th floor. Here crews were framing in the units, which was the first time where you could start to see the different units taking shape and splitting up the overall floor plate.  Stopping next on the 19th floor, here crews have gotten drywall installed, but not mudded and taped. The addition of drywall helps define rooms and units more clearly without finishes installed yet. Our next stop was the sixth floor, where flooring and cabinetry have been installed. These units begin to look more finished and can give a good impression of what finished units will eventually look like when all the final touches are completed. Heading down one more level, the fifth floor will be fully amenity space, with outdoor decks on top of the parking podium. The south deck has an outdoor pool as well as grilling stations and spaces for cabana framed by planters. The amenity deck will wrap around the west side of the building towards another outdoor deck on the north side which will hold more grilling stations and seating opportunities with planters. Inside, there will be coworking spaces, a fitness center, and resident lounge. Our final stop was the building’s lobby, which is still a raw space that is being framed in. A motor court outside will offer space for pickups and drop-offs within the site boundary off of the street.  With the building topped off and enclosed since our last visit, general contractor McHugh Construction is making rapid progress on the building. The first occupancy of the lower 20 floors is expected in Spring 2024 with full turnover planned in Summer 2024. ",Fulton River District
Developer looks to sell development site at 527 W. Kinzie,"Vornado Realty Trust is looking to sell their development site at 527 W. Kinzie. Located near the Chicago River in the Fulton River District, the piece of land sits at the southwest corner of W. Kinzie St and N. Canal St. The developer had been planning a 26-story residential tower designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners. The 290 foot-tall structure would have contained 288 residential units, while providing 81 car parking spaces. The unit mix would have had 35 studios, 35 convertibles, 108 1-beds, 38 2-beds, and 12 3-bedroom configurations.  With CBRE brokers hired to lead the sale of the surface parking lot, the move comes as developer The Habitat Company wraps up construction on their development at 350 N. Canal next door to the south which will provide 343 units in a 33-story building.  Vornado has owned the site since 1998 and the site’s most recent progress was in January 2022 when the 26-story residential tower scheme was announced via Alderman Reilly’s newsletter to constituents.  According to reports from CoStar, it's unclear why Vornado has decided to offload the site instead of moving ahead and a sale price has not been listed.  ",Fulton River District
Urbanize tours Cassidy on Canal,"Urbanize recently toured the construction site for Cassidy on Canal, a mixed-use development at 350 N. Canal. Located on the west side of N. Canal St, between W.

Developed by The Habitat Company and Diversified Real Estate Capital LLC, the new 33-story tower was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz to stand 356 feet tall and hold 343 apartments. Led by McHugh Construction and The Habitat Company, our tour began by taking the skip to the 14th floor. With McHugh Concrete on the job, crews had just poured the 19th floor and were setting the formwork for the 20th level. On the 14th floor, mechanicals installation has begun, and pole shores are out of the space. As a typical residential floor, it will have 13 units and the concrete ceilings will get a skim coat finish. Heading down the building, our next stop was the 8th floor. On this floor, workers had begun the installation of the sills for the window wall system. Crews have also outlined where the wall framing will go with chalk on the floors. The next stop on the walkthrough was the 5th floor. Planned to be an amenity floor, glass installation has begun on this level. The east and north facades have the glass installed while the west and south-facing walls have yet to receive glass. The interior amenity offerings will include a steam room and sauna, club room with lounge and kitchen, coworking spaces, a game room, restrooms and shower for the pool and sauna, and a fitness center on the east side that overlooks the street. The north-facing roof deck is currently being used to tie the rebar cages for the tower’s columns but will eventually be home to fire pits and grill stations. The south-facing deck will be home to the outdoor pool and is currently being used for staging and storage of supplies.  The last stop of the tour was down back at the ground floor. Approximately 1,300 square feet of retail space will front N. Canal St, while the residential lobby will face north to a drop-off loop that comes off the street. The tower crane is currently placed in a spot that will get a fountain when the project is completed. With McHugh Concrete and McHugh Construction working on the building, the concrete structure should top out mid-summer, with the glass enclosure wrapping up by the end of the year. The first occupancy of the lower 20 floors is set for February 2024 with substantial completion scheduled for the end of Summer 2024. ",Fulton River District

Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the new 33-story mixed-use tower will offer 343 new luxury apartments in addition to 1,313 square feet of retail space. Broken down into a mix of studio, one-bed, and two-bed units, renters will have access to a full package of amenities on the building’s fifth floor. Amenity spaces will include a fitness center, game room, club rooms, coworking center, spa with sauna, steam and whirlpool rooms, swimming pool with cabanas, a north and south sun deck, grilling area, fire pits, cool weather heaters, and dining areas on each deck surrounded by lush landscaping.  “To honor the location’s rich history, it was important to us to bring this neighborhood a new development that stands out through its forward-looking design and modern conveniences, yet also pays homage to the site’s legacy by keeping the Cassidy family name,” said Habitat President Matt Fiascone.  Located on the west side of Canal Street, between Kinzie and Fulton streets, the 350 N. Canal site was formerly home to the Cassidy Tire building. Habitat plans to integrate some of the property’s original bricks into the build out of the new community. The site’s location should also appeal to a wide range of renters, given its proximity to several L, bus and Metra lines, plus its high walkability to the numerous business, restaurants and entertainment options of the Loop, Fulton Market and River North. “We’re dedicated to investing in vibrant urban locations nationally and partnering with the best local developers like The Habitat Company who have the vision and wealth of experience to bring neighborhood-changing projects to reality,” said Jeff Cherner, executive vice president, Diversified Real Estate Capital, LLC.  With McHugh Construction serving as the general contractor, caisson work was actively underway during the ceremony, creating a very active site during the festivities.

Fulton River District tower begins skyward climb,"Three months have passed since Vancouver-based developer Onni Group broke ground on a rental high-rise at 354 N. Union Avenue in Chicago's Fulton River District. This week the 33-story project is ready to go vertical. Crews recently framed the base of the concrete structure's core and installed the stub for the soon-to-arrive tower crane. The downtown project also recently received a full building permit (it got its foundation permit back in March 2020). The latest permit estimates the scope of the work at $99.6 million and lists Onni Contracting as the general contractor.  Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the tower at 354 N. Union replaces a longtime vacant lot between two rail right-of-ways. The completed building will deliver 373 luxury rentals offered in studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom layouts ranging in size from 400 to 1,600 square feet. The project also includes a 143-car parking podium, a pool deck for residents, and a dog park that will be open to the public during the day.  Onni Group is also behind the three-tower Old Town Park rental development as well as the recently completed apartment tower at 369 W. Grand. The developer is currently seeking city approval for its largest Chicago project yet: a five-tower, 2,650-unit development on the southern tip of Goose Island known as Halsted Point.   ",Fulton River District
Developer envisions 'habitable billboard' and park atop the Kennedy Expressway,"A Chicago developer has set its sights on transforming a parking lot on top of the Kennedy Expressway into a one-of-a-kind ""experiential"" retail space and a park-like pedestrian connection between the Fulton Market and Fulton River districts. R2 Companies is hoping to attract a well-known brand or benefactor to create what it calls a ""habitable billboard."" The plan calls for a low-density building of up to 12,500 square feet and conceals on-site parking beneath a green roof that will step up and connect to the Halsted Street viaduct. Matt Garrison of R2, which purchased the lot at 708 W. Wayman Street in 2016, says he believes such a project will create a unique win-win situation for both the city and whatever company decides to set up shop at the site.  A brand or retailer will benefit from the location's high visibility along I-94, which boasts traffic counts of over 100 million cars per year, according to a marketing flyer for the property. ""It's like the old Lasalle Bank or Wintrust mural building, but better,"" Garrison said. ""It's more visible, surrounded by a park, and your brand can live in it."" For the city and local residents, there's a chance to create publicly accessible open space in an area of the city where land costs make new parkland prohibitive. ""Rather than build another giant apartment or office tower, we can create a public greenway that connects the entrance to Fulton Market across the highway,"" said Garrison. Renderings of R2's vision show a glassy cube-shaped building hovering on stilt-like legs. Created in collaboration with global architecture firm Gensler, these images are still conceptual and R2 plans to release several other ""low density"" concepts in the near future, Garrison said. R2's proposal is visually reminiscent of a long-discussed idea to cap the Kennedy Expressway with new park space. Although the concept was first explored in a 2003 draft of the city’s Central Area Plan, the Kennedy cap has yet to move forward in a meaningful way. ""Capping the Kennedy is a noble pursuit and we hope it happens someday,"" Garrison told Urbanize. ""Here, the Kennedy is already capped, and R2 owns it. This is an opportunity to make something happen. If we think outside the box, we can privately fund a major public benefit here."" The flyer for 708 W. Wayman suggests the unusual development could be delivered in 2023. For that to happen, however, Garrison says community stakeholders and government officials will need to get on board.

33-story apartment tower breaks ground in Fulton River District ,"As Onni Group wraps up construction on one downtown apartment tower, the Vancouver-based developer is starting work on another rental high-rise at 354 N. Union Avenue. Crews and foundation equipment are on-site and already preparing the vacant Fulton River District lot for an upcoming 33-story building with 373 luxury apartments and 143 parking spaces. Designed by Chicago architecture firm Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the project at 354 N. Union will rise roughly 400 feet and includes an outdoor amenity deck west of the tower as well as a driveway connecting to North Halsted Street. A 2018 rendering of the building also shows a pedestrian bridge between the new development and the Jewel supermarket to the east. Onni says it's still waiting on a more recent and polished image of the project, and we'll update this post when they send it over. Construction on 354 N. Union Avenue is kicking off more than one year after it received its first building permit from the city, Curbed Chicago (RIP) reported at the time. This week's groundbreaking is another sign that developers are betting on the strength of downtown's apartment market post-pandemic.  The new building is expected to take approximately two years to complete, according to a construction update from the office of 42nd Ward Ald. Brendan Reilly.    ",Fulton River District

LeClaire Courts redevelopment receives $27 million CHA loan,"Habitat and Cabrera Capital Partners recently announced the approval of a $27 million capital loan from the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) for the first phase of residential redevelopment of LeClaire Courts on the city’s Southwest Side. The 32-acre site, bounded by Cicero Avenue to the east, 45th Street to the south, Lavergne Avenue to the west, and the Stevenson Expressway to the north, was previously home to the LeClaire Courts public housing community, which was completed in the 1950s and demolished in 2011. Under Habitat’s multi-phase plan, the site will be redeveloped into as many as 700 residential units, most of which will be affordable; nearly 440,000 square feet of commercial space; and publicly accessible open areas. “The LeClaire Courts redevelopment has transformative potential, and this loan approval solidifies a critical piece of the capital stack, enabling other agencies, lenders and investors to move forward knowing the CHA is fully committed to this project,” said Habitat President Matt Fiascone. “Together, we have a shared vision of transforming this vital artery of the city into a community that local residents are excited to once again call home, catalyzing future investment through an influx of high-quality jobs, much-needed housing, essential health care and child care services, and diverse retail and recreational offerings.” Designed by SCB, the first phase of the redevelopment consists of two six-story mixed-use buildings located on the west side of Cicero Avenue between 44th and 45th streets. Collectively, they will offer 183 apartments in a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans, as well as a 14,000-square-foot early childhood center and 2,200 square feet of additional first floor retail space across the two structures. Ninety percent of the homes will be designated as affordable through income and rent restrictions accompanying the development’s various sources of public financial support, including the CHA, the Chicago Department of Housing and the Illinois Housing Development Authority, with the remainder available as market-rate apartments. Residents in Phase I will have access to on-site amenities including a fitness center in each building, multiple lounges, community rooms, resident services meeting space, laundry facilities, package rooms and bicycle storage. A rooftop apiary on the north building will enhance urban biodiversity, foster environmental sustainability, provide fresh honey for residents and offer educational opportunities for families. Additional exterior features will include community-centered murals on both the north and south buildings, surface parking, two playgrounds, a landscaped gathering area between the structures with a greenway running through it, and accessible walking paths that will eventually connect to an on-site grocer, healthcare facilities and other retail offerings. Several procedural steps remain prior to LeClaire Courts’ groundbreaking, planned for spring 2025, including final financing approval by the Illinois Housing Development Authority’s Board of Directors, anticipated for this November. Also recently authorized was $5.5 million in TIF funding by the city’s TIF Investment Committee to support the redevelopment. Next steps on final TIF approval and other financing include a full City Council vote, expected later this year. Infrastructure improvements to roadways and utilities have commenced in recent months to prepare the location for redevelopment. Enhancements include street realignment to the city grid; new curbs, gutters, sidewalks and driveways; installation of ADA-accessible ramps; resurfacing of existing streets; sewer upgrades and replacements; water main capacity expansion; new lighting systems; traffic signal modernization and new signalized intersections; and the integration of new utility lines. Construction of the LeClaire Courts residential phase is being led by The George Sollitt Construction Company. ",Garfield Ridge
CDC approves $5.5 million in TIF for LeClaire Courts,"The Community Development Commission has approved $5.5 million in TIF funding for the first residential phase of LeClaire Courts. Planned by The Habitat Company and Cabrera Capital Partners in collaboration with the CHA, the overall LeClaire Courts master plan allows for a maximum of 725 dwelling units, multiple mixed-use buildings, approximately 440,000 square feet of commercial space, publicly accessible open space, and parking all built across multiple phases. The overall site is bound by S. Cicero Ave to the east, W. 45th St to the south, S. Lavergne Ave to the west, and the Stevenson Expressway to the north. The first residential phase is a smaller portion of the overall site, bound by S. Cicero Ave to the east, S. La Crosse Ave to the west, W. 44th St to the north, and W. 45th St to the south. With a total of 160 residential units, this phase will have two six-story mixed-use buildings located at 4400 S. Cicero and 4458 S. Cicero. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the massing of buildings have been broken down into multiple intersecting volumes, with the materiality of the brick color palette selected to further break down the massing. A similar massing strategy and material palette will be used on both buildings to unify them while using different window articulations to give each of them their own identity. Both will have space on the exterior for community art. A public courtyard will separate the two buildings along S. Cicero Ave as the beginning of a green belt through the entire master plan. The buildings will share 123 parking spaces in surface lots to the west. Designed as an L-shaped building, the north building at 4400 S. Cicero will have 110 residential units. The ground floor will feature 14,000 square feet of retail space for Chicago Commons Early Childhood Center along the entire S. Cicero Ave frontage, with the residential lobby facing W. 44th St. A fitness center, flex space, admin space, mail room, laundry room, and bike room for 37 bikes will round out the ground floor on the west wing of the floor plate. Planned as a bar-shaped building, the south building at 4458 S. Cicero will rise 70 feet tall just like the northern building. On the inside, the slightly smaller building will have 50 residential units. The ground floor will have 2,500 square feet of corner retail at the intersection of S. Cicero Ave and W. 45th St, with the residential lobby fronting S. Cicero Ave in the middle of the building’s street frontage. The north end of the ground floor will have fitness space, flex space, and residential amenity space as well as a laundry room and bike room for 30 bikes.  As a CHA-led development, more than 50% of the residential units will exceed ARO requirements and CHA units will be affordable to residents earning between 0-80% AMI. Between both buildings there will be 1 unit at 30% AMI, 33 units at 40%, 76 at 60% AMI, 34 units at 80% AMI and 16 market-rate units.  The approximately $97 million project will be funded with a variety of sources, including $6.3 million from a first mortgage, $5.5 million in TIF funding, $9.3 million in multi-family loan funds, a $10.9 million IHDA soft loan, $3.2 million in seller financing, $1.1 million in accrued construction interest, a $1 million Illinois DCEO grant, $30.25 million in LIHTC equity, a $1.4 million CHA Soft loan, $1.3 million in deferred developer fees, and a $27 million CHA capital loan. Both buildings are set to begin construction in late Spring 2025. With George Sollitt Construction Company serving as the general contractor, construction is expected to take approximately 14-15 months. ",Garfield Ridge
CHA presents updated design for LeClaire Courts Site A,"The Chicago Housing Authority in partnership with The Habitat Company recently presented the updated design for LeClaire Courts Site A to the Chicago Plan Commission. With the Planned development originally approved back in 2021, this courtesy presentation is part of the mandatory review process for the site plan approval of this first residential phase. As approved, the overall LeClaire Courts master plan allows for a maximum of 725 dwelling units, multiple mixed-use buildings, approximately 440,000 square feet of commercial space, publicly accessible open space, and parking all built across multiple phases. The overall site is bound by S. Cicero Ave to the east, W. 45th St to the south, S. Lavergne Ave to the west, and the Stevenson Expressway to the north.

The buildings will also include a small portion of market-rate apartments. While no new buildings have broken ground on the overall site yet, CHA and The Habitat Company have been making steps towards getting the properties ready for new construction. 2023 saw the completion of water main work on the site and the finalizing of the infrastructure agreement with the city. Further infrastructure work is expected to commence in Q1 2024. When the development was approved by the Plan Commission in 2021, the first phase of the overall master plan was also approved, which included a grocery store building and a medical office building. This commercial phase is set to break ground in Q2 2024 after the infrastructure work is in place and final financing has been secured. For the residential buildings at 4400 S. Cicero and 4458 S. Cicero, The Habitat Company and CHA are working together with IHDA and the City of Chicago to put together an agreement on the financing. The team expects to spend 2024 working on the financing package and moving forward with the next phase of the architectural drawings to get pricing and finalize the design. They expect an early 2025 closing on the financing with groundbreaking following that. Construction would take approximately 14-15 months. ",Garfield Ridge
700 units of mixed-income housing planned for vacant LeClaire Courts site,"The Chicago Housing Authority and private developers are moving forward with a plan to reimage the vacant 32-acre former site of the LeClaire Courts housing complex in the Garfield Ridge neighborhood. If realized, the $350 million mixed-use plan could be one of the largest real estate projects to come to the Southwest Side in recent history.  Located along Cicero Avenue south of the Stevenson Expressway and a mile-and-a-half north of Midway Airport, the LeClaire Courts site has sat idle since the CHA demolished the original 1950s-era housing complex in 2011. Redeveloping the parcel—and providing a required minimum of 186 homes for displaced CHA residents—has been a long and slow-moving process for the Chicago Housing Authority. The city agency started its search for developers in 2016 and in 2019 formed LeClaire Partners: a joint venture between itself and developers Cabrera Capital Markets, and The Habitat Company. At a virtual community meeting in December, the team finally shared its site plan, designed by Knight Engineers & Architects and Solomon Cordwell Buenz. The multiphase proposal calls for roughly 700 mixed-income residences comprising CHA, affordable, and market-rate units. The development will also provide new retail, offices, open space, parking lots, and facilities offering services like daycare and job training. According to the team, the first phase will include two 80-foot-tall mid-rise buildings with a combined 250 residences as well as a new grocery store at the corner of 44th Street and Cicero Avenue. Future phases will encompass about a dozen low-rise residential buildings situated west of phase one. In addition to holding community meetings to discuss the plan, the development team also filed a zoning application with the city late last month—a clear indication that they're serious about moving forward. The proposal will still need to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the Chicago City Council for a final vote. The developers hope to get approvals and financing in the third quarter of this year and break ground by late 2021 or early 2022. Construction of the first phase is expected to take 18 months, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. ",Garfield Ridge
Lawson House celebrates ribbon cutting,"Mayor Brandon Johnson recently joined city officials, developer Holsten Real Estate Development Corporation, and others to celebrate the grand opening of the renovation of Lawson House, a 406-unit affordable apartment complex in the Gold Coast. Designed by Farr Associates, the $128 million renovation project set out to modernize and preserve affordable apartment units. The rehabilitation of the historic 200,000-square-foot, 24-story apartment complex transformed the building’s 583 single-room occupancy units (SROs) into 409 affordable apartment units with private kitchens and bathrooms.   The ground floor renovation now includes retail space, apartment amenities, and social services for Lawson House tenants. A new rooftop terrace will provide additional space for social services programming for residents. Lawson House dates back to 1931 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its cultural and architectural legacy. Developed by a partnership between Holsten Real Estate Development Corporation and Holsten Human Capital Development, this building is committed to preserving affordable units for households at or below 15% and 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI) levels for a minimum of 50 years. Of the 409 residential units, 322 will be rented out using subsidies: 122 apartments will be allocated for Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund rental subsidies, 100 will be rented through Chicago Housing Authority Project-Based Vouchers (PBVs), and 100 will be rented through Project-Based Rental Assistance. The redevelopment of Lawson House received support from the Chicago Housing Authority, the City’s Department of Housing (DOH), and the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) which provided up to $5 million in 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and $17.5 million in HOME funds to finance the preservation and rehabilitation of this historic Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) building.

OMA/AMO rethinks Stone Island retail identity,"OMA / AMO has partnered with Stone Island to develop a new identity for the Italian brand’s stores. Positioned as spaces to share its wealth of experiences with its communities, Stone Island has defined the new stores through its research and experimentation on design and product manipulation.  The new store concept features altar-like spaces highlighting Stone Island’s devotion to technology and development, shared by its followers. Niches for archival pieces and prototypes – results of years of experimentation in Stone Island’s lab in their Ravarino headquarters – showcase past thinking and future ambitions about product design. Beyond shop opening hours, the space will host public presentations, salons, workshops, and private events. The stores form a base for current and new customers, complementing the brand’s online presence. Stone Island’s approach in transforming materials from typical into unique inspires and informs the new stores’ architecture. The stone-like palette of the spaces is formed with specially treated off-the-shelf materials – without actual concrete or stone. Shredded paper and resins are compressed under high pressure to become durable “concrete panels”. Cork – the central material to the Stone Island stores – is burnt, sandblasted and coated, turning dark and textured, while maintaining its sound-absorbing, humidity-controlling features. Corrugated steel panels, sand-coated, acquire a soft surface. A large digital chandelier, suspended from the ceiling, broadcasts Stone Island’s culture to its community. Stone Island Creative Director and President Carlo Rivett stated that, “Stone Island and AMO share values of innovation, functionality, and passion. I am very happy to begin this important partnership, a new visual approach for our stores, to speak to our communities.” AMO Director Samir Bantal added that, “Research and innovation are at the core of Stone Island. The space, materiality, and program of the stores underpin the brand’s ethos, and reinforce a sense of belonging of its community of like-minded people.” The new concept debuted within a new, 1,900 square foot retail space for Stone Island in Chicago which opened on Thursday, October 20, 2022, ahead of the future opening of locations in Seoul, Munich and Stockholm. Located at 48 E. Oak St, the location is the brand’s first in the city. ",Gold Coast

Committee on Design reviews 12 W. Maple,"The Committee on Design has reviewed a proposal for a residential tower at 12 W. Maple. Planned by Fern Hill Company and Calmwater Capital, the project will be located just west of Mariano Park and the intersection of W. Maple St and N. State St. The tight site is currently occupied by a four-story masonry building and small one-story structure. With Lamar Johnson Collaborative as the architect, the new development will consist of a 34-story residential tower. Planned to rise 449 feet, the building will deliver 54 luxury condominium residences. Tenants will have access to 81 parking spaces accessed by two vertical car lifts managed by a dedicated valet. Amenities will be located at the 7th and 18th floors of the tower. Drawing from the context of the Gold Coast and the shores of Lake Michigan, the tower’s massing has been carved in strategic locations based on unit layouts and orientation of views to the east. The exterior terraces are anchored by landscape, providing native grasses on every terrace and trees at the 7th floor outdoor terrace. At the ground floor, special attention was paid to the pedestrian experience with high quality natural limestone and metal paneling brought down to the ground along the W. Maple St facade. The residential entry will be along the western end of the street frontage, with a curb cut placed to allow for cars to enter an internal motor court, bringing pick-up, drop-off, deliveries, and valet queuing off of the street. The discussion opened with John Ronan questioning the blank western wall created by placing the core along the western property line of the building. Ronan suggested that this blank wall seems unnecessary, and the corridor and elevators could be flipped to allow for a light-filled corridor facing west. Later in the discussion, Sara Beardsley suggested bringing some kind of activation or massing articulation to the west elevation so that the building wouldn’t seemingly turn its back on its neighbors to the west Brian Lee reiterated the idea of the building’s relation to its neighbors later saying the current design is thumbing its nose to the neighbors to the west and reconfiguring the core would be very helpful. John Ronan chimed in and asked if the core could be oriented east to west which could help achieve units with three-direction exposures. The design team responded that they can’t use any exposure facing west for light and ventilation requirements due to being up against the property line but reconfiguring the core could work well to improve the western elevation.  The next point came from Reed Kroloff who asked why there are so many car parking spaces in the project and whether the curb cut is really needed along W. Maple St. The design team responded that the parking ratio is in response to market demands and that the height of the parking podium allows for the amenity deck to sit just above the adjacent building to the east. In regard to the curb cut, the alley at the back of the site is narrow and is littered with dumpsters and interrupted by electrical poles, so two-way traffic through the alley would be very difficult. While introducing a curb cut was not the first choice, it would allow for vehicles to come off the street and reduce traffic.  Committee member Hana Ishikawa expressed concern for the landscaping planned for the building, discussing how it will be hard to have plantings underneath overhangs be viable in the long-term. Ishikawa also questioned how plantings within private homes could be maintained in the original design intent.  The design team from LJC responded that they have consulted with their in-house landscape architects and are considering the balance between protecting the grasses from the wind and ensuring their viability under the overhangs. With regard to upkeep, the developers plan to implement a program through the eventual HOA that will manage maintenance for the greenery and plantings within the building. The final comment came from Reed Kroloff who identified that the current design calls for natural limestone at the base and cost-effective precast concrete for the upper portion of the tower used to mimic limestone. Kroloff pointed out that those two materials will age and color differently resulting in a two-tone facade over time. Kroloff encouraged the design and development team to bring integrity to the facade by either bringing the limestone all the way up or taking the precast concrete panels down to the base. After this meeting, the project will continue going through the city review process, with these comments integrated into those future discussions. As the project looks to rezone the site, it will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. The developers are looking to secure approvals before looking at a timeline for leasing and construction.  ",Gold Coast
Lawson House renovation scores $74M permit,"As construction wraps up on downtown's massive One Chicago project, work is ready to begin across the street on an ambitious makeover of the former Lawson House YMCA. On Wednesday, Holsten Real Estate Development received a $74.2 million renovation permit to convert the 24-story historic tower at 30 W. Chicago Avenue from 538 single-room occupancy (SRO) units into 409 affordable apartments. Built in 1931, the Lawson House was designed by architects Perkins, Chatten & Hammond in the Art Deco style and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Holsten acquired the property in 2014 under an agreement that it must remain affordable housing for at least 50 years. The renovated units will meet modern standards and include private kitchens and bathrooms as well as air conditioning. The building's entrance will be moved from Chicago Avenue to Dearborn Street, and its old-school gymnasium turned into a modern fitness center. The long-discussed plan also calls for on-site social services and ground-floor retail space. Last month the city of Chicago approved a multifamily loan of up to $17.59 million for the renovation, the Sun-Times reported. Other financing sources include a $79.38 million bridge loan from Chase Bank, a $17.2 million loan from the Illinois Housing Development Authority, $12.4 million in historic preservation tax credits, and affordable housing tax credits. The total project cost is an estimated $122 million. Construction on the Lawson House is expected to last two-and-a-half years. The building's previous tenants will be relocated to suitable housing and given priority when the building reopens in 2024. The permit lists Farr Associates as the project architect and Walsh Construction as the general contractor.  ",Gold Coast
345-foot-tall Gold Coast rental tower advances,"After winning the approval of the Chicago Plan Commission in August, a 345-foot-tall apartment tower slated for Chicago's Gold Coast has cleared another important hurdle. On Wednesday, the city's Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards voted in favor of the 304-unit project, which will replace the former Barnes & Noble bookstore at the southwest corner of State and Elm. Developed by Quick's LLC, an affiliate of Chicago-based Newcastle Limited, the 30-story proposal has been under discussion for more than two years. The developer initially pitched a 39-story tower with 368 apartments but was shot down by Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd). Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the revised development features a glassy facade with several setbacks that align with the heights of nearby buildings.  The tower also includes commercial retail space and a 132-car parking garage. A second subarea within the site's boundaries would redevelop the next-door Lou Malnati's pizzeria property with a new two-story commercial building. The structure would be set back from State street and line up with the adjacent Viceroy Hotel to create an oversized sidewalk for outdoor dining. Lou Malnati's currently has a long-term lease at 1120 N. State, so it's unclear when phase two would begin.  Although the site's underlying zoning of DX-7 Downtown Mixed-Use District remains unchanged under the plan, Ald. Hopkins and other city officials had to review and approve the project's Residential-Business Planned Development. The full City Council still needs to sign off on the measure, which could happen as soon as next week.  The developer is required to provide 10 percent affordable housing units and will fulfill its obligation by building eight of the required 30 apartments on-site and make a $4.1 million cash payment into the city's affordable housing fund. New citywide rules requiring 20 percent affordability take effect in October, so the State Street project could be one of the last big high-rises to squeak in under the old regulations.   Newcastle hopes to begin demolition of the former bookstore building in spring 2022. Construction on the new apartment tower is expected to start no earlier than fall 2022 and wrap up in the first half of 2024.    ",Gold Coast
12-story rental complex reaches final height in Gold Coast,"The 12-story mixed-use development known as Gild has reached its final height at the northwest corner of State Parkway and Division Street in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood.  Developed by Newcastle Limited and designed by architecture firm CallisonRTKL, the upcoming mid-rise structure replaced a cluster of low-rise commercial buildings.

""Despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, everything is on schedule thanks to the hard work of everyone involved. We look forward to opening in spring 2022."" Meanwhile, Newcastle is pitching a 29-story high-rise with 304 apartments at the former Barnes & Noble location at nearby 1130 N. State Street. The project is listed on the July agenda of the Chicago Plan Commission, though Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) has yet to put his support behind the zoning change the project will require. ",Gold Coast
Proposed Gold Coast rental tower returns with changes,"After more than two years of discussions and design revisions, developer Newcastle Limited shared its latest plans to redevelop the former Gold Coast Barnes & Noble bookstore at 1130 N. State Street into a 29-story high-rise with 304 rental units. The 345-foot-tall proposal boasts a series of refinements since the last community presentation, hosted by Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) last fall. ""The plans that we shared in October were the result of more than 100 meetings with residents, neighborhood organizations, and owners associations, and led to meaningful changes that I believe made this a far better project,"" said Newcastle's Mike Haney at a recent community meeting. ""We submitted the plans to Chicago Department of Planning and Development and their feedback further improved the project, especially the pedestrian experience and how the building relates to its surroundings,"" Haney said. Revisions include wider sidewalks and reduced second-floor retail space as well as a substantial reworking of the glassy tower's crown and massing.   ""Previously we had a very gentle step at the top,"" said Chris Pemberton, an architect with Solomon Cordwell Buenz. ""Planning asked us to study a one-thirds and two-thirds relationship where the lower step relates to the height of the Viceroy [Hotel] and the upper steps relate to 1135 N. Dearborn and 4 E. Elm."" The plan includes 105 parking spaces, eight on-site affordable-rate apartments, and will make an $8.1 million contribution to the city's affordable housing and neighborhood opportunity funds. The project also takes into account the eventual redevelopment of the one-story Lou Malnati's pizzeria next door. Envisioned as a later phase, the new Lou's will be set back from the street to provide a large sidewalk dining area, similar to the adjacent Viceroy. In 2019, Newcastle originally pitched a 39-story proposal with 368 apartments for the Barnes & Noble site, but that plan was shot down by Ald. Brian Hopkins. The elected official called the previous design unattractive and ""excessively tall for that lot,"" telling the Chicago Tribune that the development team ""missed the mark on all counts."" Hopkins says he's still collecting neighborhood feedback on the current design.  ""No decision has been made yet whether [this proposal] will get my support, but we are giving it its due process, which it's certainly entitled to have,"" the elected officials said Wednesday. ""I think the development team has worked in good faith with both my office and the community over the number of years that this proposal has been in the conversation."" Wednesday's online community meeting hit the maximum number of attendees and some Gold Coast residents were unable to tune in. Ald. Hopkins says he will host a repeat presentation on Monday, June 28th at 6:00 p.m. The public can register for that Zoom meeting here.  The high-rise proposal at 1130 N. State is not seeking a change to the downtown site's underlying zoning but it will need to go through the city's Planned Development process, which requires the approval of the alderman, the Plan Commission, and the City Council. If approvals go as planned, Newcastle expects demolition of the bookstore to take place in spring 2022. Construction is anticipated to begin in fall 2022 and wrap up in early 2024.   ",Gold Coast
29-story rental tower slated for State Street Barnes & Noble moves forward,"UPDATE: Ald. Brian Hopkins says he will host an online community meeting to discuss the latest revisions to the 1130 N. State Street proposal on Wednesday, June 23 at 6:00 p.m. Click here to register for the virtual event. A long-discussed plan to demolish the former Barnes & Noble bookstore at 1130 N. State Street and redevelop the Gold Coast site into a mixed-use high-rise is inching closer to reality. Developer Newcastle Limited recently filed a zoning application for a 29-story tower—an indication the proposal is advancing. Newcastle originally pitched a 39-story tower with 368 apartments, but that plan was shot down by Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) in 2019. The elected official called the previous design unattractive and ""excessively tall for that lot,"" telling the Chicago Tribune that the development team ""missed the mark on all counts."" The latest plan was presented to Gold Coast neighbors in October. The Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed building shrunk from 465 to 326 feet tall and will feature 304 luxury rental units, 31,000 square feet of retail space, and parking for 132 cars. There will be eight affordable units on-site and the developer will pay $8.1 million into the city's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund and Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. The development boundaries include the Lou Malnati's pizzeria to the immediate south, but the restaurant will remain in place for the time being. A later phase would demolish the low-rise restaurant and erect a new structure for Lou Malnati's which will be set further back from the street to create a larger sidewalk and additional outdoor dining space.  The high-rise proposal at 1130 N. State is not seeking a change to the site's underlying zoning but it will need to go through the city's Planned Development process, which requires the approval of the alderman, the Plan Commission, and the City Council. It's unclear if the current plan has the support of Ald. Hopkins, and the alderman's office did not respond to a request for comment. If and when the project is approved by the city, Newcastle plans to demolish the former bookstore within 12 months. Construction on the new tower would take approximately 24 months, according to the developer.  Newcastle is also the developer behind the upcoming 12-story Gild apartments at nearby 1210 N. State Parkway. Currently under construction, the 89-unit rental building is expected to welcome residents in early 2022. ",Gold Coast
'Gild' apartments go vertical in Gold Coast,"After breaking ground late last year, the 12-story apartment development known as Gild is rising above street level at the northwest corner of State and Division in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood.  Developed by Newcastle Limited, Gild replaces a cluster of demolished low-rise commercial buildings that once contained businesses such as McFadden’s, Tip Top Inn, and Hash House a Go Go. The upcoming development will bring 18,000 square feet of new retail space to the corner and top it with 89 high-end rental units. Gild's apartments will be offered in studio, one-, and two-bedroom layouts, and the majority of units will feature private balconies. The plan also includes an outdoor deck for tenants, a green roof, and 33 off-street parking spaces, according to the project's building permit. Gild is expected to welcome renters in early 2022. Chicago-based architecture firm CallisonRTKL designed Gild to fit in more than stand out. The conservative-looking building is clad in warm brick and panels that will ""represent but not imitate"" its older neighbors to the north, architect Keith Campbell told Curbed in 2019. Meanwhile, Newcastle is eyeing an even larger rental development for the former Barnes & Noble bookstore site located at nearby 1130 N. State Street. Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) rejected the developer's initial plans for a 39-story apartment tower at the site in 2019, but a redesigned and scaled-back 29-story proposal is currently under review.  ",Gold Coast
Mars opens Global Research and Development Hub on Goose Island,"Mars has announced the opening of its Global Research and Development Hub on its Goose Island campus. One of seven Mars global innovation sites around the world, the 44,000-square-foot, $42 million facility will be dedicated to chocolate and nut testing, research and innovation.

Onni Group lands financing for Halsted Pointe Phase 1,"Developer Onni Group has secured $50 million in construction financing for the 46-story mixed-use first phase of Halsted Pointe. Initially approved back in late summer 2021, the overall development will replace the current Greyhound Bus facility at 901 N. Halsted on the southern tip of Goose Island. After demolition permits were issued in May, the site has been cleared in preparation for the new development. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the 46-story mixed-use tower has been designed with rectilinear corners instead of the original rounded corners, the building massing will feature an angular expression enhanced with depth and plane changes as the tower rises. The facade will feature angled mullions and balcony walls in a captured glass system that uses two glazing and mullion colors.  At the base, the sloped site creates a series of lower floors meeting different elevations around the building. The lowest level will be fully submerged and house retail parking and mechanical spaces. The next level up will front N. Halsted St with 13,300 square feet of retail. Above that, the official first floor will have leasing offices facing north, the residential lobby facing east, and 5,600 square feet of retail facing south.  The building’s podium will span from the 2nd through 5th floors, holding 8 units per floor in the northern section under the tower, and parking spaces in the remaining floor plate to the south. The podium will have a total of 200 parking spaces. A full indoor amenity suite including a spa/wellness space, fitness center, game room, and party room and lounge will occupy the sixth floor, opening up to an outdoor amenity deck that will include a pool.  With a total of 460 apartments, the typical residential floors will have 12 units per level made up of a mix of one-beds, one-bed flexes, two-beds, and three-beds, representing a shift to larger units with more bedrooms per floor. Every unit will feature a balcony. Overall, Onni Group is planning four phases of development for the site that is expected to deliver up to 2,650 residential units, retail space, a hotel, and 1,470 parking spaces. Subsequent phases haven’t been fully designed but preliminary approvals suggest a potential for four more towers rising up to almost 700 feet tall. With permits in the works and financing secured from Otera Capital, construction on Phase 1 is imminent and groundbreaking is set for some time this year. Once work begins, construction is expected to take 24 months to reach completion. ",Goose Island

Onni receives approval for revised Phase 1 at Halsted Pointe ,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development recently granted Onni Group site plan approval and a minor change request for the first phase of Halsted Pointe.  Initially approved back in late summer 2021, the development will replace the current Greyhound Bus facility at 901 N. Halsted on the southern tip of Goose Island. After demolition permits were issued in May, the site has been cleared in preparation for the new development. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the original plan for the first phase called for a 46-story tower rising 504 feet. The revised scheme will include a minor haircut from the planned 504 feet down to 497 feet. The 460 residential units and 200 parking spaces will remain while the 20,000 square feet of retail has been solidified at a slightly lower 18,900 square feet.  While the tower’s massing will stay more or less the same, the new design replaces the rounded corners of the building with rectilinear corners. The new building massing will feature an angular expression enhanced with depth and plane changes as the tower rises. The new facade will feature angled mullions and balcony walls in a captured glass system that uses two glazing and mullion colors. At the top of the tower, the crown has been reconfigured and the rooftop mechanical screen will use the materials and expression found on the podium, which has also been revised to use more straight corners and an angled expression. At the base, the sloped site creates a series of lower floors meeting different elevations around the building. The lowest level will be fully submerged and house retail parking and mechanical spaces. The next level up will front N. Halsted St with 13,300 square feet of retail. Above that, the official first floor will have leasing offices facing north, the residential lobby facing east, and 5,600 square feet of retail facing south.  The podium will span from the 2nd through 5th floors, holding 8 units per floor in the northern section under the tower, and parking spaces in the remaining floor plate to the south. A full indoor amenity suite including a spa/wellness space, fitness center, game room, and party room and lounge will occupy the sixth floor, opening up to an outdoor amenity deck that will include a pool.  Within the tower, the typical residential floors will have 12 units per level made up of a mix of one-beds, one-bed flexes, two-beds, and three-beds, representing a shift to larger units with more bedrooms per floor. Every unit will feature a balcony. Overall, for the site, Onni Group is planning four phases of development that is expected to deliver up to 2,650 residential units, retail space, a hotel, and 1,470 parking spaces.

City Council approves Mars Wrigley expansion,"City Council has approved plans by Mars Wrigley for a new pilot plant on their Goose Island campus. Located at the northern tip of Goose Island, the Mars Wrigley campus is bound by W. Blackhawk st to the south and N. Cherry Ave to the east. The Morton Salt redevelopment is located almost directly across the river to the west. With a design by CRB Group, the new facility will be a one-story building spanning 45,000 square feet. Placed directly south of the current pilot plant, the 30-foot-tall building has been designed to match the existing buildings on campus, using precast concrete and metal panels in a similar color to the existing plant.  The program of the building is intended to test and assemble new products, augmenting the services already performed in the existing plant. Some of the spaces include receiving, ingredient processing, a test kitchen, tech development, barline, and storage. Employees will enter at the western side of the building in an outcropping that will hold locker rooms as well as a break room space. This portion of the building will be clad in glass curtain wall to allow for increased light exposure for employees. Since the new building will replace existing surface parking, Mars Wrigley has acquired the parking lot to the east of N. Cherry Ave and this approval will incorporate it into the campus. Defunct railroad tracks along the parking lot will be replaced with a dedicated bike and pedestrian path. The development will include new trees planted around the campus and new bike parking. The building is expected to meet LEED Silver and reduce indoor water use by 40%. Construction on the $40 million project is expected to begin in June 2022 and complete one year later in June 2023.

City commissioners OK five-tower Goose Island megadevelopment,"A $1.3 billion project to redevelop an 8-acre site at the southern tip of Goose Island into five high-rises is one step closer to becoming a reality after the Chicago Plan Commission voted in favor of the massive riverfront proposal. Dubbed ""Halsted Pointe,"" the four-phase development from Vancouver-based Onni Group and Chicago's Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture will be built over 8 to 10 years at the former Greyhound bus maintenance facility at 901 N. Halsted Street. When complete, it will deliver 2,650 rental apartments (20 percent will be affordable), 300 hotel rooms, 1,400 parking spaces, 3.8 acres of publicly accessible open space, and a new pedestrian bridge connecting to the riverwalk promenade at 600 W. Chicago.  

 The first phase tower will rise 504 feet at the northwest corner of the site and will contain 485 apartments, 200 parking spaces, and a grocery store. The Plan Commission presentation showed the later phases of the project as ""placeholder"" designs that would be further refined at a later date to give each building a different identity. The third phase tower will top out at an impressive 691 feet, according to massing diagrams. Halsted Pointe will require a zoning change from DS-5 (Downtown Service District) to DX-5 (Downtown Mixed-Use District) and then to a Waterway-Residential-Business Planned Development. The change will need to go before the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council for final approval. Future phases will still go before the Plan Commission for a courtesy presentation, and the commissioners will have an opportunity to provide feedback.

Goose Island megaproject gets height bump,"Onni Group's five-tower ""Halsted Pointe"" megadevelopment on Goose Island is headed to the Chicago Plan Commission this week with some noteworthy changes. In addition to now spelling Pointe with an ""e"" at the end, the massive multiphase proposal has grown in height from 584 to 691 feet.  The increase mainly affects the development's third phase tower located at the site's southern tip, where the north branch of the Chicago River and the North Branch Canal split. While earlier plans for the residential high-rise called for roughly 640 rental units, that tower is now shown containing 1,015 apartments.  Despite these changes, the development's total number of dwelling units remains unchanged at 2,650. The second phase, located just north of the taller third phase tower, received a reduction in both height and density. The overall amount of parking has come down slightly from 1,470 to 1,400 spaces. One notable absence from the revised plans is an updated rendering of the redesigned towers from project designer Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture. The Plan Commission presentation posted by the city's Department of Planning and Development includes several slides that simply read ""rendering in progress."" Hopefully those images will be ready in time for the upcoming Plan Commission vote, which is scheduled for Thursday, August 19, at 10 a.m. If the project's zoning is approved by the Plan Commission and City Council, Onni aims to break ground on Halsted Pointe's first phase—a 46-story, 485-unit residential tower at the site's northwest corner—sometime next year.  Construction on phase one is expected to take 24 to 30 months, a representative from the developer said in April. Five towers will eventually occupy the 8-acre site at 901 N. Halsted Street, which was previously home to a Greyhound bus maintenance facility. The Halsted Pointe masterplan also includes up to 300 hotel rooms, a grocery store, an outdoor market and ""social lawn,"" and a new pedestrian bridge connecting to the riverfront promenade at 600 W. Chicago.    ",Goose Island
Halsted Point: A five-tower plan for the tip of Goose Island,"Vancouver-based developer Onni Group has revealed its plans for ""Halsted Point,"" a four-phase project that would bring five high-rise towers ranging from 28 to 56 stories to the southern edge of Goose Island. The massive mixed-use proposal calls for 2.7 million square feet of development an 8-acre site previously home to the Greyhound bus maintenance facility at 901 N. Halsted Street. The completed project will deliver 2,650 rental apartments (20 percent on-site affordable), 108,000 square feet of office space, 54,000 square feet of retail, 1340 linear feet of public riverwalk, and 3.8 acres of open space. ""Given this scale of this community and certain economic realities, this will be a multiphase project,"" said Onni vice president of development Brian Brodeur at a virtual community meeting on Thursday. ""We are anticipating this to be a four-phase project beginning early next year. The timing of subsequent phases will be based on market demand, but we feel this will be a 10-plus-year overall build-out."" Onni still needs zoning approval for Halsted Point, but it aims to break ground on the first phase—a 46-story residential tower and grocery store at the site's northwest corner—in 2022. Construction on phase one is expected to take 24 to 30 months. Later phases will be added in a clockwise pattern and call for three more residential towers (the tallest rising 584 feet) and a commercial high-rise with offices and hotel rooms.  The commercial tower will be located on the southwest corner to act as a ""buffer"" between the new residential towers and the site's industrial neighbors. ""We believe residential is going be much quicker to come back post-pandemic than commercial,"" said Brodeur. ""That's the reason we've phased our site the way we have, with our commercial building last."" The five-tower is designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the Chicago-based firm that also designed Onni's multiphase Old Town Park development at Division and Wells. Architect Aracely Nevarez described the glassy towers at Halsted Point as a ""modern and sculpted"" response to the city skyline, while the brick-clad lower levels tie into the industrial buildings found in the area. The project's buildings are aligned in a way that keeps the tip of the island, arguably the site's best real estate, open. ""We had an opportunity to place a tower right at the corner and take full advantage of the city skyline views,"" explained Nevarez. ""But the more we studied this, it made more sense to leave that area open and create a social lawn that can be enjoyed by all."" The so-called ""social lawn"" is joined by other open space improvements including a new riverwalk and bike trails around the site's parameter and a ""market plaza"" that will act as the development's town square. Halsted Point is also designed to connect to the nearby Wild Mile—an ongoing initiative to naturalize the North Branch Canal into an eco-park and boardwalk. There are plans to construct a new pedestrian bridge connecting Halsted Point to the riverfront promenade at 600 W. Chicago. That portion of the plan will need the cooperation of the Army Corps of Engineers to become a reality, the development team said. The completed project will contain 1,470 parking spaces. The majority of the stalls as well as all of the site's loading and trash removal will be located below grade. The plan does feature some above-grade parking, but the spaces will be concealed behind active uses such as rental townhouses included in the second and third phases. The developers will work with CDOT to widen Halsted Street, eliminate on-street parking, upgrade signals, and make turn lane and bike lane improvements near the site. There are currently no plans to widen either of the Halsted Street bridges, but the development is situated along the future route of a potential transitway identified in the city's North Branch Framework Plan. The Halsted Point project will use no controversial TIF money. The developers will contribute more than $28 million to the city, including Industrial Corridor System Fees and payments into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. According to Onni, the development is expected to create just shy of 10,000 construction jobs and generate $716 million in taxes over the next 20 years. Onni closed a deal to purchase the Greyhound site for $38 million in early 2019. ""When I was kid, growing up right over the bridge from, here we used to call this area ghost town,"" said Ald. Walter Burnett (27th) at Thursday's meeting. ""Now this area is very vibrant. We're allowing for some residential [development], some new infrastructure is getting built, and the riverwalk is getting enhanced. A lot of great things are happening.""   ",Goose Island
Developer pursuing timber office building on Goose Island,"Hines Interests is ready to move forward with a long-discussed plan to construct a six-story mass timber office building on Goose Island. The developer revealed 'T3' (which for stands timber, technology, and transit) back in 2017, but recently brought on Stream Realty Partners to actively market the North Branch project to potential tenants. ""We're feeling energized coming out of the pandemic,"" Hines managing director Brian Atkinson told Urbanize. ""And we think there's an opportunity in timber.""  Chicago has a firey history when it comes to wooden structures, but modern mass timber meets or exceeds the stringent fire rating standards set by the City of Chicago. On top of being more sustainable than concrete and steel alternatives, timber construction may play a vital role in attracting tenants. ""We've seen the benefits of biophilic design: what it does for people's moods as well the antimicrobial properties of timber,"" explained Atkinson. Additionally, the loft-style layout offers a chance for greater light and air, outdoor tenant spaces on every level, and the same indoor air quality found in brand new trophy towers. ""We're believers in this product typology,"" said Atkinson. ""Older industrial warehouses offer a great aesthetic and vibe, and this would be a new construction version."" Designed by architecture firm DLR Group, the 270,000-square-foot T3 Chicago project is slated for 1017 W. Division Street—ironically, the former site of Big Bay Lumber Yard. Atkinson believes that the project's location outside of Chicago's Central Business District could also be a selling point for tenants looking to avoid the density of downtown.  As Hines continues to work on the 1.2 million-square-foot Salesforce Tower, Atkinson says he is aware of the difficulties facing the larger office market but he has reasons to be optimistic looking forward.  ""Obviously there are real challenges,"" said Atkinson. ""We do not have robust occupancy downtown. But we're seeing green shoots, too. Employees want to come back to work. People have been trying to work from home, but are missing out on opportunities for socialization, mentorship, and career development. You can't do those things without in-person interaction."" Atkinson said the lull in the market is due to lease terms being cut in half as tenants seek short-term solutions and deffer decision-making. ""We think that there will be significant leasing activity in the latter half of the year."" According to Atkinson, the pandemic has been an opportunity to rethink how companies use their space and attract employees. ""Before, our focus was attracting millennials. Now it's how do we make the senior partners who have been working from home (or their second home) feel comfortable and want to come back?"" asked Atkinson. ""We think it's driving a flight towards quality."" If Hines can sign up tenants for T3, the Goose Island project is positioned to move forward relatively quickly. The development complies with the site's current zoning and will not need to go through the city's approval process. ""It takes very little time to construct these buildings. We can go from a hole in the ground to outfitting tenant spaces in 10 to 15 months. Raw material costs are up, but there are savings in the cost of execution.""   ",Goose Island
"Plan to build 2,650 residences on Goose Island moves forward","On Thursday evening, Onni Group will take the wraps off its long-rumored plan to turn the southern tip of Goose Island into a massive, multiphase development with 2,650 residential units.  The Vancouver-based developer will present its plans for the property located at 901 N. Halsted Street at a public webinar hosted by Neighbors of River West and Near North Unity Program. The proposed development, which also includes ""commercial uses,"" will replace a Greyhound bus maintenance facility. Greyhound put its 8-acre property up for sale in 2017, and Onni closed a deal to pay $38 million for the site in early 2019. Onni's Goose Island plans will require city zoning approval to move forward. The development team hasn't shared any site plans or renderings of the upcoming project, but it's a safe bet that it involves multiple high-rise apartment towers and waterfront open space, as outlined in the city's 2017 North Branch Framework Plan and design guidelines. Chicago architecture firm Lamar Johnson Collaborative posted a Greyhound Masterplan for a ""confidential client"" on its website, which provides some sense of the development's potential scale. It's unclear if LJC is actively involved in Onni's plans. It's possible the architect created the renderings as a conceptual design study or for a different developer eying the site. If approved, Onni's proposal would represent a major shift for Goose Island, which has long been home to industries, not people. A sweeping rezone of the North Branch Corridor opened the island and surrounding industrial land to mixed-use developments like Lincoln Yards, the River District, Triangle Square, and others. Thursday's online presentation for 901 N. Halsted is scheduled for 6:00 p.m. and all are encouraged to tune in. Zoom log-in information can be found on this meeting notice shared by the River North Residents Association.  ",Goose Island
Xchange Chicago to open tech training center in late 2024,"A tech workforce and training center will open in Greater Grand Crossing this year. Planned for the former Food and Paper Supply Company building at 7247 S. South Chicago, the center is being planned by Xchange Chicago, a non-profit formed by the Comer Education Campus, with the goal of inspiring the next generation of innovators. Set to cost $20 million, the project will offer jobs, apprenticeships and training opportunities in the tech industry while bringing a first-of-its-kind center to Greater Grand Crossing. Community partners, including CHAMPS Male Mentoring, Ring of Hope, Network for Young Adult Success and Community Neighborhood Initiatives, joined forces with the Comer Campus to create the tech hub. P33, a collaboration between business and tech leaders in the city, is also a partner in the Xchange. The 28,000-square-foot building will house commercial businesses, as well as a cafe and commercial kitchen operated by local entrepreneurs, said Greg Mooney, president and executive director of the Comer Science and Education Foundation.  The project received a $5 million community development grant from the city in Spring 2023, but the nonprofit is still raising money to reach the full amount of $20 million.

City Council approves TIF funding for The Ave,"The Chicago City Council has approved $18.25 million in TIF financing for The Ave. Chosen as the winner of the Chicago Ave Invest South/West RFP site back at the end of 2021, The Ave will occupy the property at 3601 W. Chicago between N. Central Park Ave and N. Monticello Ave, where it will replace the current Neighborhood Housing Services office and a one-story commercial building currently owned by the city.  Planned by KMW Communities, POAH and CEC, the four-story project will include 52 affordable apartments, 2,900 square feet of space for Neighborhood Housing Services, an innovation center measuring 2,900 square feet, and 1,800 square feet of available retail space. Parking for 32 cars will be included on the ground floor. With Gensler and Nia Architects working on the project, the design began with the intent to avoid a simple bar building. The current scheme looks to create a longer building with multiple components. The massing holds the corners at each intersection, carves the middle of the street frontage, and draws the eye into the center plaza space.  The portion along N. Central Park Ave is the tallest portion, creating a stronger presence on one corner. The longer portion of the building is shorter and stretches towards N. Monticello Ave. Dubbed The Stoop, the public space at the center will be the feature space of the project. With Site Design Group on the project, the plaza will be designed as a multi-use space that will be overlooked by a large screen wall that will house local artwork. Since being selected as the winner of the RFP, the design has changed due to program changes and affordability measures. The top floor of the taller volume was removed, and the NHS office space was moved from two floors of space in the taller volume over to the ground floor of the shorter volume. New residential units were added to the second floor of the taller volume. Rising 54 feet, removing the fifth floor will allow for a less expensive construction method that will make the project more affordable. The $44.6 million project will be funded with a variety of sources, including a $500,000 private loan, $18.25 million in TIF funding, $19.6 million in LIHTC equity, $4.2 million in Chicago Recovery Plan funds, and $2 million in Bond Reinvestment earnings.

The city will sell the four city-owned lots appraised at $262,000 for just $4 ($1 per lot). With City Council approval of the project’s funding and land sale, the development is fully entitled and can move forward with permitting and construction. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Humboldt Park
City Council approves Team Pioneros development,"The Chicago City Council has approved the Team Pioneros mixed-use development planned at 1614 N. Pulaski. Planned by Park Row Development, the development was chosen as the winner of the Humboldt Park Invest South/West RFP. Located at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Pulaski Rd, the project site is a vacant lot that is just to the north of the landmark Pioneer Bank Building.  Designed by JGMA, the nine-story building will hold a Chicago Public Library branch, 85 affordable residential units, a health clinic, and 58 parking spaces. The unit mix will consist of 27 one-beds targeted at 60% AMI, 3 one-beds targeted at 30% AMI, 25 two-beds targeted at 60% AMI, 5 two-beds targeted at 30% AMI, 10 three-beds targeted at 60% AMI, 5 three-beds targeted at 30% AMI, 6 four-beds targeted at 60% AMI, and 4 four-beds targeted at 30% AMI. The building’s design stretches the massing of the bank, continuing the history of the bank building and reflecting the Latinx community in the neighborhood. Rising 109 feet tall, the massing is broken up with horizontal and vertical expressions that are reminiscent of the bank’s facade.  The ground floor of the building will hold the new branch of the Chicago Public Library, with its space extending to the second floor via a sculptural learning stair. An opening on the ground floor will act as an open space for the community to gather with opportunities for street vendors to congregate. A community room will face this space that can be used by the public and by the library. Above that, the third floor will hold the 58 parking spaces, with the fourth-floor home to amenities including the Humboldt Park Health Counseling Services Center, laundry room, game room, fitness center, lounge, and outdoor terrace. The top five floors will hold all of the residential units, topped by a green roof and solar panels.  With City Council’s approval the site will be rezoned from B3-2 to B3-3 before instituting a Planned Development for the project. The developers are working on closing the purchase of the site which is privately owned and will need to secure funding before construction can begin. ",Humboldt Park
Committee on Design reviews The Ave,"The Committee on Design has reviewed The Ave. Chosen as the winner back at the end of 2021, The Ave will occupy the RFP site along W. Chicago Ave between N. Central Park Ave and N. Monticello Ave, where it will replace the current Neighborhood Housing Services office and a one-story commercial building currently owned by the city.  Planned by KMW Communities, POAH and CEC, the four-story project will include 49 affordable apartments, 2,900 square feet of space for Neighborhood Housing Services, an innovation center measuring 2,900 square feet, and 1,800 square feet of available retail space. The building’s unit mix will consist of 19 one-beds, 27 two-beds, and 3 three-beds. Parking for 32 cars will be included on the ground floor. With Gensler and Nia Architects working on the project, the design began with the intent to avoid a simple bar building. The current scheme looks to create a longer building with multiple components. The massing holds the corners at each intersection, carves the middle of the street frontage, and draws the eye into the center plaza space.  The portion along N. Central Park Ave is the tallest portion, creating a stronger presence on one corner. The longer portion of the building is shorter and stretches towards N. Monticello Ave. Dubbed The Stoop, the public space at the center will be the feature space of the project. With Site Design Group on the project, the plaza will be designed as a multi-use space that will be overlooked by a large screen wall that will house local artwork. Since being selected as the winner of the RFP, the design has changed due to program changes and affordability measures. The top floor of the taller volume was removed, and the NHS office space was moved from two floors of space in the taller volume over to the ground floor of the shorter volume. New residential units were added to the second floor of the taller volume. Rising 49 feet, removing the fifth floor will allow for a less expensive construction method that will make the project more affordable. The building will be clad in a gridded brick facade with wood veneer accent panels and aluminum windows. At the ground floor, angled walls will also be clad in brick. Second floor residential units will have balconies that overlook the street and plaza. The discussion opened with Lesley Roth who liked the geometry of the building but commented that the angled walls needed refinement. Roth followed up with a comment that the second-floor facade still looks like office fenestration and needs to be coordinated with the new residential program behind it.  Sara Beardsley chimed in next to comment that the treatment of the massing was subtle but interesting and thought the feature wall was really nice. Beardsley said that the fortress-like walls at the ground floor could use more refinement. Brian Lee spoke next, asking if the design team considered having the parking garage access be from the alley. The development team responded that they did look at it but opted for a curb cut on N. Central Park Ave due to some concerns about overloading the alley which currently serves the residential neighborhood of single-family homes and two-flats. Lee felt the building was a good example of a well-planned mixed-use development and asked if they considered building taller to get more units. The development team said that 44 units was the original target (the building will now hold 49), and when the program was refined, they were able to fit everything in four floors and use a more affordable construction type.  Renauld Mitchell echoed the sentiments of the others and felt the project was well thought out. Mitchell asked whether the second-floor balconies were a remnant of the earlier scheme or if the intent was to preserve the look now that it is residential. The design team responded that they liked the reveal between the ground floor and upper floors, but it was a fair comment that it needs to look less commercial. With the Committee on Design review complete, the project will continue through the DPD review process. The project is reportedly proceeding under the existing zoning designation but will need city approval for acquiring the city-owned land and if the project ends up requesting city funding. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Humboldt Park
Foundation permit issued for 2933 W. Division,"A foundation permit has been issued for a new fitness center building at 2933 W. Division. Located at the corner of W. Division St and N. Richmond St, the project is part of a large master plan envisioned by Humboldt Park Health. The new construction will replace a vacant lot as well as an old two-story home and garage owned by the hospital that is currently unoccupied. Designed by JGMA, the project will consist of a three-story building spanning 45,500 square feet. The ground floor will feature the corner entry, an indoor pool, a sports medicine space, and a kids club. The second floor will be home to open fitness space, exercise rooms and an indoor track around the perimeter of the building. On the top floor, community rooms and lecture spaces will be grouped to create a community asset with an outdoor terrace finishing up the top floor. Dubbed the Humboldt Park Health Wellness Center, the project is aimed to promote healthy lifestyles while aiming to be a beacon of health and wellness for the entire campus. The project is charged as a connector between the hospital and the larger community, creating an asset that can be a protagonist for health and wellness. Rising 62 feet, the building’s facade will wrap around the volume, while rising up at the corner to announce the entry and create a clear procession into the building. Made up of a glass and metal system, the design is intended to evoke the idea of breathing, reinforcing the idea of health and wellness within the community. The $24 million project can now begin construction with All Masonry Construction as the general contractor. A timeline for completion is currently unknown. ",Humboldt Park

Hyde Park Union Church is officially a Chicago landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved a landmark designation for Hyde Park Union Church. Located at 5600 S. Woodlawn, the church was built in 1906 by architect James Gamble Rogers, with an addition built in 1926 by architects Morison and Wallace. Meeting Criterion 1 for its heritage, the history of Hyde Park Union Church goes as far back as 1874 when the First Baptist Church of Hyde Park Congregation’s first home was a wood-framed structure at the corner of 54th and Dorchester. The original church building was demolished in preparation for the construction of a new church, and two lots to the west were purchased to construct the larger two-story Richardsonian Romanesque-style church. The church also meets Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Characteristics of the Richardsonian Romanesque style seen on the building include rusticated red stone walls and corner towers. The Interior of the sanctuary is designed as a grand space for worship, with 6 large heavy timber open trusses with herringbone patterned ceilings in between. Stained glass windows and a rose window were added over time. The church also meets Criterion 5 as a work of a significant architect or designer. James Gamble Rogers was a prolific architect who completed a mixture of residential and institutional buildings such as Harkness Tower at Yale University, Northwestern University Chicago Campus, and Blaine Hall at the University of Chicago.   It was also determined that Hyde Park Union Church meets the Integrity Criterion as it has maintained its historical character over the past several decades and has only undergone minor changes that are typical for buildings of its age. This included some in-kind replacement of clay roof tiles.   With the landmark designation approved, the building cannot be demolished. The protected features will include all exterior elevations and rooflines as well as the entrance at the vestibule and sanctuary, including the overall spatial volume and historic decorative finishes and features.  ",Hyde Park
Core and shell permit issued for UChicago Cancer Center,"A core and shell permit has been issued for UChicago Medicine’s free standing cancer center at 5654 S. Drexel. Planned for a site along W. 57th St between S. Drexel Ave and S. Maryland Ave, the 575,000-square-foot facility will provide patients and the community access to the newest diagnostic innovations and leading-edge therapies. Building a world-class cancer center, the university has tapped CannonDesign to design the eight-story building which will be topped with a mechanical penthouse and set into the ground with a lower-level support floor. The 172-foot-tall building has been designed with a series of curved indentations that increase the facade area to allow for more rooms along the exterior and for daylight to reach further into the building. Made up of glass and metal paneling, the facade’s ribbons change opacity to create movement and flow around the building. The building will include 80 private beds dedicated to patients with cancer, split between 64 medical-surgical and 16 ICU. To accommodate overnight stays, family space will be included. 90 consultation and outpatient exam rooms will be included in the building, while a rapid assessment/urgent care clinic will be provided separately to protect immunocompromised oncology patients from exposure to other patients. Bridges will connect to the adjacent parking garage and other hospital tower to the south. More spaces provided by the facility will include infusion therapy rooms grouped by cancer type to replace an outdated open design; cancer imaging equipment (two MRIs, two CT scanners, two ultrasound units, two procedure rooms with mobile C-arm/fluoroscopy and an X-ray); a breast center that will include screening and diagnostic imaging and biopsy rooms; dedicated clinical trial spaces, for streamlined access to the latest research; a center focused on prevention, detection, treatment and survival, offering complementary therapies, stress reduction, community education and well-being support; as well as shell space that can expand vertically and horizontally, providing flexibility for future growth and technology. Outside of the building, the design takes cues from biophilia, with a large pocket park at the southeast corner of the site that connects the campus and becomes a place of respite. A drop-off area along S. Drexel Ave brings cars off the street and is surrounded by landscaping to help create a relaxing and calming space to enter the building. Set to cost $815 million, the new center is expected to serve 200,000 outpatient visits and 5,000 inpatient admissions annually. Construction of the foundations have begun with the two tower cranes already installed. With the core and shell permit issued, general contractor Turner Construction Company can build the full structural framing, shear walls, and building enclosure as well as fireproofing, egress stairs, elevator shafts, roofing, and accessories. The pedestrian bridges over S. Maryland Ave and E. 57th St are also included in the permit. With work underway, construction will continue through late 2026, with the facility planned to open to patients in 2027.  ",Hyde Park

Construction tops out at Hyde Park Labs,"Trammell Crow Company and Beacon Capital Partners have announced that construction has topped out at Hyde Park Labs in Chicago. The South Side’s first commercial, purpose-built advanced R&D lab, Hyde Park Labs is in the diverse and vibrant neighborhood of Hyde Park, located at 5207 S. Harper. The building is expected to welcome its first tenants in early 2025, after the delivery of the base building in Q4 2024. The University of Chicago has already pre-leased approximately 55,000 square feet at the building, which will house a half-floor incubator space to support early-stage science research. “Hyde Park Labs is situated at the epicenter of the Hyde Park downtown neighborhood, where there has been tremendous innovation driven in large part by the transformative deep tech, medical and quantum research and entrepreneurship led by the University of Chicago,” said TCC’s Morgan Baer-Blaska. “The proximity and partnership with this world-class institution allows us to further support a science ecosystem that is already growing rapidly in this market. Designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects and Interactive Design architects, the 13-story building will have more than 300,000 square feet, featuring nine full floors of Class A lab and office space, as well as activated ground-level retail and lobby. Parking will be available on one level of below-grade and three floors of above-grade space. The facility will include 40,000 square feet of tenant amenities, including a fifth-floor terrace dubbed “The Lawn” that will feature grills, firepits, views of Lake Michigan and connection to the interior tenant lounge. The building will also offer private terraces on every floor, secure on-site bike storage, an indoor bar and lounge, an executive boardroom, as well as a STEM engagement center for students on the ground floor. “Chicago’s strong employment base and its standing as a top research cluster in the US make Hyde Park Labs, through its partnership with the University of Chicago, a vital and innovative location to attract and support the incubation of early and growth stage companies on the cutting edge of scientific and technological discovery,” said Fred Seigel, President and CEO, Beacon Capital Partners.  Hyde Park Labs is the second phase of development at Harper Court, which currently includes a hotel, an office building that houses UChicago administrative offices, and retail space. The TCC/Beacon development plan and design was crafted to create an innovative R&D and science hub with direct community benefits. As the City of Chicago aims to strengthen its position as a technology and advanced sciences hub, the project will contribute lab space and infrastructure needed to support that ecosystem, including nine floors of lab-enabled space and heavy infrastructure for lab or technology uses. The project will feature a range of spaces to meet the needs of startups, interim-stage companies, and larger corporations, including shared wet or dry lab and office space. The building will also include new levels of parking, ground-floor retail and community space, and outdoor green space, as well as a full-time community engagement specialist to lead programming. Power Construction and Ujamaa Construction have created a joint venture to deliver the building by Q4 2024 with tenants moving in Q1 2025. ",Hyde Park

Promontory Point is finally a landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation of Promontory Point. Located east of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable Lake Shore Drive, the promontory sits between 54th and 56th streets in Hyde Park. Built in the 1920s and 30s, the parkland is a peninsula of artificial landfill whose landscaping was designed by Alfred Caldwell.  The curving landform is surrounded by the last remaining limestone revetments along the entire lakefront, providing views of the city and access to the lake. A circular path goes around the promontory with a large, open meadow in the center. Important features include the pavilion building designed by Emmanuel V. Buchsbaum, the David Wallach Fountain by sculptors Frederick C. Hibbard and Elizabeth Hazeltine, and four council rings designed by Caldwell. Landmarks staff determined that Promontory Point meets four criteria for landmarking, including Criterion 1 for heritage. Built as part of Burnham’s ambitious lakefront expansion, Promontory Point was an integral part of the development of new green space in the early 20th century. To create the land, revetments were installed. The process began by driving wood piles into the lake and tying them together with steel bands. The cribs as they called them were filled in with stones and once the site behind it was infilled, cut limestone blocks were set on top of those cribs and up against the new landfill to prevent erosion. After the Great Depression, WPA funds from the New Deal helped fund the completion of Promontory Point and the construction of the pavilion building.   The next criterion is Criterion 4 for exemplary architecture. Alfred Caldwell was tapped to design Promontory Point, where he created a scene of an open meadow framed by irregular groupings of greenery that gave a sense of enclosure and framed views out towards the lake and city. This center space drastically contrasted with the limestone revetments that edged the perimeter. Emmanuel Buchsbaum, who was the Park District’s head architect, designed the pavilion building in a French Eclectic style that was uncommon for the era. The building was designed with a round tower and conical roof at the intersection of two asymmetric gabled roof wings.  The Point also meets Criterion 5 for being the work of significant architects and designers. Alfred Caldwell was a great 20th century landscape designer whose tenure included time at the Chicago Park District where he was quickly given the most ambitious and high-profile projects due to his knowledge and design skills. Emmanuel V. Buchsbaum began his career as a draftsman before he spent almost his entire career at the Chicago Park District except for a few years where he worked on the State Street subway. Frederick C Hibbard and Elizabeth Hazeltine were husband and wife artists who both studied at the School of the Art Institute before working on a wide body of work that extends around the country. The final criterion is Criterion 7 for its unique or distinct visual features. Although landfill created new green space from Grant Park to Jackson Park, Promontory Point is the only peninsula on the lakeshore. From its earliest days, Chicagoans have used it for all kinds of group outings, gatherings, and recreation.  As set forth by the landmarks staff, the designation would protect all exterior elevations and rooflines of the pavilion building, as well as the pathways, council rings, the David Wallach Fountain, and the limestone revetments. Alfred Caldwell’s landscape design of a central meadow edged by irregular groupings of plants and trees would also be included, but routine landscape maintenance would be excluded from review.  With the City Council’s approval, the decades-long fight to landmark and preserve Promontory Point has achieved a major victory. From now on, any proposed work to the point will need a thorough review by landmarks staff, shielding the last remaining limestone revetments from being removed and replaced with steel and concrete like the rest of the lakefront.

More spaces provided by the facility will include infusion therapy rooms grouped by cancer type to replace an outdated open design; cancer imaging equipment (two MRIs, two CT scanners, two ultrasound units, two procedure rooms with mobile C-arm/fluoroscopy and an X-ray); a breast center that will include screening and diagnostic imaging and biopsy rooms; dedicated clinical trial spaces, for streamlined access to the latest research; a center focused on prevention, detection, treatment and survival, offering complementary therapies, stress reduction, community education and well-being support; as well as shell space that can expand vertically and horizontally, providing flexibility for future growth and technology. Outside of the building, the design takes cues from biophilia, with a large pocket park at the southeast corner of the site that connects the campus and becomes a place of respite. A drop-off area along S. Drexel Ave brings cars off the street and is surrounded by landscaping to help create a relaxing and calming space to enter the building. Set to cost $815 million, the new center is expected to serve 200,000 outpatient visits and 5,000 inpatient admissions annually. The organization expects to break ground this fall and finish up construction in late 2026, opening to patients in 2027.  ",Hyde Park
Promontory Point gets final landmark recommendation,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark designation for Promontory Point. Located east of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable Lake Shore Drive, the promontory sits between 54th and 56th streets in Hyde Park. Built in the 1920s and 30s, the parkland is a peninsula of artificial landfill whose landscaping was designed by Alfred Caldwell.  The curving landform is surrounded by the last remaining limestone revetments along the entire lakefront, providing views of the city and access to the lake. A circular path goes around the promontory with a large, open meadow in the center. Important features include the pavilion building designed by Emmanuel V. Buchsbaum, the David Wallach Fountain by sculptors Frederick C. Hibbard and Elizabeth Hazeltine, and four council rings designed by Caldwell. Landmarks staff determined that Promontory Point meets four criteria for landmarking, including Criterion 1 for heritage. Built as part of Burnham’s ambitious lakefront expansion, Promontory Point was an integral part of the development of new green space in the early 20th century. To create the land, revetments were installed. The process began by driving wood piles into the lake and tying them together with steel bands. The cribs as they called them were filled in with stones and once the site behind it was infilled, cut limestone blocks were set on top of those cribs and up against the new landfill to prevent erosion. After the Great Depression, WPA funds from the New Deal helped fund the completion of Promontory Point and the construction of the pavilion building.   The next criterion is Criterion 4 for exemplary architecture. Alfred Caldwell was tapped to design Promontory Point, where he created a scene of an open meadow framed by irregular groupings of greenery that gave a sense of enclosure and framed views out towards the lake and city. This center space drastically contrasted with the limestone revetments that edged the perimeter. Emmanuel Buchsbaum, who was the Park District’s head architect, designed the pavilion building in a French Eclectic style that was uncommon for the era. The building was designed with a round tower and conical roof at the intersection of two asymmetric gabled roof wings.  The Point also meets Criterion 5 for being the work of significant architects and designers. Alfred Caldwell was a great 20th century landscape designer whose tenure included time at the Chicago Park District where he was quickly given the most ambitious and high profile projects due to his knowledge and design skills. Emmanuel V. Buchsbaum began his career as a draftsman before he spent almost his entire career at the Chicago Park District except for a few years where he worked on the State Street subway. Frederick C Hibbard and Elizabeth Hazeltine were husband and wife artists who both studied at the School of the Art Institute before working on a wide body of work that extends around the country. The final criterion is Criterion 7 for its unique or distinct visual features. Although landfill created new green space from Grant Park to Jackson Park, Promontory Point is the only peninsula on the lakeshore. From its earliest days, Chicagoans have used it for all kinds of group outings, gatherings, and recreation.  As set forth by the landmarks staff, the designation would protect all exterior elevations and rooflines of the pavilion building, as well as the pathways, council rings, the David Wallach Fountain, and the limestone revetments. Alfred Caldwell’s landscape design of a central meadow edged by irregular groupings of plants and trees would also be included, but routine landscape maintenance would be excluded from review.  With the Chicago Park District’s Board of Directors consenting to the designation, the approval of the landmark designation was a high point for the commission, Alderman Leslie Hairston, and the community who have advocated for its conservation for decades. The proposed designation will now head to City Hall for votes from the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council. Moving forward, the designation would then require any work proposed for Promontory Point to be reviewed by landmarks staff prior to anything being done on the site.  ",Hyde Park
Hyde Park Labs begins vertical construction,"Trammell Crow Company and Beacon Capital Partners recently announced that vertical construction is underway at Hyde Park Labs. Located on the corner of E. 52nd St and S. Harper Ave, the project is next to the UChicago’s Harper Court offices and a few blocks from UChicago’s main Hyde Park campus and the University of Chicago Medical Center.  Designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects and Interactive Design Architects, Hyde Park Labs will rise 14 stories and will include ground-level retail, lobby and loading space, and nine floors of Class A lab and office space measuring 302,388 square feet. Parking will be available on one level of below-grade space, as well as space on floors two to four. Tenants of Hyde Park Labs will have access to nearly 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a fifth-floor terrace dubbed “The Lawn,” which will feature grills, fire pits, views of Lake Michigan and connection to the interior tenant lounge. The building will also offer private terraces on every floor, secure on-site bike storage, an indoor bar and lounge, an executive boardroom, as well as activated ground-floor retail. The developers are pursuing LEED, WELL, & U.S. Green Building Council certifications for the building. Marking the second phase of development at Harper Court, Hyde Park Labs will join a hotel, an office building housing many UChicago administrative offices, and retail space that already exists on the site. The TCC/Beacon development plan and design was crafted to create an innovative life science hub with direct community benefits. The project will strengthen the City of Chicago’s growing life sciences ecosystem, and at the same time create the advanced lab infrastructure needed to support a science and technology hub on the South Side, leveraging its location alongside the University of Chicago. The building is projected to contribute to the vibrancy of the community, adding a significant new workforce in the neighborhood that will help support local retail and restaurants. The University of Chicago has pre-leased one and a half floors of the building totaling 55,000 square feet, a portion of which will house researchers from the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. Space will also be used to develop an incubator program to support startup companies focused on the life sciences. “The University of Chicago is one of the world’s leading academic institutions, renowned for driving innovation across many disciplines, including biosciences and quantum. We’re proud that through the development of Hyde Park Labs, the University will be able to further support the incubation of early and growth stage companies on the cutting edge of scientific and technological discovery,” said Fred Seigel, President and CEO, Beacon Capital Partners. “We’re also excited for our first opportunity to partner with Trammell Crow as we bring this project to life in Chicago.” The development team and the University of Chicago are committed to fostering engagement and inclusion within the advanced science and technology building, including the dedication of 2,500 square feet of community space with programming for STEM students, teaching spaces, and university mentorship. The development team has also committed to funding a Community Engagement Program, which will include an annual community support fund to support STEM programming with local students, in addition to hiring a full-time community engagement coordinator that will operate and manage the community space. The project will also commit greater than 40% of construction and operations spend towards minority and women-owned businesses. With construction in progress, general contractors Power Construction and Ujamaa Construction have teamed up for the project. With demolition and tower crane permits issued, work will go vertical very soon with a completion date set for late 2024. ",Hyde Park
UChicago Medicine plans free standing cancer center,"UChicago Medicine has detailed their plans for Chicago’s first free standing cancer center. Planned for a site along W. 57th St between S. Drexel Ave and S. Maryland Ave, the 575,000-square-foot facility will provide patients and the community access to the newest diagnostic innovations and leading-edge therapies. Building a world-class cancer center, the university has tapped CannonDesign to design the seven-story building which will be topped with a mechanical penthouse and set into the ground with a lower-level support floor. Set to cost $815 million, the new center is expected to serve 200,000 outpatient visits and 5,000 inpatient admissions annually. The building will include 80 private beds dedicated to patients with cancer, split between 64 medical-surgical and 16 ICU. To accommodate overnight stays, family space will be included. 90 consultation and outpatient exam rooms will be included in the building, while a rapid assessment/urgent care clinic will be provided separately to protect immunocompromised oncology patients from exposure to other patients. More spaces provided by the facility will include infusion therapy rooms grouped by cancer type to replace an outdated open design; cancer imaging equipment (two MRIs, two CT scanners, two ultrasound units, two procedure rooms with mobile C-arm/fluoroscopy and an X-ray); a breast center that will include screening and diagnostic imaging and biopsy rooms; dedicated clinical trial spaces, for streamlined access to the latest research; a center focused on prevention, detection, treatment and survival, offering complementary therapies, stress reduction, community education and well-being support; as well as shell space that can expand vertically and horizontally, providing flexibility for future growth and technology. UChicago Medicine submitted a request to the state regulatory board seeking approval for the design and planned site for the proposed center back in January 2022. After holding a public meeting in February 2022, UChicago Medicine filed a subsequent certificate of need application for construction this past Fall 2022.  The organization expects construction to start in the latter half of 2023 depending on regulatory approval with the cancer center set to open to patients in 2027.  ",Hyde Park
Harper Court Phase 2 set to kickoff,"Work is set to kick off on the second phase of Harper Courts. Located in Hyde Park, the project site is an irregular shaped lot on the block bound by E. 52nd St to the north, S. Lake Park Ave to the east, E. 53rd St to the south, and S. Harper Ave to the west. With Harper Court bisecting the project, an office building and retail podium has already been built at the southeast corner, with a hotel occupying the slender site along S. Harper Ave bound by S. Harper Court to the north and east. In collaboration with University of Chicago, developers Beacon Capital Partners and Trammell Crow have teamed up to develop the northwest corner of the block. Currently occupied in part by the existing Harper Court Phase 1 retail podium and by the Park 52 restaurant building, the new project will be built on top of the existing retail and will replace the restaurant. With Elkus Manfredi Architects, Interactive Design Architects, and Moody Nolan working together on the design, the project reflects a shifted scope from the earlier proposal. Planned as a world-class research facility, the research lab building will stand 13 floors, encompassing 295,000 square feet of leasable lab space, of which University of Chicago will lease 50,000 square feet. While the previous version called for a taller tower overlooking S. Lake Park Ave, the new scope will allow for larger floor plates for tenants while reducing the height down to 215 feet.  At the ground floor, existing retail space along Harper Court will be retained and built on top of while approximately 4,000 square feet of new retail space will front the northwest corner of the block. The expanded podium will hold 125 new parking stalls while offering a new amenity deck that will stretch over to S. Lake Park Ave. A mechanical floor and parking will separate the ground floor from the upper nine floors of lab space.  The developers have tapped Power Construction and Ujamaa Construction as joint venture partners acting as the general contractor for the project. A permit to demolish the restaurant building has been issued and will be completed by Taylor Excavating and Construction. Work on the new building is set to follow immediately after with a goal for occupancy in Q2 2024. ",Hyde Park

Plantings and trees have been specifically excluded at this time. The next step for the designation would be a report and final landmark recommendation from the commission which could come as soon as next month. If there are no issues, the City Council could adopt the landmark designation by the end of April. Once the presentation ended, the hearing turned into a heated discussion between city officials and preservationists about the details of the plan for repairing the limestone. Local alderman Leslie Hairston criticized the Park District and CDOT for leaving her out of discussions about next steps for the limestone revetments and for a plan to replace the limestone with concrete that was apparently included in an unreleased document from CDOT and SmithGroup. This document was found out to be the Lakefront Strategic Action Plan that was contracted with SmithGroup back in 2019. Hairston said, “If this [project] is to be done in anything other than limestone, it is a no-go for the community.” Park District and Department of Transportation officials both went on the record in the meeting to say they’re “in complete agreement” with the community and will be pursuing the locally preferred plan. To this Jack Spicer, Founder of Promontory Point Conservancy, criticized that the  “locally preferred plan”  was to demolish the limestone and replace it with concrete which was absolutely not the community’s preferred plan. CDOT Deputy Commissioner Dan Burke who joined the call on short notice pushed back on Spicer’s reference to what was apparently a plan from all the way back in 2005 saying, “Can we stop discussing 2005? Let's put it to rest,"" Burke said. “We’re committed to a plan reusing the existing limestone and doing it as part of a rehabilitation that will be consistent with the Secretary of Interior’s standards for historic preservation.” Park District representative Heather Gleason also reaffirmed their commitment saying, “I understand the community’s fear about it, but I want to be clear: The Chicago Park District, as the property owner of Promontory Point, our intention is to follow the community’s wishes to maintain and preserve the limestone.” Moving on, the commission voted to approve the landmark designation and the meeting ended. With this landmark status moving forward, the ultimate designation would then require any work proposed for Promontory Point to be reviewed by landmarks staff prior to anything being done on the site.    ",Hyde Park

University of Chicago parking structure lands full building permit,"Full building permits have been issued for the Campus South Multi-Use Facility. Located at 1306 E 61st Street, the new structure will be replacing the site’s existing field house and single-story building at 6047 S. Kimbark Avenue.  Demolition permits for that structure were issued in late August of 2021.  Designed by bKL Architecture, the four-story project will provide 323 parking spots, as well as a parking office, a meeting/community room, and support space for the school’s adjacent athletic fields. Rising 51 feet, the structure will be clad with a rhythmic vertical metal panel that provides a texture to the building volume while allowing for natural ventilation for the parking floors. Per UChicago’s website, the massing of the building will provide a transition from the university campus to the residential district south of 61st Street. The color of the materials was chosen to integrate the building into its context, by drawing from the warm natural color of the limestone found in wall panels and accent stones throughout the community.  The primary vehicle entrance and exit will be on the north side of the parcel, aligned with S Kimbark Avenue which is a vacated street. Cars can also access the parking via E 61st Street. The main pedestrian entrance will be an elevator lobby at the northwest corner, aligning with the Rubenstein Forum and Study Hotel.

22-story apartment tower headed to Illinois Medical District,"Work is ready to get underway on a 22-story rental tower at the southeast corner of Damen Avenue and Congress Parkway in the Illinois Medical District (IMD). Earlier week, developer Marquette Cos. landed a building permit to begin construction on the 230-foot building's caisson foundations. The Near West Side high-rise is allowed under the site's existing zoning, and Power Construction is listed as the general contractor on the permit.   Designed by Brininstool + Lynch, the tower headed to 513 S. Damen Avenue contains 279 apartments, a small ground-floor retail space, and parking for 172 cars on levels one through three. The upcoming building will rise immediately west of the 18-story former Medical Center Apartments which Marquette recently rehabbed and rebranded as the 272-unit Atio Apartments. The site is currently occupied by a surface parking lot. Marquette also plans a third shorter rental building on the southern edge of the site along Harrison Street, which will rise nine stories. Also designed by Brininstool + Lynch, the Harrison building will include 120 apartments, provide additional retail space, and share the parking garage and a fourth-floor amenity deck of the neighboring tower about to break ground on Damen.  According to Marquette's president and chief investment officer Darren Sloniger, the IMD is experiencing a high demand for new apartments. ""People want to live there because they can walk to the L and walk to work,"" Sloniger told Crain's Chicago Business back in July.

Crews put finishing touches on Atrio apartments in Illinois Medical District ,"The effort to transform the outdated high-rise at 1926 W. Harrison Street into contemporary apartments is nearing completion in the Illinois Medical District on Chicago's Near West Side. Dubbed Atrio, the project has finished re-cladding the 18-story, 1960s-era Medical Center Apartments by swapping out the existing structure's precast concrete panels for new floor-to-ceiling glass. The renovation work, led by general contractor Focus Construction, is far more than skin deep. The tower's existing 306 residential units were gut-rehabbed into modern 272 rental units offered in studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom layouts. Fifty-two of the apartments are set aside as affordable housing. Developed by Marquette Cos. and designed by Brininstool + Lynch, Atrio features new amenities including a resident lounge, a fitness center, and co-working spaces. The estimated $40 million renovation also extended elevator access to the tower's roof, which was reimagined as an outdoor terrace boasting new seating, grilling stations, and sweeping skyline views.  Atrio welcomed its first new residents in late May. As construction work winds down, the project's developers will next set their sights on a pair of new-construction residential buildings that will rise 22 and nine stories on open land just south of Atrio, reported Chicago YIMBY.  These projects, along with the upcoming Gateway Apartments and the ongoing Harrison Square redevelopment of Cook County Hospital real estate, are all encouraging signs for the Illinois Medical District.

Phebe and John Gray House is officially a Chicago landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark design of the Phebe and John Gray House in Irving Park. Located at 4362 W. Grace, the 1850s home is a two-story wood-frame Italianate-style residence with a third-story cupola.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Gray House represents the Irving Park neighborhood’s early stage as rural farmland in Jefferson Township, prior to annexation by the City of Chicago. The Gray House’s proportions and large corner lot harken back to a time preceding the advent of suburban subdivisions. The juxtaposition of the Gray House with the repeating pattern of standardized house lots that surround it speaks to the development of Chicago’s “railroad suburbs” in the 19th century.  Also meeting Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture, the home is an excellent example of 19th-century mail-order pattern-book architecture, a design and distribution method popularly used in suburban development. It is a great example of residential architecture in the Italianate style, an architectural style of great significance in the history of Chicago and the United States. It possesses numerous features distinctive to the style, including its asymmetric footprint, arcaded porches, arched-header windows, shallow-gabled roofs, overhanging eaves supported by cornice brackets, balustraded balconies, and a three-story tower with cupola. The Gray House also meets the separate Integrity Criterion as it retains its historic overall exterior form and almost all exterior materials, features and detailing. Changes to the Gray House are minor and include the replacement of the original roof shingles with asphalt shingles, the expansion of the original front stoop with a wraparound porch, and minimal window alterations towards the rear of the original house. In 1989 and 2008, the home was expanded by removing portions of the Italianate’s rear wall to accommodate a two-story extension at the far north end of the building. In 2023, the current owners had the house repainted, choosing to replace the yellow exterior with a deep shade of red. Details of the Italianate’s ornamental trim are showcased by the new polychrome paint treatment. With the landmark designation official, the building is now shielded from demolition or compromising alterations. T significant features to be protected are all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building. Excluded from the significant features is the garage at the northeast corner of the lot, which was permitted for construction in 1989. ",Irving Park

Phebe and John Gray House gets final landmark recommendation,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the Phebe and John Gray House in Irving Park. Located at 4362 W. Grace, the 1850s home is a two-story wood-frame Italianate-style residence with a third-story cupola.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Gray House represents the Irving Park neighborhood’s early stage as rural farmland in Jefferson Township, prior to annexation by the City of Chicago. The Gray House’s proportions and large corner lot harken back to a time preceding the advent of suburban subdivisions. The juxtaposition of the Gray House with the repeating pattern of standardized house lots that surround it speaks to the development of Chicago’s “railroad suburbs” in the 19th century.  Also meeting Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture, the home is an excellent example of 19th-century mail-order pattern-book architecture, a design and distribution method popularly used in suburban development. It is a great example of residential architecture in the Italianate style, an architectural style of great significance in the history of Chicago and the United States. It possesses numerous features distinctive to the style, including its asymmetric footprint, arcaded porches, arched-header windows, shallow-gabled roofs, overhanging eaves supported by cornice brackets, balustraded balconies, and a three-story tower with cupola. The Gray House also meets the separate Integrity Criterion as it retains its historic overall exterior form and almost all exterior materials, features and detailing. Changes to the Gray House are minor and include the replacement of the original roof shingles with asphalt shingles, the expansion of the original front stoop with a wraparound porch, and minimal window alterations towards the rear of the original house. In 1989 and 2008, the home was expanded by removing portions of the Italianate’s rear wall to accommodate a two-story extension at the far north end of the building. In 2023, the current owners had the house repainted, choosing to replace the yellow exterior with a deep shade of red. Details of the Italianate’s ornamental trim are showcased by the new polychrome paint treatment. The commission staff has recommended that the significant features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building. Excluded from the significant features is the garage at the northeast corner of the lot, which was permitted for construction in 1989. With the final landmark recommendation approved, the building is temporarily shielded from demolition. The landmark recommendation will be sent to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.  ",Irving Park
Affordable housing approved at 2907 W. Irving Park,"Alderman Rossana Rodriguez announced via an email to constituents that the Chicago City Council has approved the rezoning for an all-affordable residential development at 2907 W. Irving Park. Planned by developers Full Circle Communities and Visionary Ventures, the project will occupy a vacant site that is midblock between N. Richmond St and N. Francisco Ave near Horner Park and the north branch of the Chicago River. Designed by Canopy / architecture + design, the architecture was inspired by native culture, using a metaphor of the river in the design to express the native culture in the project. Topping out at 79 feet tall, the seven-story building has been designed with a serrated facade lined with east-facing balconies. The ground floor has been setback to provide an expanded sidewalk and landscaping and the seventh floor has been setback to reduce the perceived height and mass of the structure. Set to hold 45 units, the building will cluster community with a multigenerational set of apartments ranging from studios to three-beds. Units will be available at a range of incomes from 15-60% AMI. Designed in response to climate and culture, every unit will have an east-facing balcony to orient towards the morning sun and connect to the Chicago River nearby.    The ground floor of the building will face W. Irving Park Rd with the residential lobby, the bike room with 45 spaces, and a commercial space that will be reserved for a Native American non-profit or service organization. Parking for 16 cars will be at the back of the ground floor accessible from the alley. At the top of the building, the seventh floor will hold amenity spaces including a community room and kitchen, an art/maker space, coworking space, and a fitness center. The setbacks will be used as expansive outdoor terraces both on the north and south side of the rooftop connecting to the river and downtown. Currently zoned RS-1, the approved rezoning to B3-3 will allow for the scope of the development. In terms of timeline, the development team plans to begin construction in Spring 2024, starting pre-leasing in Winter 2024, and completing construction in Spring 2025.

Jefferson Park mixed-income rentals score first permit,"The first of two mixed-income apartment buildings slated for a long-vacant lot at 6001 W. Lawrence Avenue in Jefferson Park has scored a construction permit. Known as Lawrence & Austin Apartments, the project from nonprofit developer Full Circle Communities aims to address the shortfall of affordable housing for veterans, people with disabilities, seniors, and families on the city's far Northwest Side. Designed by Chicago-based Canopy Architecture + Design, the newly permitted building will rise four stories and contain 26 rental units. A second four-story building with 22 apartments is planned next door. The complex will include amenities such as community rooms, laundry facilities, a computer lab and library, a children’s activity room, and bike storage. A landscaped plaza with seating and grilling areas will be located between the two structures, and a total of 34 parking spaces will be provided at the rear of the site. The buildings will be clad earthy tones such as rose and green as ""a nod to the Illinois prairie landscape,"" according to Canopy's designers. The estimated $20 million project does not rely on city funding but will take advantage of $1.5 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credits from the Illinois Housing Development Authority. The permit estimates the scope of the work on the first building at roughly $6.9 million and lists Henry Bros. Co. as the general contractor. The upcoming development is moving forward despite opposition from Ald. Nick Sposato (38th), who claimed the plan was too dense and included too few parking spaces, according to WTTW Chicago. The city's Committee on Zoning ultimately rejected Sposato's efforts to block the Lawrence & Austin Apartments and voted in favor of the project last fall.   The Lawrence and Austin buildings represent the second mixed-income housing development in Jefferson Park from Full Circle Communities. Earlier this year, the developer completed a seven-story complex with 15 market-rate and 60 affordable apartments at 5150 Northwest Highway. Despite also facing fierce opposition from NIMBY groups, the Northwest Side project received more than 700 applications for its 75 residences, reported Block Club Chicago.  ",Jefferson Park
Jefferson Park condo plan fails to impress alderman,"The local alderman in Jefferson Park has asked the developer behind a low-rise condominium proposal to redesign their plans for a second time after their latest plan received complaints from community members.  Hudson Construction Services initially proposed a four-story project with a total of 24 units for the former United Methodist Church at 5850 N. Elston Avenue on Chicago's northwest side. Although the scope of the development was later reduced to a three-story complex with 18 for-sale units and 24 parking spaces, neighbors were still unsatisfied. At an in-person community meeting hosted last week by Ald. James Gardiner (45th), residents railed against the revised proposal, calling it too dense, too tall, and not providing enough on-site parking. More than 50 people attended the meeting yet only one individual spoke in favor of the development, according to Block Club Chicago. On Friday, Ald. Gardiner said in his newsletter that he will not support the latest plan and has requested the developers to go back to the drawing board. ""Based on community feedback, I have asked the developer for 5850 N. Elston to submit another proposal that will be more accepting from residents of our community,"" said Gardiner. ""Stay tuned."" The development team sought a zoning change from RS-3 to a B2-2, which would require Gardiner's support. The 24,500-square-foot property at 5850 N. Elston has been up for sale for over a year. The United Methodist Church shut down its Jefferson Park facility after merging with another church. ",Jefferson Park
Developer pitches 18 condos in Jefferson Park,"Hudson Construction Services plans to redevelop 5850 N. Elston Avenue into a trio of condominium buildings with six residences each. The site is currently home to the Elston Avenue United Methodist Church, which put their 24,500-square-foot Jefferson Park property up for sale after merging with another church.  The team initially proposed a four-story project with a total of 24 units for the site, but that design was met with backlash. The team presented a quick glimpse at the revised plans at a virtual meeting held Monday evening by Ald. James Gardiner (45th).  ""There was community concern due to the height and how many residents would be living there,"" said Gardiner on Monday. ""After some discussion with the developer he is now seeking a zoning change from RS-3 to a B2-2 instead of a B2-3.""  Designed by architect Richard Rasmussen, the scaled-back development now calls for three 3-story buildings rising roughly 38 feet. Each structure would contain two units per floor: the ground floor (and lower level) would contain ""duplex-down"" condos with three bedrooms plus a flex room, while the second and third floors each house a pair of two-bedroom residences. ""We've designed large front outdoor spaces for each of the units, that are approximately 160 square feet,"" said developer Michelangelo Siracki. ""Due to the new COVID realities about living and working from home, we wanted to be sure that every unit had ample outdoor space that was covered."" The proposal includes 24 rear parking spaces as well as a small private pocket park along Mamora Avenue. Unfortunately due to an unforeseen technical snafu, the development team was not able to share their screen during the presentation and resorted to holding up a tablet displaying renderings of the project. After several frustrating minutes, Ald. Gardiner cut the meeting short saying his office would instead host an in-person community gathering at a later date to be determined.   Monday's abridged presentation did include a brief Q&A period allowing a handful of neighbors an opportunity to complain. Comments included concerns over the project's height (still?) and a perceived lack of parking. One resident expressed fear that a zoning change for one development could somehow set off a runaway ""chain reaction"" of up-zoning across the entire neighborhood.  Stay tuned for more.  ",Jefferson Park
Controversial mixed-income housing project nears completion in Jefferson Park,"After enduring controversy that included a lawsuit from local NIMBYs, an upcoming mixed-income housing project is entering the home stretch at 5150 Northwest Highway in Jefferson Park. The seven-story complex from nonprofit developer Full Circle Communities and architect Cordogan, Clark & Associates broke ground in 2019 and has reached its final height at the intersection of Northwest Highway and Milwaukee Avenue.  The building will soon deliver 15 market-rate and 60 affordable apartments offered in studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom floorplans. One-hundred percent of the units will be prioritized for veterans and persons with a disability, according to the development team. The plan also includes parking for 40 cars and 5,500 square feet of commercial space that will be leased by nonprofit Friendship Community Place for offices and space for community events. Despite its proximity to mass transit, the Jefferson Park neighborhood has seen few multifamily developments in recent years. The Northwest Highway project received considerable pushback from some community members and was arguably a contributing factor in former Ald. John Arena losing reelection. In 2017 Arena responded to a lawsuit filed against him and the city by residents unhappy with the plan. ""We won't be bullied or discouraged from fighting for safe, accessible, reasonably priced housing for people with disabilities and those who bravely served our nation,"" he wrote on Facebook.  The apartments at 5150 Northwest Highway are currently on track to open later this year. Starting today, Full Circle Communities is offering applications for prospective tenants on its website.  ",Jefferson Park

Requesting $250,000 in Adopt-A-Landmark funds for the stained-glass window restoration, the overall restoration work will total $431,000. The restoration work comes as part of a larger investment in the building totaling approximately $2.1 million for exterior and roof work. For restoring the stained-glass windows, all of the vents will have their rusted surfaces ground smooth and reprimed with fresh paint. The glass panes will be cleaned and repaired where needed. On the exterior, all window protection glass will be removed and replaced with new plate glass fit to the exterior frames.  With JLK Architects on board, the project’s costs break down into $266,000 for restoration work, $75,000 for construction materials, $38,000 for scaffolding, and approximately $50,000 for general conditions and soft costs.  With approval from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the congregation can move forward with restoration work for the windows.

Muddy Waters house renovations get city funding,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved the Adopt-A-Landmark application for the Muddy Water House. Located at 4339 S Lake Park Avenue in North Kenwood, City Council approved its landmark status back in October 2021. Built in 1891, the brick two-flat sits on a traditional Chicago residential lot and is site midblock between E 43rd Street and E 44th Street. It was home to Muddy Waters between 1954 and 1973. Conditionally awarded the funding in December 2021, the money will go towards the renovation of the home into a museum dedicated to telling the story of Muddy Waters. Owned by Shandra Cooper, the project is expected to cost $267,000 for phase one of the project. The approved Adopt-A-Landmark grant will cover $250,000 of those costs.   With Bauer Latoza Studio as the architect, the house museum will need an extensive list of repairs and renovations before it can open to the public. Work will include repointing the face brick, cleaning paint, replacing the turret funnel, working on the bay window, adding a new entry door on the back of the house, repairing the main front door, and installing new storm doors that will be replicas of the ones that existed while Muddy Waters lived there. Work is expected to begin once funding is secured and finalized, with a projected starting time frame of Summer 2022. The owner is considering the purchase of the adjacent vacant lot to expand into the future phases of the museum. ",Kenwood
Work underway on 43rd Street pedestrian bridge ,"Construction is ramping up on a new pedestrian bridge crossing Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central rail tracks at 43rd Street. When complete in late 2022, it will provide a fully-accessible connection for South Side residents to get to and from the Chicago Lakefront Trail, Burnham Park, and nearby beaches. Preparation work has been underway on both sides of Lake Shore Drive since January, and an existing overpass will soon be demolished to make way for the curving, snake-like pathway. If the S-shaped design and arching blue supports in the renderings look familiar, it's because the city completed a similar bridge at nearby 41st street in late 2018. Local architect Cordogan Clark & Associates designed both projects in collaboration with engineering firm AECOM.  Like its sibling to the north, the upcoming 43rd Street connection will feature ADA-compliant ramps to serve pedestrians, cyclists, residents with disabilities, as well as emergency vehicles. According to the Chicago Department of Transportation, the 43rd Street playlot in Burnham Park will also be replaced with a new playground as part of the project's estimated $31.5 million price tag.

Caisson permit issued for Parcel O at Lakeshore East,"A caisson permit has been issued for Parcel O, a mixed-use tower in Lakeshore East. Addressed at 193 N. Columbus, the development is being led by Magellan Development Group and will occupy a vacant parcel within the Lakeshore East masterplan. Designed by bKL Architecture, the development underwent a redesign in 2021 which saw the scope of the building revised to contain only one hotel with 269 keys rather than two hotels with 570 keys. The developer had also reduced the number of apartment units from 640 to approximately 629 apartment units. The redesign also includes three levels of co-working space and two retail spaces in the building, including an approximately 5,500-square-foot retail space adjacent to Upper Columbus Drive and an approximately 3,500-square-foot retail space adjacent to North Park Drive. As a result of these revisions to the program of the building, there are also reductions in the building height and the overall square footage for the building. The revised height of the 47-story building will be 502 feet. Permit filings show a slightly revised scope, with the hotel key count down to 239 from 269 and the residential unit count down to 607 from 629. Residents will have access to 25 parking spaces on one of the lower floors, with hotel conference space and residential amenities also in the lower levels between N. Columbus Dr and N. Park Dr. The massing of the building has been designed with a sawtooth plan that creates dynamic movement along the façade and strong vertical lines that pull the eye up to the building’s crown. The facade’s articulation reverses direction between the residential and hotel floors, highlighting the change in program. The tower massing is pushed to the eastern side of the site, allowing for a base that is more in scale with the adjacent buildings on the park. The project originally received approval from the Chicago Plan Commission in 2018 and planned to begin construction back in 2021 after receiving site plan approval for the revised design. With the caisson permit issued, general contractor Power Construction can begin work on the new building. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Lakeshore East

On the 41st floor is a wine tasting room, separate show and prep kitchens with dining area and chef’s corner lounge, and outdoor terrace with grilling stations and a fire pit – all overlooking breathtaking views of Lake Michigan and the city skyline. Beyond the building, Cirrus also offers direct access to Cascade Park, the 0.8-acre green space created for both residents and the public. Designed by Claude Cormier + Associés, whose vision was executed by Confluence, the park features lush landscaping, passive wellness features, meandering pathways, outdoor living rooms for recreational use, terrace seating and a dog run. As part of the overall vision for the development, Cascade Park established a significantly improved connection between the Lakeshore East neighborhood and the lakefront with its terraced landscape design that slopes from North Harbor Drive to Lower Lake Shore Drive and a new bike and walking path that connects Lakeshore East Park in the heart of the neighborhood to the Lakefront Trail. Cirrus condominiums include 12 different one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans ranging in size from 650 to nearly 3,000 square feet and priced from the mid-$400,000s to $2.9 million. Floors 42-47 feature two-, three- and four-bedroom penthouse homes, including one duplex, ranging from 1,558 to 3,695 square feet and priced from $1.8 million to $5 million. Two townhome residences measuring more than 3,000 square feet are located at ground level and priced from $1.8 million. Views in each unit are enhanced by floor-to-ceiling windows and 9-foot ceilings, and all include laundry rooms, walk-in closets with custom organizer systems, wide-plank flooring and keyless entry. Many also have private balconies. Prospective buyers can view six models showcasing the high-end finishes all homes at Cirrus will feature. Kitchens include best-in-class Snaidero cabinetry, quartzite countertops and decorative tile backsplashes; Gaggenau wall ovens, speed ovens and gas cooktops; Bosch built-in recirculating hoods; Gaggenau integrated refrigerators; Bosch integrated dishwashers; Dornbracht faucets; and Franke stainless steel undermount sinks with disposal. Snaidero cabinetry, quartzite countertops, Dornbracht faucets, walk-in showers with frameless glass doors, frameless wall-mounted illuminated mirrors with medicine cabinets, and porcelain tile on floors and walls bring a spa-like quality to the primary and secondary baths. In accordance with Lendlease’s global commitment to sustainability, health and wellness, the development partners are on track to obtain LEED Gold and Fitwel certifications for both Cirrus and Cascade.

Photos: Cascade Park opens in Lakeshore East,"Work is complete on Cascade Park, a privately developed but publicly accessible open space improvement in downtown's Lakeshore East neighborhood. The new landscaping slopes downward nearly 50 feet from North Harbor Drive to the west to form a ground-level connection to Lower Lake Shore Drive and the Chicago Lakefront Trail to the east. Magellan Development and Lendlease broke ground on the 0.8-acre green space alongside a pair of adjacent residential towers in mid-2019. Montreal-based landscape architects Claude Cormier + Associes designed the park with a series of ADA-accessible sidewalk switchbacks that frame flattened lawns which can be used for recreational activities and social gatherings. There are also ""passive wellness sculptures,"" composed of limestone and wood blocks that double as seating.  Cascade Park sits atop a ramp-like reinforced concrete structure and geofoam blocks—a lightweight material used in other recent landscape projects in Chicago, including nearby Maggie Daley Park and Bennett Park. Beneath the elevated green space, improved bike and walking paths link Lakeshore East Park to the Lakefront Trail and DuSable Harbor. A dog-friendly area at the base of the slope—dubbed ""Cascade Bark""—is still receiving its finishing touches.  According to a statement from Lendlease, the project represents ""a significant aesthetic and functional improvement to the neighborhood's connection to the lakefront."" The new connection between Lakeshore East and the lakefront replaces what the developer described as a ""nondescript concrete maze of lower-level sidewalks and service drives."" The opening of Cascade Park also coincides with the first move-ins at the 37-story Cascade apartment tower at nearby 455 E. Waterside Drive. The building from Magellan, Lendlease, and bKL Architecture features 503 rental units and 45,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenity space. Monthly rents in the newly opened tower start at $1,650 per month for a studio, $2,050 for a one-bedroom, $3,300 for a two-bedroom, and $5,750 per month for a three-bedroom unit. Cascade's sibling, a 47-story condominium building, known as Cirrus, is on track to welcome residents to its 350 for-sale units this fall. Magellan and Lendlease also have city approval to build a third residential tower on Lakeshore East's vacant ""Parcel I"" to the immediate north. It's unclear when the team intends to break ground on the 85-story, 950-foot-tall skyscraper.   ",Lakeshore East
New renderings: Lakeshore East's Cascade apartments begin pre-leasing,"As construction crews put the finishing touches on the exterior of Cascade, the team behind the upcoming Lakeshore East apartment tower has released a fresh batch of renderings to lure potential tenants.  Lendlease and Magellan Development announced the start of pre-leasing this week and expect renters to begin moving into the 37-story high-rise at 455 E. Waterside Drive this summer. The building features 503 apartments spanning 509 to 1,332 square feet. Rents start at $1,650 per month for a studio, $2,050 for a one-bedroom, $3,300 for a two-bedroom, and $5,750 per month for a three-bedroom unit. Residents at Cascade will have access to 45,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenity space including a lake-facing fitness center, an outdoor pool, an indoor pool, a screening room, a golf simulator, a game room, a children’s playroom, and a dedicated ""jam room"" with communal musical instruments. A terrace of the tower's 32nd floor features views of Navy Pier and Lake Michigan plus a TV lounge with a chef's kitchen and a study corner with private work pods. Closer to the ground, residents can access an indoor garden dubbed ""the conservatory."" The 900-square-foot space includes seating overlooking Cascade Park: a sloping landscaped publicly accessible pedestrian connection that will bridge Harbor Drive, Lower Lake Shore Drive, and the Lakefront Trail. The new park is on track to also open this summer alongside the apartment building. Cascade's sibling tower, an adjacent 47-story, 350-unit condominium building known as Cirrus, will open a little later and welcome residents this fall. The projects' developers are offering a program that allows residents to sign a contract for a condo at Cirrus and rent next door at Cascade as they wait for their residence to be completed. Half of the rent paid (up to 2.5 percent of the purchase price) can be recouped as a credit at closing. ""The program has been very well-received by the market, as it gives renters the opportunity to build equity in their future home and, when they are ready, seamlessly transition to ownership without uprooting their lives,"" said Lendlease's Ted Weldon in a news release. Lendlease is currently offering a similar rent-to-own arrangement in its multi-building Southbank development along the south branch of the Chicago River. ",Lakeshore East
Exterior work nearly complete on Lakeshore East's Cirrus and Cascade towers,"In Lakeshore East, Magellan Development and Lendlease are putting the final touches on a pair of new residential high-rises known as Cirrus and Cascade.  The developers broke ground on the downtown towers in mid-2019 and worked through the pandemic to top off both structures in January of this year. Crews are currently wrapping up glass installation, interior build-out, and the project's publicly accessible green space known as ""Cascade Park."" Cirrus, the taller of the two towers, rises 47 stories at 211 N. Harbor Drive. It contains 350 condominiums offered in one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom floorplans ranging from 650 to over 3,000 square feet in size. Pricing starts in the mid-$400,000 range and can exceed $4 million for penthouse units. Cirrus will welcome residents this fall. The neighboring 37-story Cascade building at 455 E. Waterside Drive will contain 503 rental apartments in studio, one-, two, and three-bedroom layouts. Pre-leasing in the shorter tower is set to begin in the coming weeks with the first move-ins expected this summer. Both Cirrus and Cascade were designed by Lakeshore East-based bKL Architecture and feature glassy exteriors with vertical bronze and copper-colored metal accents. The towers sit atop a shared parking podium that is mostly concealed behind the elevated roadways of Lake Shore Drive and Harbor Drive.  Cascade Park is expected to open ahead of schedule this summer. Designed by Montreal landscape architects Claude Cormier + Associes, the 0.8-acre public amenity will provide a sloping pedestrian connection between Harbor Drive, Lower Lake Shore Drive, and the Lakefront Trail. Cirrus and Cascade are among the final buildings in the Lakeshore East masterplan. The duo will eventually be joined by a third bKL-designed residential skyscraper to the immediate north at ""Parcel I,"" although it's unclear when developers plan to break ground on the 85-story, 950-foot-tall tower. The final piece of the LSE puzzle is the ""Parcel O"" building slated for 193 N. Columbus Drive. Also developed by Magellan and designed by bKL, the roughly 500-foot high-rise will contain 629 residential units and 269 hotel rooms. The Parcel O project will break ground no sooner than October 2021, according to Ald. Brendan Reilly. ",Lakeshore East

Planned by Mangan Builders, the former Rexx Rugs buildings will be demolished to clear the way for the new construction. With a design from Johnathan Splitt Architects, the new construction will encompass a six-story mixed-use building. Rising 83 feet, the project will front N. Lincoln Ave with approximately 1,500 square feet of retail space while holding 24 units on the upper floors. Split into 4 studios, 19 two-beds, and one three-bedroom unit, approximate rents will start at $1,050/month for studios, $1,480/month for two-beds, and $1,920/month for the three-bedroom unit. Five of the apartments will be designated as affordable units. The building will provide 7 car parking spaces and 24 bike parking spaces in an enclosed garage on the back of the ground floor accessed from the alley. With approval from the ZBA, the project will get a variation to reduce the rear setback on floors containing dwelling units from 30 feet to 7.21 feet. With the rezoning approved in 2022 and the variation now approved from the ZBA, the developers can move forward with the approximately $7 million development. Permits for the project have been filed, but a timeline for construction is currently unclear. ",Lakeview
The Ludlow celebrates ribbon cutting in Lincoln Park,"Alderman Hopkins joined developer Heart of America Group to celebrate the ribbon cutting of The Ludlow, the residential conversion of the Ludlow Typograph Building at 2032 N. Clybourn.  The structure was designated as a Chicago landmark back in May 2022, with its exterior facade protected by the designation. Built and expanded over time, the original portion was constructed in 1913 with a design by Alfred S. Alschuler. Subsequent additions came in 1918, 1921, 1928, and 1948 as the company expanded. With GREC Architects designing the project, the converted building is now home to 121 loft apartments in addition to 20,000 square feet of commercial space. With a mix of studios, one-beds, two-beds, and three-beds, the units will feature high-end finishes, 12-foot ceilings, large windows, and select units will have access to private terraces.  Amenities include a rooftop lounge with an omakase’ lounge, a fitness center with infrared sauna & yoga studios offering weekly fitness & yoga classes, a demonstration kitchen, media room, coworking lounge, EV charging stations, bike storage and repair station, and concierge options. Move-ins have begun and though the leasing team has been accepting applications for just a couple of weeks, the building is on track to reach 25% lease-up soon.  ",Lincoln Park

Alderman Knudsen approves DePaul Basketball practice facility,"Alderman Timmy Knudsen has officially announced his approval of the DePaul Basketball practice facility. Planned for the northwest corner of W. Belden Ave and N. Sheffield Ave, the new facility will rise across the street from the current Sullivan Athletic Center. The site is home to four 1890s row houses as well as a 1925 courtyard building on the corner of W. Belden Ave and N. Sheffield Ave, all of which are owned by DePaul University. Designed by HNTB and Antunovich Associates, the new basketball facility will feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. The design has been tweaked with a refined brick facade design at the base of the building with large windows to make the activity in the building more visible from the street. The footprint of the building was also reduced so that the sidewalk could be widened for new landscaping and benches. Higher environmental standards and green amenities include bird-friendly glass and rooftop solar panels that will decrease energy use by more than 10%. Throughout the community engagement process, one of the main issues has been the planned demolition of the existing structures which include four 1890s rowhomes and a 1925 courtyard building. As a result of negotiations, DePaul will invest in the formal landmarking of the exteriors of Byrne Hall and Cortelyou Commons. Additionally, DePaul has also committed to preserving O’Connell Hall for future generations with an investment of several million dollars in maintaining its historic facade and other necessary upgrades. For the community, DePaul has reignited its ongoing commitment to engage with its neighbors. The Plan of Operation for the Proposed DePaul Facility includes a re-commitment by DePaul to community benefits they have provided for years, such as hosting public services like the post office and library, free neighborhood parking, discounted memberships to the Ray Meyer fitness center, and direct financial support to local nonprofits. In addition, this proposal outlines new community benefits such as expanded use of DePaul-owned facilities for youth sports leagues and community stakeholders and additional direct financial support to local nonprofits.  Expanding their commitment to community organizations, DePaul has agreed to provide use of McGrath-Phillips Arena or Wish Field for an annual event to each of seven Community Stakeholders. In addition to their investment in making an environmentally sound building, I am proud to share that DePaul has agreed to my office’s request that they install a significant number of electric vehicle charging stations on campus. These stations will be accessible to the public and operated by a vendor selected by the university. With approval from Alderman Timmy Knudsen secured, the $60 million project can seek city approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. If approved, the demolition of buildings on site would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest. Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026.  ",Lincoln Park

Wax Trax building gets preliminary landmark designation,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for Wax Trax! Located at 2449 N. Lincoln, life and business partners Jim Nash and Dannie Flesher opened the WAX TRAX! records store in 1978. Their shared passion for music inspired the retail venture and their personal tastes, creative generosity, and willingness to take risks shaped the store into an international source of eclectic and ground-breaking music. Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, WAX TRAX! invigorated Chicago’s music scene. With bootlegs, imports, and hard-to-find records, cassettes, CDs, and videos, WAX TRAX! became an international retail destination. WAX TRAX! helped to shape the world’s perceptions of Chicago music. As the home base of the WAX TRAX! record label, the store at 2449 North Lincoln helped to launch industrial-dance music, what became to be known as industrial music, in the United States.  WAX TRAX! opened at a time when society’s pendulum was swinging away from earlier decades’ idealism and freedom-focused liberation toward the New Right and nostalgic conservatism of the Reagan years. The store provided a rare refuge to outsiders and outcasts as a mecca and a meeting place for those most comfortable outside the mainstream. The arrival of WAX TRAX! in Chicago was monumental in terms of shaping Chicago’s music scene. WAX TRAX! was a favorite of director John Hughes in whose film's music played a key role. The building also meets Criterion 4 as an example of exemplary architecture. WAX TRAX! is a neighborhood store and flat building with an unusually high degree of ornamentation. It is a rare, early example of the use of glazed-brick cladding applied to a small-scale building. The building maintains an original Renaissance Revival cornice with a “broken pediment,” swags between curved brackets, a highly detailed central panel, and four acroterion and an obelisk projecting above the cornice’s horizontal elements. Carved Bedford limestone elements on the building’s façade include prominent window hoods and sills, and a first-floor cornice with mascarons (human faces) which are rarely found on a store and flat building.  The structure was built circa 1880s and re-fronted circa 1900 in white- and green-glazed brick. In the decades leading up to World War I, white-glazed brick and terra cotta took precedence over darker tones as the preferred cladding for dozens of skyscrapers built in the Chicago Loop.  Meeting the Integrity Criterion, WAX TRAX! possesses sufficient integrity to convey its historic architectural and cultural significance. The building remains in its original location within a low-scale but dense commercial setting. Additions to the structure have been at the rear and are not visible so have not negatively impacted the structure’s integrity. The original storefront and windows have been replaced, but this is typical for commercial structures of this age and can be reversed. The building largely retains its character-defining features, materials, and overall design and therefore sufficiently conveys its historic significance. Significant features of the building would be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building. With this preliminary recommendation approved, Landmarks staff will draft a detailed report before getting the Commission’s final recommendation. Once that is approved the proposed designation will head to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council.  ",Lincoln Park
City Council approves 2033 N. Kingsbury,"The Chicago City Council has approved Sterling Bay’s proposed mixed-use development at 2033 N. Kingsbury. Originally announced in September 2022, the project site is directly across the street from Lincoln Yards North. With a combination of low-rise retail buildings and parking lots surrounding the site, the tower will be a middle ground between the new high-density towers of Lincoln Yards and the low-rise neighbors along N. Clybourn Ave. Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the 25-story tower will hold 355 residential units. The project’s unit mix will include 49 studios, 40 convertibles, 186 one-beds, 70 two-beds, and 10 three-beds. To meet ARO requirements, 71 of the apartments will be set aside at a weighted average of 60% AMI. On the ground floor, the building has been setback with the residential entry at the middle of the project’s street frontage. 7,500 square feet of ground floor retail space will overlook the outdoor space at the south end of the site which will also include a dog run for residents. A private drive along the north end of the site will give residents access to 203 car parking spaces as well as a bike room with 360 bike parking spaces. The building’s design looks to minimize its impact on the site and the taller massing opens view corridors from Lincoln Yards towards the neighborhood to the east and avoids creating a long bar building where the original design created a wall within the neighborhood. The massing was further broken down by shifting the volume and using a facade design that incorporates a combination of brick, steel, and glass to articulate the building. With approval from City Council secured, the site will be rezoned from M2-2 to B3-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. Once financing is secured, the project is expected to follow a 24-month construction timeline. ",Lincoln Park

Plan Commission approves two-tower development at 1840 N. Marcey,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved Sterling Bay’s proposed two-tower development at 1840 N. Marcey. Located near Lincoln Yards, the project site is across the street from the former General Iron site. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the property is a long, rectangular site bound by N. Clifton Ave to the north, N. Kingsbury St to the west, N. Marcey St to the east, and W. Wisconsin St to the south.   Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the project’s design inspiration is based on the industrial history of the area, the Chicago city grid, and the Chicago River. The building massings began with a contextual base surrounded by open space, with stepped building masses that were extruded from the bases. The towers were offset to optimize sunlight for active terraces and to create better views for each building. As a result of community feedback, the south building’s height was reduced by 20 feet from 215 down to 195 feet. The north building was cut by 50 feet from 325 feet down to 275 feet. As part of the plan, the 615 units will be retained, while the parking count has been reduced from 360 spaces down to 275 spaces. The retail space is now 9,600 square feet down from the originally planned 17,600 square feet.  With parking underground in the south building, apartments will start on the second floor, giving a residential character and providing more eyes on the streets. The north building will have two podium levels of parking topped by an amenity deck. The towers will rise with apartment floors and the south building will be topped by a rooftop deck looking downtown and towards the river.  The 615 apartments will include 20% affordability, with 124 ARO units in the building at a weighted average of 60% AMI. Overall, the buildings will have 107 studios, 374 one-beds, 107 two-beds, and 27 three-beds. Of those, 21 studios, 76 one-beds, 21 two-beds, and 6 three-beds will be affordable.  The project’s site includes green space along N. Marcey St with an internal drive separating the two buildings.

Clybourn Place could get 520-foot-tall tower as part of redevelopment,"CRM Properties, the owner of Clybourn Place at 1800 N. Clybourn, is looking to overhaul the mostly vacant shopping center with plans that could include a 500-unit residential tower alongside a series of new retail buildings. Located in Lincoln Park, the property runs along N. Clybourn Ave and N. Sheffield Ave bisected by W. Willow St and bound by N. Marcey St to the west.  Dubbed the Willow Street District, the new plan designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative would see the new construction of 70,875 square feet of retail space supported by 447 enclosed and surface parking spaces as well as pedestrian walkways through the property.  Most of the existing buildings on the site would be demolished under the plan, aside from preserving part of the former Bed Bath & Beyond structure and two decorative masonry towers remaining from a William D. Gibson Co. Spring plant — and later a Turtle Wax plant — that was built on the site in 1908. The new retail building along Clybourn and Sheffield would get a third tower to mimic the historic two in the other buildings. A proposed residential tower would be sited on the southwest side of the site along N. Marcey St, replacing a vacant, single-story retail structure and surface parking. The approximately 520-foot-tall tower would have 500 luxury rental units with additional parking for residents.  The developer plans to build out the new retail space first before approaching developing the tower. According to CoStar, a representative from the developer stated that retail construction would be done by early 2026 after which they would go back to the city to get final approvals for the residential tower.

Demo permit issued to make way for 4640 N. Western,"A demolition permit has been issued to clear an existing three-story building at 4634 N. Western, clearing the way for Macon Construction’s development at 4640 N. Western. Currently occupied by three existing buildings, the site spans from the CTA Western Brown Line tracks down to W. Eastwood Ave. The four-story building will be retained and incorporated into the new construction, while the other two buildings will be demolished. Designed by Hirsch MPG, the mixed-use building will stand six stories tall, topping out at 91 feet tall. With 74 units in the building, the unit mix will include 8 studios, 28 one-beds, and 38 two-beds. The development will meet the ARO by providing 15 of the apartments as affordable, including 2 of the studios, 6 of the one-beds, and 7 of the two-beds. As part of the plans, residents would have access to a shared rooftop deck and dog run. On the ground floor, two live/work units will face N. Western just south of the CTA L tracks, with a two-bedroom unit behind it facing the space underneath the L tracks. The retail space will measure 3,900 square feet and another live/work unit will face W. Eastwood Ave. The residential lobby will front W. Eastwood Ave and parking for 10 cars will be provided along the alley. 74 bike parking spaces will be available, and the developer added a bike maintenance space upon request of the community. The design of the overall building has a consistent stone base that wraps the ground floor before switching to a brick facade up above. The massing has multiple insets along the face of the building to break up the scale and the corner space on the sixth floor was removed to bring down the scale of the corner. The building is further refined with larger windows, a two-tone brick treatment, and masonry stone detailing. In terms of sustainability, the development will meet the new energy code, provide EV charging, utilize a high-efficiency MEP system, and provide electric appliances in all of the units.  With the demolition permit issued for the three-story structure on the corner of the site, demolition contractor Precision Excavation can clear the site to allow for new construction to begin.

CTA plans rehabilitation of the Western Brown Line Station,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has detailed its plans to modernize the Western Brown Line station and bus turnaround, bringing the station back to a state of good repair for the Lincoln Square community. Established as part of the original construction of the Ravenswood branch in the early-1900s, the current Western Brown Line station was rebuilt in 1920 and underwent a major renovation in 1979-1981 to be made fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Since this station was already fully accessible to those who use mobility devices, this was the only Brown Line station to receive modest upgrades and repairs under the Brown Line Capacity Expansion project (2004-2009). “This project represents a $19 million investment in the Lincoln Square community that relies on our bus and Brown Line services to make vital connections to the rest of the city,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “As we continue the work of increasing ridership systemwide, our goal is to make capital improvements that will be appreciated by current bus and rail customers and encourage new riders to utilize the system.” As part of the rehabilitation, new ADA doors will be added to the main entrance on Western Avenue.  Beginning this summer, crews will begin work on track structure painting, platform rehabilitation, and roof replacement. The station will also feature a new bus boarding island and canopy structure for customers to use while waiting for one of the several routes that connect through the station. Sidewalks will be replaced in front of the station and lighting will also be upgraded along the walkway between the station and Lincoln Avenue.  Upon completion of the project, riders will have smoother access to the station thanks to the replaced sidewalks. The rehabilitated station interior will also feature new accent lighting that highlights a segment of the Berlin Wall on display. The CTA will also be refinishing the floors and interior walls as well as replacing the elevator cabs, stair treads and risers as well as constructing a new customer service assistance kiosk. On the platform level, the concrete platform edge will be replaced. Repairs will also be made to the existing concrete platform, handrail, and platform canopy. To perform this work, occasional weekend day line cuts between Kimball and Western will be required. There will also be temporary bus stop relocation while the bus turnaround is being rehabbed. Details of any service impacts will be shared with customers once details are finalized. Work is anticipated to start this summer and continue through late 2025. ",Lincoln Square

4715 N. Western scores full building permit,"**UPDATED RENDERINGS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY DESIGNBRIDGE** A full building permit has been issued for 4715 N. Western. Located at the intersection of W. Leland Ave and N. Western Ave, the site is currently a city-owned public parking lot on the northeastern corner of the intersection. The Community Builders is the developer behind the concept, with The Boar Company as a new co-developer. Originally proposed back in 2019, the project was awarded LIHTC financing in late 2021. The development scheme at that time called for a five-story building that would hold 5,000 square feet of retail space, 51 affordable apartments, 41 public parking spaces, and 9 private parking spaces for residents. During the city’s further review after conditionally awarding the LIHTC financing, the development was thrown into question after the city demanded less parking in the building and that the parking access be moved from N. Western Ave to the alley. With DesignBridge on tap as the architect, the compromise resulted in a six-story building that will deliver a total of 63 new affordable homes, 4,995 square feet of ground floor commercial space, expanded outdoor public space, and a second-floor parking deck that will include 36 parking spaces. Down from an original 50 spaces, the 36 will be split into 18 for the public and 18 for private residents. The building will be topped by a green roof and rooftop deck for residents. The parking entrance will be retained along N. Western Ave based on feedback from local business owners and residents that a potential entrance in the alley would pose multiple logistical and safety issues.  To fund the project, the City Council sold six city-owned parcels, appraised at a value of $4.925 million, to the developers at a total of $6, charging $1 per parcel. Further financing includes up to $12 million in TIF funding, $12 million in city multi-family program funds, $15.9 in lender financing, $14.5 million in LIHTC funding, $2.1 million in donation tax credits, $140,000 from a ComEd grant, and $2 million from a new hope construction bridge loan.   With the full building permit issued, general contractor Leopardo Companies can begin construction.

Sterling Bay plans two mixed-use towers at 1840 N. Marcey,"Sterling Bay has submitted a rezoning proposal for two mixed-use towers at 1840 N. Marcey. Located near Lincoln Yards, the project site is across the street from the former General Iron site. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the property is a long, rectangular site bound by N. Clifton Ave to the north, N. Kingsbury St to the west, N. Marcey St to the east, and W. Wisconsin St to the south.   With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board for the design, the project will redevelop the site with two new towers. Designed as a pair, both buildings will have low-rise parking podiums clad in a mixture of brick and glass topped by amenity decks. Setting back from the podiums, the residential towers will also utilize similar facade strategies. The east and west elevations will be expressed as more opaque with a combination of architectural-grade aluminum and glass in a window wall system. The north and south elevations will be almost entirely clad in glass with an aluminum and glass window wall system.   The northern building, located within Subarea A, will be the larger tower, rising 27 floors. Standing 321 feet tall, the building will have ground floor retail space and 315 residential units. 262 car parking spaces and 315 bike parking spaces will be included in the building.  On the ground floor, the retail space will front N. Kingsbury St and N. Clifton Ave, with the residential lobby facing south onto an internal motor court that separates the two buildings. Parking access will be from N. Kingsbury St and loading access will be from N. Marcey St. The southern tower, located within Subarea B, will be slightly smaller, standing 16 stories tall. Rising 214 feet tall, this second building will have 294 residential units and more ground floor retail space. Just 98 parking spaces and 294 bike parking spaces will be provided within the building. The site plan shows this lower tower having a curving form in plan, with the retail space at the south end along N. Marcey St as well as some at the north end along N. Kingsbury St and facing internally towards the motor court. The residential lobby will face east onto an open landscaped plaza that is located along N. Marcey St. Loading access will be from N. Kingsbury St and parking access will be from the north end of the building via the internal motor court. To meet the ARO obligation of 20%, Sterling Bay is planning to provide 92 affordable units within the buildings and pay a fee in-lieu of $4.5 million to cover the remaining 30 units.  The newly proposed development will need a rezoning from M2-3 to B3-3 with an overall Planned Development designation to allow for the new construction. Sterling Bay is also expected to take a 3.5 FAR bonus by paying into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. Approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council will be required for the development to move forward. ",Lincoln Yards

Concord Pl. The eastern side of this parcel, known as C.1, will deliver two entertainment venues, including one holding 1,000 seats and one holding 3,500 seats.  Just to the north of 1665 N. Throop, 1687 N. Throop will be a 19-story, 223-foot-tall mixed-use building. Meeting the ground with two floors of commercial and retail space, the remainder of the tower will hold 350 residential units. The unit mix will consist of 102 studios, 171 one-beds, 73 two-beds, and 4 three-beds. Of those units 35 will be affordable, with 10 studios, 17 one-beds, and 8 two-beds.  Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the building is made up of two wings facing the park, with a bridge element between them. Terraces step back as the building rises, with balconies integrated into the facade. The building will have 150 parking spaces located underneath the park’s athletic fields and 75 bike parking spaces. The Market Hall will be located to the east of the new tower. Designed for food and beverage tenants, the one-story building will be a key node and front both the park and interior promenade.  Occupying the rest of the space north of the new buildings and east of N. Throop St, Parcel B.1 will contain a newly constructed park, riverwalk and seawall. Designed by Site Design Group, the park will feature active recreational uses including a dog run, recreation fields and courts, and a children’s playground. An overlook with a seating area is placed at the northern end of the park facing the river. A couple of small buildings will provide public restrooms as well as space for canoe and kayak rental. A canoe and kayak launch will be located along the eastern edge of the park along the riverwalk. The new riverwalk will engage with a naturalized river edge and connect to the new section in front of 1229 W. Concord Pl.  With site plan approval already obtained for these buildings, Sterling Bay plans to break ground on 1665 N. Throop and 1687 N. Throop by the end of the year. The developer plans to phase the construction of the park, starting with the southern portion near the new buildings to accelerate the delivery of green space for the development. Foundation permits are currently pending for both of the towers. Once construction begins, each tower will take approximately two years to build. ",Lincoln Yards
Urbanize tours progress at 1229 W. Concord,"Urbanize recently toured the ongoing construction at 1229 W. Concord. Planned by Sterling Bay as its first building at Lincoln Yards, the new life sciences building will deliver 280,000 rentable square feet. Rising 144 feet, the nine-story development was designed by Gensler, featuring a glass and aluminum facade enclosing the building. 45 parking spaces will be provided in the basement. Coming from the Lincoln Yards Experience Center, we entered the site where the new extension of W. Concord Pl meets N. Throop St. Work on the road itself is wrapping up and utilities are beginning to be connected to the building. Entering at the west end of the ground floor, we walked through the fitness and wellness center before passing into the double-height lobby. Fronting W. Concord Pl, the lobby will include a reception desk with turnstiles for accessing the elevators. At the eastern end of the ground floor, a monumental spiral staircase will float within the lobby space, with a pre-function space behind it for the conference center that occupies the eastern end of the second floor.  Overlooking the river, a new portion of riverwalk is currently under construction in front of the building. The section will be connected to W. Concord Place for bicycle and pedestrian access, with stepped terraces used to create different spaces within the setback riverwalk area. Seating elements and landscaped areas will round out the exterior space’s design.  Heading up the building, our next stop on the tour was the eighth floor, which is the highest rentable office floor. With the building hosting 280,000 square feet of rentable space, the life sciences distinction means that each floor plate is split into 50% wet lab space and 50% office space. With typical office floors occupying the third through eighth levels, wet lab space will utilize the southern half of the floor plate, while the office space will occupy the northern half of the floor plate. Every floor will have a private balcony for the office tenants that faces southeast, overlooking the river and views of downtown.  Our last stop was the ninth floor which is exclusively occupied by massive mechanical units and machinery. As a life sciences building, the mechanical and ventilation needs are much higher than a typical office building, requiring this entire mechanical floor. As pictured, an enormous DOAS, or Dedicated Outdoor Air System, sits on the roof with a huge chiller to service the building with fresh air and ventilation.  With work progressing rapidly, general contractor Power Construction expects to reach substantial completion by April 2023. Tenant build outs could begin as soon as the end of this year in line with leasing activity. As Sterling Bay looks to begin the next phase of Lincoln Yards, horizontal infrastructure will be built out for N. Throop St and The Steelyard will be the next phase of work alongside the new park. Permits have been filed for the 15-story office building at 1665 N. Throop and the 19-story residential building at 1687 N. Throop, which will overlook the park to the north. Details on the Steelyard can be found here. ",Lincoln Yards
ALLY at 1229 W. Concord tops out,"Sterling Bay and Harrison Street recently celebrated the structural completion of ALLY at 1229 W. Concord Pl, a new life sciences facility that will provide the city’s rapidly growing biotech community with much needed lab space along the North Branch of the Chicago River. The topping out event was attended by Sterling Bay and Harrison Street’s project leadership teams, as well as partners at Power Construction and Gensler, who marked the milestone with a traditional beam-signing ceremony.  1229 W. Concord Pl. is a 320,000-square-foot Class A development that will house industry-leading companies seeking to conduct groundbreaking life sciences research in Chicago. Designed by Gensler, the building features ultramodern amenities and expansive outdoor gathering spaces. Conveniently situated within walking distance of The Steelyard, Lincoln Yards’ future lifestyle district, tenants of 1229 W.

Concord is light, bright, and wellness driven. With balconies on every floor, natural materials incorporated throughout, and a seamless integration with the Chicago River, the project brings in the best of the outdoors and prioritizes tenant health through its pursual of LEED Silver Certification, WELL Health-Safety Certification, and RESET Air Standard.  1229 W. Concord Pl is expected to deliver to tenants in Q4 2022.  ",Lincoln Yards
Sterling Bay details Lincoln Yards South plan,"Sterling Bay has detailed its plans for Lincoln Yards South, presenting an informational presentation to the Chicago Plan Commission. Located at the southern end of the larger Lincoln Yards site, Lincoln Yards South will develop the land south of the Chicago River, bound by W. Concord Pl and N. Throop St. The plan is made up of three parcels, dubbed B.1, C.1, and D.1. Located along the river, Parcel B.1 will contain a newly constructed park, riverwalk and seawall. Designed by Site Design Group, the park will feature active recreational uses including a dog run, recreation fields and courts, and a children’s playground. An overlook with a seating area is placed at the northern end of the park facing the river. A couple of small buildings will provide public restrooms as well as space for canoe and kayak rental. A canoe and kayak launch will be located along the eastern edge of the park along the riverwalk. The new riverwalk will engage with a naturalized river edge and connect to the new riverwalk section in front of ALLY at 1229 W. Concord Pl.  At Parcel D.1, Sterling Bay is planning a 19-story, 223-foot-tall mixed-use building.  Meeting the ground with two floors of commercial and retail space, the remainder of the tower will hold 350 residential units. The unit mix will consist of 102 studios, 171 one-beds, 73 two-beds, and 4 three-beds. Of those units 35 will be affordable, with 10 studios, 17 one-beds, and 8 two-beds.  Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the building is made up of two wings facing the park, with a bridge element between them. Terraces step back as the building rises, with balconies integrated into the facade. The building will have a150 parking spaces located underneath the park’s athletic fields and 75 bike parking spaces.  The Market Hall will be located to the east of the new tower. Designed for food and beverage tenants, the one-story building will be a key node and front both the park and interior promenade.  Designed by Hoerr Schaudt Landscape Architects, the promenade is a public pedestrian space between the Parcel D.1 and C.1 buildings. Running east/west it will stitch the two buildings together, incorporating site furnishings, landscaping beds, and seating. Vehicular drop off will extend up from W. Concord Pl.  The final site, Parcel C.1 will hold a 15-story office building. Rising 218 feet, the structure will front the promenade and N. Throop St with retail space and an office lobby. Designed by Gensler, the structure will exhibit a concrete diagrid encased in a glass curtain wall. 140 car parking spaces and 70 bike parking spaces will be incorporated, accessed from W. Concord Pl. The eastern side of the parcel will deliver two entertainment venues, including one holding 1,000 seats and one holding 3,500 seats.  As part of the already approved Planned Development, the buildings will only require internal site plan review from DPD. Sterling Bay will break ground on Parcels C.1 and D.1 as well as the first phase of the park in Q2 of this year. This work is expected to be completed in Q3 of 2024. ",Lincoln Yards
Sterling Bay reveals plans for Lincoln Yards South,"Sterling Bay will present plans to the public for the next phase of Lincoln Yards, dubbed Lincoln Yards South, on Tuesday 12/13 at their Lincoln Yards Experience Center. Plans for this phase were revealed via a presentation listed on the city’s Department of Planning and Development website ahead of the public open house. The documents show that this portion of the masterplan is a collaboration between firms Gensler, Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, Site Design Group, and Hoerr Schaudt Landscape Architects. This section, dubbed The Steelyard, is comprised of multiple subareas including plots B.1, C.1, D.1, D.2, and D.3. ALLY is located on Parcel G.1, south of the to-be extended W Concord Place. C.1 will be directly north of W Concord Place across from ALLY, with Parcel D.1 north of C.1. The Steelyard Main Street will separate the two, turning the corner down to W Concord Place before it gets to the river. An unrevealed Parcel D.2 and D.3 will front the river, sitting to the east of Parcels C.1 and D.1. A large park, bound by N Throop Street, Parcel D.1, and the river, will be built over two phases, rounding out Lincoln Yards South.  The park space at B.1 will provide new residents with 6.5 acres of newly-created green space in the North Branch Corridor, per DPD’s website. Sterling Bay will be operating the park similar to the Chicago Park District, offering on site fields and spaces for organized league play, public free play, and special events. The park will boast four turf fields, a hard spot court, a playground, a dog run, and seating and flex space overlooking the river. The park will meet the water with a new riverwalk that includes a canoe/kayak launch and water taxi stop.  Parcel C.1 will be home to 1685 Throop, a mid-rise mixed-use building. Measuring 365,000 square feet, the building will offer 28,000-35,000 square foot office floor plates, 24,400 square feet of tenant amenity space, and up to 25,000 square feet of retail space. Located along the mixed-use lifestyle district, the building will include a venue and entertainment space. While no official height has been announced, zoning documents show a recent minor change request allowed for the height to be increased from an original 150 feet to 225 feet. The next plot in The Steelyard is Parcel D.1. Yet to be named, this next building will hold 355,000 square feet of residential space, retail space, and residential amenities, while overlooking the newly-planned park. A fully-glass facade will ensure unobstructed views, with exterior terraces lining the building's exterior. Like 1685 N Throop, this building was also subject to the minor change request for height, so this tower may rise up to 225 feet. 1685 N Throop and Parcel D.1 face onto what has been named “The Steelyard Main Street”, a pedestrian corridor and lifestyle and entertainment district. Retail and venue spaces will be accessible from this passageway that separates the buildings. A vehicular drop-off will extend north into the promenade from W Concord Place, between Parcel C.1 and the future D.2 and D.3.  According to a phasing plan provided by Sterling Bay, the currently under-construction ALLY at 1229 W Concord Place should be complete by 2022/2023 along with W Concord Place infrastructure improvements. 2024 will deliver 1685 N Throop, Parcel D.1, The Steelyard Main Street, marketplace retail, roads and utilities for The Steelyards, the first phase of the park at B.1, and finally a parking pedestal at Parcel E.1 and E.2, located on the west side of Throop Street.  The final deliveries of The Steelyards will come in 2025 with the completion of the unrevealed D.2 and D.3 residential buildings, the second phase of the park at B.1, the completed riverwalk and water taxi stop, completion of the Throop Street bridge and infrastructure, as well as the extension of the 606.  Sterling Bay’s public open house is a part of their master plan process, with the city requiring the collection of public feedback. A courtesy presentation to the Chicago Plan Commission is also required, however the commission will not vote as the master plan is already approved.  ",Lincoln Yards
ALLY at 1229 W. Concord lands full building permit,"ALLY at 1229 W. Concord Place, the first building of the Lincoln Yards megadevelopment, has received a full building permit for construction. Developed by Sterling Bay, the new building has already commenced construction with work beginning on the foundation. The tower crane was also recently erected.  Designed by Gensler, the development will produce a nine-story office building that will host approximately 280,000 square feet of Class A medical research lab space paired with office space. Tenants will enter the building off a newly extended W. Concord Place through a double-height lobby. The building will offer amenities including an event space, a conference center, a fitness and wellness center, and a tenant lounge. 55 parking spaces for tenants will be located underground.  The building’s design consists of a facade that features a combination of floor-to-ceiling windows and aluminium trim. Its massing is split into two bars that are offset to extend views to the river and downtown. The typical floor plate maximizes flexibility for tenants, while a staircase on the western façade allows for ease of travel between floors. Each level has an exterior terrace along the eastern façade facing the river.  The 144-foot-tall structure will front the river with a new section of riverwalk, the first of Lincoln Yards’s planned riverwalk. The section will be connected to W. Concord Place for bicycle and pedestrian access, with stepped terraces used to create different spaces within the setback riverwalk area. Seating elements and landscaped areas will round out the exterior space’s design.  Power Construction is the general contractor for construction, with a current timeline expecting completion in 2023.

First building at Lincoln Yards lands construction financing,"Construction is imminent on the first new building of the massive 55-acre Lincoln Yards megaproject along the north branch of the Chicago River. Dubbed ""ALLY at 1229 W. Concord Place,"" the eight-story building will provide 280,000 square feet of Class A medical research labs, creative office space, tenant amenities, and underground parking for 55 cars. Lincoln Yards developer Sterling Bay with partners Harrison Street and J.P. Morgan Asset Management announced on Thursday that it had closed on a $125 million construction loan for the project from Bank OZK. Pre-development construction work at the riverfront parcel is underway, and an official groundbreaking ceremony for the Gensler-designed building will take place sometime in October, according to Sterling Bay. The city has already issued both foundation and tower crane permits for the site at 1229 W. Concord. Phase one of Lincoln Yards also includes an extension of the Concord Place roadway and an improved river wall and landscaped riverwalk along the north branch. The upcoming building is expected to take approximately 24 months to complete, and Power Construction will serve as general contractor.  ""Chicago is an emerging market for biotechnology, supported by world-class academic institutions and a reputation for advanced medical research, but the city's current inventory of superior lab space prevents the industry from reaching its highest potential here,"" said Andy Gloor, CEO of Sterling Bay, in a statement. ""ALLY at 1229 W. Concord Place—and the forthcoming innovation district at Lincoln Yards—will meet the needs of today's most exciting and rapidly expanding life sciences companies, create a new home for scientific research in Chicago, and help the city continue to build its reputation as a major player in this critically important sector,"" Gloor added. The phase-one building is located at the southeastern-most parcel of the estimated $6 billion Lincoln Yards project. Spanning both sides of the river, the phased plan will eventually include multiple mixed-use high-rises totaling more than 14 million square feet as well as new bridges, roads, and 21 acres of open space. When complete, Lincoln Yards will support more than 23,000 on-site jobs, according to Sterling Bay. Earlier this year, the developer finished a $9 million, three-year-plus environmental remediation of the entire site, which was previously home to heavy industry. The process involved removing underground storage tanks, timber foundations, and old sub-basements as well as treating the soil for harmful contaminants such as petroleum compounds, hazardous PCBs, chlorinated solvents, and lead. ",Lincoln Yards
Sterling Bay completes environmental remediation at Lincoln Yards site,"Sterling Bay, the developer behind the massive multiphase Lincoln Yards project, has completed a years-long clean-up of 55 acres of polluted brownfield land along the Chicago River between Lincoln Park and Bucktown. ""For the last four years, we've been working with expert geologists and environmental engineers to reverse over a century's worth of industrial damage in the North Branch Corridor,"" said Sterling Bay CEO Andy Gloor on Thursday. ""The land we started with at Lincoln Yards was heavily polluted and unsuitable for community use, but today, Chicago residents are one major step closer to enjoying what will soon become a thriving new neighborhood that prioritizes the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors,"" Gloor announced. Environmental remediation at the future Lincoln Yards site has been underway since 2017. In 2019, Sterling Bay and contractors V3 Companies, RW Collins, TRS Group, and Heneghan Wrecking completed clean-up work on the north portion of the property, which was previously home to heavy industries such as the A. Finkl and Sons steel mill. ""The south portion had a similar history,"" explained Keith Oswald, director of environment and geosciences at V3 Companies. ""It used to be Illinois Steel North Works from the 1850s up until the 1970s. The site was then used by Proctor & Gamble for a while and then the City of Chicago for its fleet maintenance facility."" While working at Lincoln Yards South, crews discovered a series of old brick tunnels containing oily sediment, as well as timber foundations, storage tanks, and sub-basements that had to be removed. ""We conduct investigations before digging, but you don't really know what's there until you open up the can,"" said Oswald. ""Expecting the unexpected is part of the process, but it's still a surprise what you run into.""  In addition to demolishing and removing old underground structures, the soil itself—nearly 28,000 tons worth—had to be treated for harmful contaminants such as petroleum compounds, hazardous PCBs, chlorinated solvents, and lead.  ""Our remediation strategy was driven by the need to ensure there would be no adverse impact on the Chicago River,"" Sterling Bay project manager Jack Kim told Urbanize.  ""Impacted soils were excavated and disposed of at a licensed disposal facility,"" explained Kim. ""In some cases, the contaminated soils required pre-treatment with various chemical reagents to render the material non-hazardous before it was allowed to leave the site.""  To remove harmful chlorinated solvents, the team used a method known as electrical resistance heating. A series of electrical poles were placed in the ground and the contaminants were slowly ""cooked"" out of the soil over six months, collected as a vapor, and removed. The clean-up work at Lincoln Yards cost roughly $9 million. Although Sterling Bay has a Tax Increment Financing deal with the city to be reimbursed for infrastructure improvements such as new roads and bridges, environmental work is not TIF eligible and must be paid for by the developer.  ""Sterling Bay's environmental remediation efforts at Lincoln Yards represent huge progress in addressing community health issues caused by the site's industrial past, and I'm very pleased that their team continues to make good on its commitment to creating a cleaner, safer environment in the North Branch Corridor,"" said Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd), in a statement. With the environmental work now complete on both the north and south portions of the site, Sterling Bay is ready to turn its attention toward vertical construction at Lincoln Yards. The megaproject's first phase calls for a new life sciences building located at the southern portion of the site, along Concord Place. Sterling Bay will break ground on the Gensler-designed building in July and expect construction to take approximately 24 months to complete. The phase one structure will be joined by an extension of Concord Place as well as corresponding river wall improvements made along the edge of the new building, according to the developer. The full Lincoln Yards development will be built in phases and will eventually include multiple mixed-use high-rises spanning more than 14 million square feet. The plan calls for roughly 21 acres of open space as well as a public riverwalk.  Sterling Bay plans to pursue LEED certification for each of its individual buildings as well as for the entire Lincoln Yards development.

Rush seeks zoning for five-story inpatient facility ,"As Rush University Medical Center puts the finishing touches on its upcoming Joan and Paul Rubschlager Building, the Near West Side hospital is seeking city approval to construct a five-story inpatient facility at the northwest corner of Harrison and Loomis streets. Known as Rush Speciality Hospital, the proposed free-standing structure would span roughly 135,000 square feet. It would contain 100 beds (56 for comprehensive rehabilitation and 44 for long-term acute care), therapy equipment, and dining/sitting areas for patients, staff, and visitors. The estimated $109.5 million project is a joint venture between Rush and Select Medical Corporation and is expected to create between 800 and 1000 temporary construction jobs and at least 300 permanent positions. Designed by HDR Inc. in collaboration with GWG3 Architecture, the plan calls for an outdoor therapy area plus a 70-car parking lot and new landscaping located just west of the building. The project is slated for a 2.9-acre vacant parcel previously occupied by student housing. Before work can begin on the Rush Speciality Hospital, the Chicago Plan Commission and City Council will need to approve an amendment to the site's existing Institutional Planned Development.

Known as The Rosie, the newly finished building offers apartments ranging from micro-studios with monthly rents starting at $1,645 to larger two-bed units topping out at roughly $2,700 per month. Select studios feature high-tech ""smart"" furniture from Ori Design that maximizes space with beds that slide out of the way when not being used.   Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, The Rosie features a brick base topped by metal and glass residential floors. An L-shaped layout takes advantage of its triangular lot to optimize outdoor space and views. There are two ground-floor retail spaces totaling nearly 7,000 square feet and outdoor murals lining 15th Street.  Building amenities include a resident lounge, a fitness center, a dog run, and an 8,500-square-foot pool deck facing the Chicago skyline. Parking is spread across a 110-car garage and a 21-vehicle surface parking lot. In early 2020, the estimated $65 million development (then known by the name ""Pilsen Gateway"") scored tax incentives for being located in a federal Opportunity Zone, reported Crain's. The Rosie was approved by the city before City Hall boosted its affordable housing requirements for new projects, so only seven of the 202 units are designated as affordable.  ""Cedar St. shares our enthusiasm for innovation, and we enjoyed collaborating with them on new concepts like the Ori smart furniture package during development to add value for our renters,"" said David Scherer, principal of Origin Investments, in a statement. ""The Rosie is in one of the most vibrant submarkets in our own backyard and we're excited for a successful lease up."" ",Little Italy
Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is officially a Chicago landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the designation of the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse as a Chicago landmark. Originally built as a loft building in the late nineteenth century, the existing building is from a 1927 reconstruction by architects Hall, Bisbee & Rhenisch that added a concrete internal structure, additional height and a completely new and stylish façade.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is emblematic of changing social patterns that emerged in America after World War I and increased through the boom years of the 1920s, especially increased mobility of American households, urbanization that resulted in families living in smaller apartments, and increased consumption of household goods, some of which like pianos, furs, and wool rugs that required special storage. To meet the demands for increasing mobility and storage, the Jackson Storage and Van Company was part of the household goods and storage industry that emerged and developed throughout the nation during the twentieth century.  The building also meets Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. The design of the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is inspired by Venetian Gothic architecture, and specifically that city’s Doge’s Palace. Examples of Venetian Gothic architecture are rare in Chicago and the nation. With its tapestry brick façade and terra cotta ground level arcade, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse displays a high degree of design and craftsmanship in these traditional materials. The Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is an example of a household storage and moving warehouse, a building type found throughout Chicago characterized by limited fenestration and designs that, when successful, reduce the monolithic character of this building type through ornament and detail. Meeting the separate Integrity Criterion, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse remains in its original location on Cermak Road and its setting on a commercial street serving the residential communities of North and South Lawndale remains little changed since the building was reconstructed to its present form in 1927. The Venetian Gothic design and materials of the building are largely preserved. Changes to the building include replacement of the upper floor windows and the plate-glass storefront windows at the first floor. In addition, steel grates have been added to several windows, though the grates at the windows above the street-level entrances are original and should be preserved. These changes to the building are typical for a building of this vintage and do not sufficiently diminish its integrity The designation will protect all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building and the Batchelder tile water fountain in the first-floor office. The common brick east and west elevations of the building are devoid of architectural treatment and secondary according to the report and more significant changes may be approved for these elevations to support new uses of the building.

Apollo’s 2000 is officially a Chicago landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation of Apollo’s 2000. Located at 2875 W. Cermak, the popular performance and event venue was formerly known as Marshall Square Theatre and was built in 1917 by architect Alexander L Levy. Apollo’s 2000 is the last surviving theater commissioned by Louis and Meyer Marks, Chicago movie exhibitors and theater builders whose business began with a nickelodeon in 1910 to building two of Chicago largest movie palaces, the Granada and Marbro theater in the late 1920s. Since 1990, Apollo’s 2000 has transformed the historic theater to an event and performance space that contributes to the cultural landscape of Little Village and Chicago’s wider Hispanic community by promoting Latin music, lectures and supporting local non-profit organizations.  Apollo’s 2000 showcased Spanish Rock bands in the 1990s, a time when this popular genre was overlooked by Chicago promoters. In addition to Spanish Rock, Apollo’s 2000 has hosted performances from other genres of Latin music, including Spanish Pop, Latin Jazz, Cuban, and Mexican regional musical styles. Apollo’s 2000 has also hosted numerous politicians seeking to reach out to the Latino community, including Vice President Al Gore, former Governor Pat Quinn, Congressman Jesús “Chuy” García, and Senator Bernie Sanders.   The former Marshall Square Theatre is a significant transitional motion picture theater in Chicago from 1917 spanning the small nickelodeons that came before it and the larger and more elaborate movie palaces of the 1920s. With its large arch framed by domed towers, as well as its sculptural eagles, and its ornament derived from classicism, the building is a fine example of Beaux-Arts Architecture applied to an early motion picture theater. The scale and ornate quality of the building’s architecture, on both its interior and exterior, reflect the ideals of historic movie theater design to use architecture as advertisement and to attract customers with a promise of luxury and escape from the ordinary.  As a 107-year-old motion picture theater, Apollo’s 2000 retains sufficient physical integrity to convey its historic and architectural value. Changes to the exterior of the building include refacing of the blade sign and evolution of the marquee, which are common changes to historic movie theaters which frequently updated marquees and signage. Other changes to the exterior include new exterior doors, windows and storefront alterations. These changes are typical for commercial buildings and do not impair the building’s ability to convey its value.  Alterations to the interior of the auditorium were implemented in 1990 to convert the space from a cinema to an event and performance venue. The original seating was removed, the sloped floor was reconfigured with multiple levels, the stage was expanded, and stage lighting was added. These changes have allowed the building to be profitably reused and do not interfere with the architectural quality of the auditorium which is retained in its overall volume as well as ceiling and wall ornamentation. To a lesser degree, the lobby floor has been replaced and interior passage doors from the lobby to the auditorium have been removed. These changes also do not compromise the lobby’s richly ornamented wall and ceiling finishes. The significant features of the building will be all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building, the interior lobby, and the interior of the auditorium. The blade sign and marquee have always been part of the building’s exterior elevations. As with many historic theaters, these features have evolved over time in terms of size, material and illumination. The Commission’s review of work proposed to the blade sign or marquee will ensure that these continue to be features of the building, while allowing reasonable change and flexibility to meet new needs. 1990 changes to the interiors of the lobby and auditorium, including floor finishes, new floor platforms, three bars, neon lighting, chandeliers, stage lighting and its ceiling-mounted trusses, cameras, screens, and bathrooms are specifically excluded from the significant historical and architectural features.

Preliminary landmark approved for Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse. Originally built as a loft building in the late nineteenth century, the existing building is from a 1927 reconstruction by architects Hall, Bisbee & Rhenisch that added a concrete internal structure, additional height and a completely new and stylish façade.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is emblematic of changing social patterns that emerged in America after World War I and increased through the boom years of the 1920s, especially increased mobility of American households, urbanization that resulted in families living in smaller apartments, and increased consumption of household goods, some of which like pianos, furs, and wool rugs that required special storage. To meet the demands for increasing mobility and storage, the Jackson Storage and Van Company was part of the household goods and storage industry that emerged and developed throughout the nation during the twentieth century.  The building also meets Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. The design of the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is inspired by Venetian Gothic architecture, and specifically that city’s Doge’s Palace. Examples of Venetian Gothic architecture are rare in Chicago and the nation. With its tapestry brick façade and terra cotta ground level arcade, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse displays a high degree of design and craftsmanship in these traditional materials. The Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is an example of a household storage and moving warehouse, a building type found throughout Chicago characterized by limited fenestration and designs that, when successful, reduce the monolithic character of this build- 23 ing type through ornament and detail. Meeting the separate Integrity Criterion, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse remains in its original location on Cermak Road and its setting on a commercial street serving the residential communities of North and South Lawndale remains little changed since the building was reconstructed to its present form in 1927. The Venetian Gothic design and materials of the building are largely preserved. Changes to the building include replacement of the upper floor windows and the plate-glass storefront windows at the first floor. In addition, steel grates have been added to several windows, though the grates at the windows above the street-level entrances are original and should be preserved. These changes to the building are typical for a building of this vintage and do not sufficiently diminish its integrity. Based on its evaluation of Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse, the Commission staff recommends that the significant features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building and the Batchelder tile water fountain in the first-floor office. The common brick east and west elevations of the building are devoid of architectural treatment and secondary. The Commission may approve more significant changes to these elevations to support new uses of the building. The foregoing is not intended to limit the Commission’s discretion to approve other changes. With the preliminary recommendation approved, historic preservation staff will develop a landmark report to be presented to the Commission before a final landmark recommendation is voted on. If approved, the proposed designation would head to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. ",Little Village

Plan Commission approves Focal Point Community Campus,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved the proposed Focal Point Community Campus. Located on a large site, the project will occupy approximately 29 acres at the southwestern corner of W. 31st St and S. Kedzie Ave. Planned by Chicago Southwest Development Corporation, the new campus has been in the works for over 10 years.  With a design from HDR, the new campus will facilitate the future construction of multiple buildings. The main anchor will be a new 12-story building for Saint Anthony’s Hospital that will rise 240 feet. In addition, the site will deliver a medical office building, central utility plant (CUP), commercial and retail space, outdoor athletic fields, a vocational school, surgical center, daycare, and office. A total of 1,245 parking spaces are proposed for the site, with most located in a large parking structure that will have the athletic fields topping it.  The complex has been divided into project zones, creating zones for community gathering, health and wellness, education and commerce, and sports and recreation. The developers plan to create a gateway at the intersection of W. 31st St and S. Kedzie Ave. The plan originally included a potential housing component which has been deferred for future consideration and would come back to the Plan Commission for future approvals.  The interior of the site has had the interior streets aligned with the city grid and the parking count was reduced to create an interior recreation trail that reaches from W. 31st St down to S. Kedzie Ave at the southeastern edge of the campus.  The buildout of the site will be divided into two phases, with most of the site coming online at the same time. The hospital building will take the longest time to construct, so it will begin with phase one along with the medical office building, fitness center, community space, education facility, surgical center, retail, and interior site circulation for both pedestrians and vehicles.  The complete buildout of the site will bring the planned office space, incubator and accelerator spaces, daycare, and retail, along with additional outdoor amenities. These components will have shorter construction times, starting after the hospital, but are expected to finish at the same time as the hospital. Landscaping buildout will align with buildout of adjacent programs. The project has undergone multiple revisions and recently acquired the final portion of the property from the City of Chicago for $5 million. The $600 million project will now move on to the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. Demolition permits were recently issued, and work is planned to begin this month. After that planned remediation will begin. New construction is expected to commence in 2023 with completion expected in 2026. ",Little Village
Demo permits issued for Focal Point Community Campus,"Demolition permits have been issued for the existing structures at the proposed Focal Point Community Campus. Addressed at 3345 W. 31st St, the three masonry structures will be replaced by an extensive campus planned by not-for-profit developer Chicago Southwest Development Corporation. The entire project will span 30 acres, fronting W. 31st St to the north and S. Kedzie Ave to the east. The Little Village site will hold a new home for Saint Anthony Hospital, retail, housing, and sports fields. With a design from architecture firm HDR, the latest plan, presented to the Committee on Design in September 2021, encompasses nearly one million square feet of development built in phases. The main structure will be the new hospital tower, rising 12 stories. Rising 206 feet, the structure will house 151 beds for the new Saint Anthony Hospital and will connect to a seven-story outpatient facility via a skybridge. An interconnected structure will hold three floors of parking topped by athletic fields on the roof. The overall development will also deliver retail space, affordable housing, offices, a business incubator, a community center, a daycare facility, a trade school, and an outdoor amphitheater. The community campus will link to the surrounding community via bike and pedestrian connections to the planned El Paseo rails-to-trail project. In the works for over 10 years, the project has undergone multiple revisions and recently acquired the property from the City of Chicago for $5 million. The overall $600 million project will still require approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council. If approvals proceed as planned, new construction is planned for 2023 and completion expected in 2026. ",Little Village
Massive mixed-use Saint Anthony Hospital campus inches forward,"The design of a massive mixed-use campus that includes a new home for Saint Anthony Hospital is starting to take shape in Little Village. Known as the Focal Point Community Campus, the 30-acre project is slated for 3201 W. 31st Street—a vacant parcel once home to the former Washburne Trade School. Not-for-profit developer Chicago Southwest Development Corporation presented updated plans for the site this week at the second meeting of the Chicago Committee on Design. Although the committee lacks the power to approve or block the project, it can make recommendations and provide advisory guidance to the development team and city planners. The somewhat rough renderings—created by architecture firm HDR—suggest the design is likely to continue to evolve. The latest proposal calls for nearly one million square feet of development built in phases. The tallest hospital building tops out at 12 stories (206 feet) and houses 151 beds for Saint Anthony's. It connects to a seven-story outpatient facility and a three-level parking garage capped by baseball and soccer fields. The project also includes new retail space, affordable housing units, offices, a business incubator, a community center, a daycare facility, a trade school, an outdoor amphitheater, and bike and pedestrians connections to the planned El Paseo rails-to-trail project.  The development has been in the works for 10 years and achieved a key milestone in April when the Chicago City Council signed off on a measure to sell the city-owned property to the Focal Point team for $5 million. The estimated $600 million project still requires zoning approval from the city. The developers hope to begin construction in 2023 and welcome patients in 2026—if approvals go as planned. A video of the Committee on Design meeting can be viewed here.  ",Little Village

Developer plans residential at 1805 N. Campbell,"Local developer CKG Realty Group has proposed a residential development at 1805 N. Campbell. Located on the northeast corner of N. Campbell Ave and W. Bloomingdale Ave, the project site is currently home to a two-story residential building.  Presenting four different options, the developer envisioned either a four or five-story building with or without parking.  The first option, planned as a five-story building, would have 32 residential units, with 6 of them affordable, and 9 parking spaces. Option 2 would also be a five-story building, but would not include parking, resulting in an increase of the unit count to 35 with 7 of them as affordable.  The third scheme would be a four-story building with 28 units, 6 of them affordable, and 9 parking spaces. The final option would also be a four-story building with the lack of parking resulting in an increase of units to 31 with 6 of them set aside as affordable. Across all options, the building would have four residential units on the ground floor facing W. Bloomingdale Ave with the residential entry along N. Campbell Ave at the middle of the building. The back portion of the ground floor would either have nine parking spaces or three additional residential units.  The second through fourth floors of each option would have eight units per floor split into four two-beds and four one-beds. For the five-story buildings, the fifth floor would have four three-bedroom units.   The project will need to rezone the site from M1-1 to B2-3 to allow for the scope of the development.

The residential entry will face N. Campbell Ave and the previously sunken parking will now be a surface lot that is partially underneath the footprint of the building. Up above, the massing has changed from a pure rectangle, with indents added along the north elevation to incorporate balconies into the facade for residents. Apartments facing the back of the building will have metal hanging balconies. To allow for the development, SNS Realty Group is requesting a zoning change from B3-1 to B2-3. The developers are still looking to gain approval from the alderman, with another 6-9 months expected for the formal rezoning and variance process afterwards. Assuming all approvals go to plan, construction will take a year, putting the project at completion around Spring 2025. ",Logan Square
Renderings emerge for Logan Square Blue Line station rehab,"The Logan Square CTA Blue Line station will be getting a rehab at the corner of N. Kedzie Ave and N. Milwaukee Ave. Planned by the Chicago Transit Authority and Chicago Department of Transportation, the renovation would be the first major work done to it since it opened in 1970. With Jacobs Engineering designing the project, the design is not entirely finalized, but the released renderings indicate a new exit canopy structure. Showing a curved roofline, the canopy covers the stairwell and elevators coming up from the station platform underground with skylights and colored glass. As part of the rehab, CDOT will be reconstructing the area surrounding the station exit. Kedzie Ave will be rerouted and turned to the northwest of the station exit, intersecting N. Milwaukee Ave at what is currently the bus turnaround. This change will allow for the construction of La Placita, a pedestrian plaza and green space that has been planned for a long time.  The city is also reconstructing N. Milwaukee Ave between W. Belmont Avenue and the square. Construction on the N. Kedzie Avenue reroute and N. Milwaukee Avenue upgrades are expected to begin later this year and wrap up in 2025, but a timeline for the station rehab is currently unclear. The project is being supported with an estimated $11.8 million in federal grants and $10-15 million in TIF funding. ",Logan Square
Encuentro Square celebrates groundbreaking,"Development partners and elected officials gathered yesterday to celebrate the groundbreaking of Encuentro Square, a two-building, multifamily development in Logan Square at 3759 W. Cortland St. and 1844 N. Ridgeway Ave., at the western edge of the 606 Trail. Developed by Latin United Community Housing Association (LUCHA) and Evergreen Real Estate Group, the property was the site of the former Magid Glove factory. “Gentrification pressure in the Logan Square community has resulted in a significant reduction in naturally occurring affordable housing stock for the area, leading to changes in demographics that have accelerated over the past decade with the development of the 606 Trail,” said DOH Acting Commissioner Jim R. Horan. “Encuentro Square puts a stake in the ground in a highly visible location that confirms the City’s commitment to these 89 households being able to call Logan Square home.” Designed by Canopy / architecture + design, the development will provide 89 affordable units at or below 60% of AMI. Encuentro Square’s amenities will include a community services lobby and community room, a teaching kitchen, on-site management offices, bike storage, a children’s room, and lounge and courtyard. Community support services will also be available to tenants, including home-based head start in partnership with the Children’s Place Association, as well as financial training and counseling. 70 of the 89 total units are family-sized units (two-bedrooms or larger). Fifty-five units will benefit from long-term project-based rental assistance administered by the CHA, of which 44 are family-sized units. “CHA is proud to be a key partner in Encuentro Square, a project that demonstrates what can be accomplished when stakeholders from the public and private sectors join together to ensure affordable housing in rapidly gentrifying communities like Logan Square. Thanks to CHA’s funding support, 55 of the 89 families in these new buildings will have the security of long-term housing stability. With this rental assistance, families who live in Logan Square – and who love Logan Square – can remain in this community for years to come,” said CHA CEO Tracey Scott. Encuentro Square is being funded with approximately $32,300,000 in equity generated by City- sourced Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, $1,666,400 in funds generated by state tax credits from the City’s donation of the project property, $9,000,000 in City-sourced TIF funds, $14,827,230 in City-sourced loan funds, and private mortgage debt of $6,780,000, among other sources. ""Encuentro Square is the culmination of many years of planning and hard work by dozens of public and private entities. Evergreen is proud to make this community vision a reality and provide critical affordable housing for families living near the western terminus of the 606 Trail,"" said David Block, Director of Development at Evergreen Real Estate Group. ""LUCHA is incredibly proud to continue to build on our more than 40-year history of providing affordable housing to our community. We look forward to adding these units to the stock of permanently affordable housing, turning a vacant lot not just into housing, but into homes,” said Lissette Castaneda, Executive Director at LUCHA. In relation to but funded and implemented separately from the Encuentro Square development, the Chicago Park District will take ownership of a portion of the site that is to be redeveloped for use as a public park that will connect with the 606 Trail. With Leopardo Companies serving as the general contractor, construction has begun on the taller structure at 1844 N. Ridgeway, with permits issued for the second building at 3759 W. Cortland as well.

City Council approves funding for Congress Theater,"The City Council has approved the allocation of $27 million in TIF funding to support the redevelopment of the long-vacant Congress Theater. Located at 2135 N. Milwaukee, the historic Congress Theater sits at the corner of N Milwaukee Avenue and N Rockwell Street. Baum Revision has taken over as the developer, replacing previous developers who failed to move the project forward. Designed by Woodhouse Tinucci Architects, the plan for the rehabilitation includes a full historic restoration to the theater, retail, and housing space. Work will restore the existing finishes without altering the layout or organization of rooms within the structure. The renovation will upgrade all of the mechanicals of the structure, including ventilation, electrical, plumbing, and the roof. New windows will be installed that will match the character of the original windows. Beyond the theater, the property fronts the street with 13,000 square feet of retail space and two levels of residential space. Storefronts will be renovated and made to match the original storefront layouts. 16 apartments, 14 of them affordable, will be included in the Milwaukee Ave building including studio, one-bed, and two-bedroom units. No parking will be included within the development. The $88 million plan will use the $27 million in TIF alongside other funding sources to finance the project. A key part of the city’s approval included the three-year extension of the TIF district, giving the developer more time before the TIF funding expires. With these final approvals secured, the development is ready to move forward with permitting and construction. A timeline for completion is currently unknown. ",Logan Square
Residential development proposed at 1815 N. California,"A residential development has been proposed at 1815 N. California. Planned by developers Stanislaw Chodak and Wes Khan, the vacant property is midblock along N. California Ave near the popular 606 bike and running trail. Designed by Hanna Architects, the new five-story building would hold 24 apartments with 24 car parking spaces provided in the building. The unit mix will consist of three one-bed units all on the ground floor facing the street, with 19 two-beds and 2 three-beds on the upper floors. Set to rise 55 feet, the building has been designed with a two-tone brick facade that frames the windows and balconies of each unit. The fifth floor has been setback from the property line significantly to reduce its visual while providing large rooftop decks for the three units on the fifth floor. All units will have private balconies. Seeking a zoning change for the site, the developers are currently seeking approval from the local alderman before proceeding through the review process at City Hall. To meet affordability requirements, five apartments would be reserved as affordable. ",Logan Square
Permit issued for second building at Encuentro Square,"A full building permit has been issued for the second building of Encuentro Square, an all-affordable residential development just west of the 606-trail terminus.

12-story apartment building planned at Wabash and Cermak,"In the South Loop, developer Draper & Kramer is seeking city approval for a 12-story apartment project near McCormick Place at the northeast corner of Wabash Avenue and Cermak Road. If approved, the 150-foot-tall building will rise just south of the developer's 24-story Aspire apartments, which opened in 2020. The proposal replaces a vacant lot that was previously occupied by a muffler shop and used as a staging area during the construction of Aspire. According to a zoning application filed with the city, the upcoming structure would contain 150 rental units (including 15 on-site affordable units), ground-floor retail, and parking for 74 cars. Like its Aspire neighbor to the north, the design of the project comes from architecture firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz.  In 2015, Draper & Kramer originally pitched—and received approval for—a seven-story, 144-room hotel for the prominent corner parcel. Since that time, the blocks surrounding McCormick Place have welcome several notable new developments. In addition to Aspire, other prominent projects in the area include the Wintrust Arena, the 1,205-room Marriott Marquis, and the 466-room Hiltons at McCormick Place Hotel. Draper & Kramer declined to comment on the recent zoning application.

Demolition of Damen Silos delayed for federal review,"The ultimate fate of the Damen Silos has been delayed after the city announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be reviewing the pending demolition and will require its own permit.  “Consequently, the City of Chicago will defer its decision on the demolition application pending the outcome of the federal permitting and NEPA review process and related community engagement, which may involve or raise environmental issues and mitigation measures relevant to the City's review.”  Located along the Chicago River near the intersection of S. Damen Ave and W. 29th St, the state sold the 20-acre riverfront property at the end of last year to Michael Tadin Jr. and his family for $6.5 million. Tadin is also part owner of MAT Asphalt in McKinley Park. Tadin has reportedly not decided exactly what the future will hold for the site, but the property will be redeveloped after the demolition is complete.  ",McKinley Park
City announces winner of Pershing Road RFP,"A $121 million project that includes mixed-income housing, commercial offices and retail space was announced as the winner of a Chicago Department of Planning and Development Request for Proposals to redevelop a historic city-owned property in McKinley Park. The project site at 1769 W. Pershing measures approximately 6.5 acres. Planned by IBT Group LLC, the project will repurpose a vacant 571,000-square-foot warehouse known as the Quartermaster Depot, which was built in 1918 for the U.S. Army. The six-story structure, featuring 90,000-square-foot floor plates and located within McKinley Park’s Central Manufacturing District complex, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by Epstein, the rehab will remove a center section of the building to create two partially detached structures with a shared interior courtyard. One structure will include 120 mixed-income apartments ranging from studios to three-bedroom units. The other will become a 200,445-square-foot innovative office hub and technology incubator. Approximately 120 parking spaces and rooftop amenities will serve tenants and visitors of both structures. The facade and other historic elements of the complex will be preserved and restored. The eastern portion of the site, which currently contains a one-story City maintenance facility, will be redeveloped as a 50,000-square-foot grocery store. Approximately 130 parking spaces will be available for store patrons and workers. ""The Pershing Road project is an example of how innovative thinking and design can breathe new life into our historic spaces, while expanding affordable housing opportunities for Chicagoans,"" Mayor Brandon Johnson said. ""I look forward to the potential this project holds to revitalize the McKinley Park community, including plans for mixed-income housing, a grocery store, and office space to benefit neighbors and create jobs.""  The development site is valued at approximately $6.7 million, minus environmental remediation costs that are yet to be determined. The developer’s anticipated request for city support could include up to $25 million in TIF funding pending formal review and approval processes that include City Council review. ARCO/Murray and Englewood Construction will lead the construction once approved. ",McKinley Park
Developers present proposals for Pershing RFP,"Three competing developer teams have presented their proposals to the community for the redevelopment of city-owned property at 1769 W. Pershing. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development issued an RFP back in July 2022, seeking proposals to rehab the vacant, city-owned warehouse. Located in McKinley Park’s historic Central Manufacturing District, the RFP has an option to include an adjacent 3.2-acre site for new construction.  Here is a breakdown of each proposal:   IBT Group LLC IBT Group LLC is proposing to renovate the historic warehouse building with 200,000 square feet of flexible office space and 120 residential units. Opting to include Site B, the team would redevelop that site with a one-story 50,000-square foot retail building that they are targeting for a grocery tenant.  The developer is partnering with Inherent L3C for the housing portion and has tapped Epstein and Site Design Group for the design, with ARCO Murray and Englewood Construction on deck for building the project. The design would carve out the center of the building to allow for units and office space to access light, with the exterior of the building preserved. The roof will have an activated roof deck complete with educational space, solar power generation, community-based programming and a ½ mile running track.   The $120 million development would be funded with $18-30 million in C-PACE funding, $12-24 million in federal historic tax credits, $3 million in state historic tax credits, $6-12 million federal grants, $12-18 million in equity, and $39-63 million in debt that is expected to include some TIF funding.   Outpost Studios LLC Outpost Studios LLC is planning to convert the existing warehouse building into studio space for movies, TV shows, commercials, and music. The creative campus will include a new production studio on Site B and add 40 residential units to the rooftop of the warehouse building. At the ground floor, a large public food hall will face W. Pershing Rd. The project team, led by Cacciatore Capital, includes Just Don, Chicago Media Angels, and Morgan Stanley, with Holabird & Root leading the design. Walsh Construction would serve as the general contractor for the project.  The design calls for a ground floor food hall and flex space, with parking at the back. Set storage, set construction, wardrobe storage and wardrobe workshop spaces will be located on the second floor. The upper floors will hold the planned studios, with the aforementioned rooftop housing topping off the building. The 40 residential units will comply with the city’s ARO requirements. The $110 million project would be funded with $50 million in debt, $36 million in equity, $12 million in TIF funding, and $10 million in tax credits.   Pershing Road Studios Planned by LG Development and KMW Communities, Pershing Road Studios would build large sound stages on the site in collaboration with Cinelease Studios. With a design from Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the site will become home to six sound stages, back-of-house space for production staff, and 13,000 square feet of community amenity space. The back portion of the warehouse would be demolished to make room for two of the sound stages, with the leftover historic warehouse making up an L-shape. These elevations would be repaired and restored. The street-facing wing will have 13,000 square feet of space set aside for a community amenity space on the ground floor, with 100 car parking spaces on the second and third floors above.  The lower five floors of the southern wing will hold all of the back-of-house spaces for the productions, including production offices, props, wardrobe, lighting, storage, and catering. The top floors of the leftover warehouse building will be available as 45,000 square feet of flex space that could be leased to outside office tenants or accommodate an expansion of the production facility. The plan calls for the remaining four sound stages to be built on Site B, with 300 surface parking spaces located at the back of the site. – With each developer presenting their plans, DPD is seeking community feedback in the next couple of weeks. The final selection is expected in early April, upon which the chosen developer will begin a city review process that will include a Planned Development application for the project.  ",McKinley Park
DPD announces Pershing Road RFP finalists,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has announced the three finalists for their Pershing Road RFP. Issued back in July 2022, the RFP is seeking to rehab a vacant, city-owned warehouse at 1769 W. Pershing. Located in McKinley Park’s historic Central Manufacturing District, the RFP has an option to include an adjacent 3.2-acre site for new construction.  The RFP’s goals include the creation of a mix of private uses that foster additional neighborhood economic investment and enhance employment options for area residents, among other neighborhood needs. With five submissions by private developers, the proposals were evaluated by an RFP selection team in December 2022 and three of the five responses were short-listed for additional community and City review.  Here are the three short-listed proposals: IBT Group LLC The first finalist is IBT Group LLC, who propose to rehab the vacant warehouse at 1769 W. Pershing into 120 units of mixed-income housing and 200,000 square feet of commercial offices, lab space, and retail space. The building would be served by 120 exterior car parking spaces. The developers are also looking to take advantage of the adjacent 3.2-acre property by redeveloping it with a 50,000-square-foot retail building and 132 parking spaces. The proposal is expected to cost $121 million. LG Pershing Sound Studios LLC Proposed by LG Pershing Sound Studios LLC, the second finalist would rehab the warehouse at 1769 W. Pershing into 114,000 square feet of commercial offices, 40,000 square feet of movie studio space, and 13,500 square feet of retail space. The scheme would include indoor parking for 100 cars and exterior parking for 300 cars and 25 semi-trucks. The 3.2-acre adjacent site would be redeveloped with 79,200 square feet of movie studio space. This project would cost $95.1 million. Quartermaster Outpost Studio LLC The third finalist is Quartermaster Outpost Studio LLC, who would rehab the warehouse at 1769 W. Pershing into approximately 425,000 square feet of mixed-use business space, with an additional floor added for 40 mixed-income residential units. Exterior parking for 123 cars would be provided. Their plan for the 3.2-acre site would be the development of a 75,000-square-foot movie studio space and exterior parking. This final scheme would cost $90 million. -- The proposals will be presented for public consideration in February 2023 through presentations, surveys and other opportunities to provide feedback. A final selection could be announced by DPD by summer 2023, with additional city and public review processes to follow. ",McKinley Park
Adaptive reuse plan for historic McKinley Park warehouses progresses,"Near McKinley Park, a pair of former warehouses are one step closer to becoming a new mixed-use, mixed-income complex after winning the support of the Chicago Plan Commission by an unusually tight margin.  In discussion for more than two years, the proposal from New York-based developer Code RE Partners, Inc. and non-profit Hispanic Housing Development Corporation will breathe new life into the six-story buildings located just south of McKinley Park proper. The property at 2159 W. Pershing Road would be converted into 120 affordable apartments priced at 30 to 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI) and would be rebranded as the ""Parkview Lofts.""  The adjacent building at 2139 W. Pershing Road would be converted into ""Parkview Commerce,"" a mixed-use development with commercial space for small businesses on the first, second, and third floors plus 39 units of market-rate housing on levels four through six. The structures are both located in the southwest side's historic Central Manufacturing District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and have an orange rating in the Chicago Historic Resources Survey. The plan also includes a new landscaped courtyard located between the two former warehouses and 141 parking spaces in a ground-floor garage and a surface lot behind the Parkview Commerce building.  The design of the adaptive reuse plan comes from Chicago's FitzGerald Associates Architects, and Power Construction will serve as general contractor. The developers estimate the cost of the project at $41 million and have already secured low-income housing tax credits to help finance the work. City officials praised the proposal for restoring historically significant buildings and bringing much-need affordable housing to a transit-served location in a gentrifying neighborhood, but also raised health-related concerns due to the site's proximity to heavy industry, including an active asphalt plant to the south.  Although the development team presented plans for a two-stage air filtration system that would exceed all requirements, the discussion highlighted a larger issue of how pollution disproportionally impacts Chicago's lower-income residents and communities of color.  Ald. George Cardenas (12th), whose ward includes the properties, defended his support for the Pershing Road proposal. ""This is my second year with this plan, trying to create affordable housing, and we're here today because it's been vetted and re-vetted,"" said the elected official. ""...not to approve this would be a slap in the face to many of the families that are looking to stay in the neighborhood."" After spending more than two hours reviewing and debating the proposal, the Chicago Plan Commission issued an unusual split decision and approved the project by a relatively tight 7 - 4 margin. The redevelopment plan for 2139 and 2159 W. Pershing Road will now go before the Committee on Zoning and full Chicago City Council for final approval.  ",McKinley Park
Transit-oriented development headed to McKinley Park,"While transit-oriented development has spread like wildfire around CTA lines on the North Side, TOD mania has been slow to gain traction on the city's South and West sides. That could soon change in McKinley Park where plans are advancing to bring a transit-oriented project to a vacant lot near the 35th Street CTA Orange Line stop. Archer Homes Developments Inc. recently filed a zoning application to rezone the parcel at 3595 S. Archer Avenue from C1-2 to B2-3. If approved by the city, the rezoning measure would clear a path for a new four-story building with a commercial space and two live-work units on the ground floor and 27 dwelling units on the upper floors. Designed by Thomas Architects, the plan would still provide on-site parking for 23 cars and 36 bicycles. The existing flagpole and historical marker dedicated to early Chicago explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet will remain at the corner of Archer Avenue and Leavitt Street.  Redeveloping the area's vacant lots near the Ashland and 35th/Archer CTA stops into transit-oriented, multifamily developments is identified as a key component of the 2021 McKinley Park neighborhood plan. The results of a recent survey published earlier this month by the McKinley Park Development Council show ""general support for higher-density development near transit,"" McKinley Park News reported.   ",McKinley Park
Residential conversion proposed at 811 W. Evergreen,"A zoning application has been submitted for a proposed residential conversion at 811 W. Evergreen. Located along W. Evergreen Ave just west of N.

City Council approves 450-foot-tall tower at 1565 N. Clybourn,"The Chicago City Council has approved New York-based developer The Georgetown Company’s plans for a mixed-use tower at 1565 N. Clybourn. Located at the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Halsted St, the new development will replace the retail structure that formerly held the Bank of America branch. The developer owns the four-story parking garage and the retail structure with Design Within Reach and will retain both of those structures as part of the development. With bKL Architecture on board for the design, the team sought to create something special and unique for the prominent gateway site for this area. The new mixed-use tower will rise with a very slender massing, tapering at the ends to create a unique profile. The tower’s glass and metal facade will come down to the ground without a large parking podium, meeting the ground in an elegant and pedestrian-friendly way. The facade switches to a masonry expression at the base with punched window openings to relate to the pedestrian scale. Rising 37 stories, the 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 residential units, with 79 of them set aside as affordable. The unit mix will feature 99 studios, 264 one-beds, and 33 two-beds. The 79 affordable units will include 26 units at 30% AMI, 7 units at 40% AMI, and 46 units at 80% AMI. The ground floor will front N. Clybourn Ave with 2,500 square feet of retail space, with the residential entry facing back to the internal drive and north towards the pedestrian plaza designed by Confluence. Amenity space will be located on the third floor with an outdoor cutout in the building massing as well as rooftop amenities on the 37th floor which will include an outdoor pool. In regard to parking, the new building will have no new car parking spaces but will include 396 bike parking spaces on the third floor. The existing parking garage behind the new construction has 158 parking spaces. The developer plans to make 70 of them available to residents, 73 available for retail parking, and 15 spaces for employees. An internal private drive that currently exists will remain for internal circulation as well as drop off and loading. With approval secured, the site will be rezoned from its existing PD to B3-5 and the Planned Development will be reinstated. Construction on the $175 million development could begin as soon as early 2025 with a 20–22-month construction timeline.  ",Near North
$31 million in construction financing secured for 1535 N.

Fronting N. Fremont St south of W. North Ave, the site is bound by the Toyota of Lincoln Park to the north and west and an alley to the south.  Designed by NORR, the new mixed-use building will stand 5 floors high, delivering 132 residential units and approximately 8,000 square feet of retail space. The project’s unit mix will include 112 studios, 12 one-beds, and 8 two-beds. Residents will have access to 29 car parking spaces and 132 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. Cars will enter via a curb cut and garage entry along N. Fremont St at the southern end of the building.  Measuring 75 feet tall, the building will be designed with storefront glazing and brick at the ground floor to provide visibility along the street for the retail space. The residential entry is announced with an interruption in the brick base with a bay of the upper facade coming down to meet a framed opening for the entry. The mass of the upper floors has been broken down into smaller bays clad in three tones of fiber cement paneling and separated with dark gray ribbed metal panels. The development’s ARO obligation is for 26.4 units, so the developer will provide 26 units on site at an average of 60% AMi and pay $60,000 in a fee in-lieu for the remaining 0.4 of a unit. With financing in place, the developers are set to begin construction imminently here within the third quarter of 2024.

Designed by Eckenhoff Saunders Architects, the 36,000-square-foot building will be turned into a collaborative space that offers teens a black box theater, gymnasium, state-of-the-art culinary kitchen, art studios, STEM labs, wood shop and outdoor spaces for urban gardening. The nonprofit expects the building to serve approximately 1,500 teens each year. The organization bought the building for more than $12 million and is fundraising a total of $27 million to cover the entire renovation cost. The community space is slated to open in 2025.

1535 N. Fremont scores full building permit,"A full building permit has been issued for the mixed-use development planned at 1535 N. Fremont. Fronting N. Fremont St south of W. North Ave, the site is bound by the Toyota of Lincoln Park to the north and west and an alley to the south. With CityPads as the developer, the project will replace a vacant surface parking lot. Designed by NORR, the new mixed-use building will stand 5 floors high, delivering 132 residential units and approximately 8,000 square feet of retail space. The project’s unit mix will include 112 studios, 12 one-beds, and 8 two-beds. Residents will have access to 29 car parking spaces and 132 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. Cars will enter via a curb cut and garage entry along N. Fremont St at the southern end of the building.  Measuring 75 feet tall, the building will be designed with storefront glazing and brick at the ground floor to provide visibility along the street for the retail space. The residential entry is announced with an interruption in the brick base with a bay of the upper facade coming down to meet a framed opening for the entry. The mass of the upper floors has been broken down into smaller bays clad in three tones of fiber cement paneling and separated with dark gray ribbed metal panels. The development’s ARO obligation is for 26.4 units, so the developer will provide 26 units on site at an average of 60% AMi and pay $60,000 in a fee in-lieu for the remaining 0.4 of a unit. With the full building permit issued in addition to the foundation permit, general contractor ENC Construction & Development can begin building the $40 million development and work through completion.  ",Near North
"Redevelopment plan for Cabrini Green could total over 5,000 units","The Chicago Housing Authority recently presented a redevelopment plan for the remaining Cabrini Green sites. Developed as part of Cabrini NOW, the community-driven planning and design effort looks to improve the Cabrini neighborhood through new housing and economic development on CHA properties. SCB is the architect working on the masterplans. Generally bound by W. North Ave to the north, the Brown Line tracks to the east, W. Chicago Ave to the south, and N. Halsted St to the west, the plan encompasses 16 different parcels including vacant parcels and the vacant Francis Cabrini Rowhomes. The design strategies are split into the southern and northern sites divided by W. Division St. -- Northern Sites The northern sites center around the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Larrabee St as well as the sites along W. Division St between N. Halsted St and N. Cleveland Ave. Totaling 16 acres of land, all of the plans will preserve Strangers Home Missionary Baptist Church with a public open plaza in front of it. The first development strategy for the northern sites will total 1,050 residential units which will include 104 townhomes and 946 multifamily units. The 1.2 million square foot plan would have 0.3 acres of open space and 565 parking spaces. The plan would concentrate larger buildings at the Division/Halsted intersection while complementing the scale of existing development along N. Larrabee St and N. Clybourn Ave corridors. The scheme would provide less housing than the market would suggest, potentially leading to difficulty financing this development plan. The second development strategy would have 1,450 residential units split between 50 townhomes and 1,400 multifamily units. The 1.5 million square foot plan would have 0.3 acres of open space while providing 730 parking spaces. The scheme would match the mid-rise scale of CHA Near North developments to date while the largest buildings are still concentrated on the Division/Halsted intersection. This version would have the potential to highlight Strangers Home Missionary Baptist Church but would have fewer low-rise buildings overall. As the densest version, the third development scenario has 2,000 residential units with no townhomes and all of the units in multifamily buildings. The 1.9 million square foot plan would have a full acre of open space and 665 parking spaces. The plan provides the greatest amount of housing with a greater chance of successful development financing. It would have the most open space, have potential for a new fire station on N. Larrabee St, and have the potential to highlight Strangers Home Missionary Baptist Church. This version has the least amount of low-scale development, taller buildings are spread more evenly across the sites, and the potential new fire station could complicate the development process. -- Southern Sites The southern sites span from W. Chicago Ave up to W. Oak St with a total of nine parcels that total approximately 27 acres. The sites include the vacant Cabrini Rowhomes. The first development strategy for the southern sites will total 2,000 residential units which will include 215 renovated townhomes, 35 new townhomes and 1,940 multifamily units. The 2 million square foot plan would have a full acre of open space and 650 parking spaces. The plan would have an improved pedestrian environment and vehicular connectivity while preserving most of the vacant rowhomes. New medium scale development on N. Cambridge Ave allows for more housing while Seward and Durso Parks would be connected via a dedicated open space for a commemorative walk. The costly renovations of the historic buildings would yield fewer units while historic structures are isolated from new neighborhood development. The second scheme for the southern sites will total 1,800 residential units which will include 125 renovated townhomes, 15 new townhomes and 1,985 multifamily units. The 1.7 million square foot plan would have a full acre of open space and 600 parking spaces. The plan would have an improved pedestrian environment and vehicular connectivity with less costs associated with moderate historic preservation. Historic structures are less isolated from new neighborhood development and Seward and Durso Parks would be connected via a dedicated open space for a commemorative walk. Preserving N. Mohawk Ave and N. Cleveland Ave limits block sizes and the amount of housing the sites can accommodate while costly renovations of the large number of historic buildings yields the fewest residential units. The final scheme for the southern sites totals 2,050 residential units with 65 renovated townhomes, 15 new townhomes, and 1,970 multifamily units. The 2 million square foot plan would have a full acre of open space and 650 parking spaces. The plan would have the most new housing as limited historic preservation allows for more efficient allocation of financial resources. The plan would have an improved pedestrian environment and vehicular connectivity and Seward and Durso Parks would be connected via a dedicated open space for a commemorative walk. A disadvantage of the plan is that there is less historic preservation and limited preservation of street and neighborhood character. -- After receiving community feedback, the team will refine the concepts, undergo a feasibility analysis, and develop documentation. The final Cabrini NOW reports will be submitted in October or November of this year. ",Near North

Gensler reimagines North Michigan Ave corridor,"In a time where Michigan Avenue’s status as a key anchor for the city is in flux post-COVID, global architecture firm Gensler has developed a vision for the corridor in collaboration with veteran real estate investors and brokers Bob Wislow and Camille Julmy of Parkside Realty. The COVID era undoubtedly damaged high streets across the world. North Michigan Avenue saw 6.5 million fewer visits per year, accompanied by a 74% increase in crime; 25-35% decrease in property tax value; massive losses of sales, hotel, and entertainment taxes; and over 2,000 jobs lost. Despite these challenges, the district continues to employ and entertain residents from all 50 city wards while still generating 18% of citywide hospitality spending, hosting visitors from around the world.   North Michigan Avenue was ready for its next evolution prior to COVID, having not seen major transformation since the 1990s, but today – given the changes in consumer habits, expectations, and lifestyles resulting from the pandemic – it is urgently poised for reinvention. Chicago’s economy, job market, global reputation, and culture depend on it.   ""Michigan Avenue is a vital engine of commerce, tourism, and culture in Chicago, and it's worth investing in its evolution to ensure it is an accessible, dynamic, vibrant part of our city for years to come,"" said Benjy Ward, Design Principal at Gensler.  By researching the shared components of global high streets and the current situation on Michigan Avenue, the team identified the northern end of North Michigan Avenue, between Chicago Avenue and Oak Street Beach, as the area with the greatest potential to elevate the North Michigan Avenue experience.  At Jane Byrne Park, the vision includes a road diet along N. Michigan Ave creates more pedestrian space, bench planters that create a canopy over the park, cafe kiosk to offer food and beverage, an interactive water feature, projection art, and colorful bistro tables to offer seating.  Along the entire streetscape, the corridor’s envisioned road diet would make way for improvements that include art, seating, planters, cafe kiosks, lighting, performance platforms, smart pavers, and safety concierge and cameras.  At the northern end of N. Michigan Ave, the vision looks to reimagine Oak Street Beach and better connect it to the corridor with a large sweeping pedestrian bridge over Lake Shore Drive. The park will be extended down N. Michigan Ave along the Drake Hotel and redesigned north of E. Oak St.  While the visionary images have been shared with the city, there is currently no specific timeline for implementing the concept.

Plan Commission approves 450-foot-tall tower at 1565 N. Clybourn,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved New York-based developer The Georgetown Company’s plans for a mixed-use tower at 1565 N. Clybourn. Located at the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Halsted St, the new development will replace the retail structure that formerly held the Bank of America branch. The developer owns the four-story parking garage and the retail structure with Design Within Reach and will retain both of those structures as part of the development. With bKL Architecture on board for the design, the team sought to create something special and unique for the prominent gateway site for this area. The new mixed-use tower will rise with a very slender massing, tapering at the ends to create a unique profile. The tower’s glass and metal facade will come down to the ground without a large parking podium, meeting the ground in an elegant and pedestrian-friendly way. The facade switches to a masonry expression at the base with punched window openings to relate to the pedestrian scale. Rising 37 stories, the 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 residential units, with 79 of them set aside as affordable. The unit mix will feature 99 studios, 264 one-beds, and 33 two-beds. The 79 affordable units will include 26 units at 30% AMI, 7 units at 40% AMI, and 46 units at 80% AMI. The ground floor will front N. Clybourn Ave with 2,500 square feet of retail space, with the residential entry facing back to the internal drive and north towards the pedestrian plaza designed by Confluence. Amenity space will be located on the third floor with an outdoor cutout in the building massing as well as rooftop amenities on the 37th floor which will include an outdoor pool. In regard to parking, the new building will have no new car parking spaces but will include 396 bike parking spaces on the third floor. The existing parking garage behind the new construction has 158 parking spaces. The developer plans to make 70 of them available to residents, 73 available for retail parking, and 15 spaces for employees. An internal private drive that currently exists will remain for internal circulation as well as drop off and loading. The developer is looking to rezone the site from its existing PD to B3-5 and then reinstate the Planned Development. If approvals move forward according to plan, construction could begin in early 2025 with a 20–22-month construction timeline. With approval from the Chicago Plan Commission secured, the $175 million development can now go before the Committee on Zoning and City Council. ",Near North

Urbanize tours 868 N. Wells at North Union,"Urbanize has visited the construction site of 868 N. Wells, the latest residential tower at North Union. Planned by JDL Development, the building occupies a rectangular site along N. Wells St stretching from W. Chestnut St to W. Locust St. With a design by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, 868 N. Wells will stand 26 floors high with 411 rental units and 12,000 square feet of retail space. Touring with Power Construction and JDL Development, the tour began by heading up to the top of the building to the 26th floor. Set to hold the building’s amenity spaces, the floor is enclosed but sits raw with construction equipment filling up the space. At the south end, the amenity space will open up to an outdoor deck that includes a rooftop pool. An outdoor dog run will be included on the west side of the amenity level. Going one floor down, the 25th level will be the top residential floor. The floor plate is fully enclosed with the glass facade and the first mechanical systems are being installed. Working our way down the building, our next stop was the two duplex apartments on the north end of the building’s 20th and 21st floors. The 21st floor shows the units fully framed with crews installing electrical wiring during our walkthrough. On the 20th floor, crews were closing up the walls with drywall.  Heading down the building, our next stop was the 12th floor, where drywall and paint has been completed, with cabinets going in for the units’ kitchens. Stopping at the third floor, we next saw some finished units that have kitchens and bathrooms installed as well as flooring and all other finishes. Residents will benefit from nine and a half feet high ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows that give unencumbered views of the city around it. On the ground floor, we walked through the future retail space that will face north and west into the future park space. As part of the first phase of North Union, the park will open at the same time as 868 N. Wells. JDL Development plans to begin pre-leasing at the end of April 2024, with Power Construction turning over the building in July 2024 for late-Summer 2024 move-ins. As construction wraps up on 868 N.

The first phase of the project aims to begin in spring 2025 on property that is today surface parking lots adjacent to the arena.  Innovative green space is strategically integrated on the west side of the campus including on top of parking garages, providing more than 25 acres of public recreational and community gathering space. The plan calls for reimagined parking facilities and an improved pedestrian experience with enhanced walkability, lighting, roads and bike lanes uniquely designed to blend into the development. Future phase development envisions housing that spans various unit sizes and includes affordable, market rate and luxury housing to ensure a vibrant mix of residential offerings for single persons and families.  Transportation enhancements will better connect the neighborhood through multi-modal means including bike, pedestrian, car and rail enhancements.  Immersed in green spaces and sustainability features as well as decorative lighting, pedestrian plazas and landscaping will also aid in community safety and accessibility. The $7 billion investment will need a zoning change to rezone all of the parcels to a unified C1-5 with a Planned Development designation. Typical approvals will be necessary from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. While Phase 1 is targeted to begin in 2025, the overall plan is expected to span over 10 years. ",Near West Side
Permits issued for multi-building development at 1310 S. Ashland,"A series of permits have been issued for a multi-building mixed-use development located at 1310 S. Ashland. Planned by Domus Real Estate Group, the project site is bound by W. 13th St to the north, S. Ashland Ave to the east, and W. Hastings St to the south. A demolition permit was recently issued to clear the former Urban Prairie Waldorf School and Moses Montefiore Academy building that currently occupies the site.

City celebrates opening of Damen Green Line station,"Mayor Brandon Johnson today joined 27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett, Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) President Dorval R. Carter, Jr., Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) Commissioner Tom Carney and Near West Side stakeholders to announce the opening of the new CTA Damen Green Line station at Lake St and Damen Ave. “This new station is a transformational achievement for our city,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “The long-awaited Damen Green Line on the Near West Side of Chicago will have a multiplying effect on this neighborhood, attracting future investments for a vibrant hub of multi-use developments.”   The new Damen Green Line station fills a 1.5-mile service gap between Ashland and California stops, restoring rail service to the neighborhood for the first time since the original station was closed at this location in 1948. The station serves the Kinzie Industrial Corridor, the United Center, Malcolm X College, and the surrounding residential area on the growing Near West Side. This includes the Chicago Housing Authority’s Westhaven Park IID, a $50 million, equitable transit-oriented development (eTOD) project adding 96 mixed-income apartments in the community.   The station provides easy access to CTA buses, space for pedestrians to walk, and bike-sharing options. CDOT announced the installation of the City's 1,000th Divvy station at the Damen Green Line, helping the station serve as a multi-modal facility to provide various sustainable and equitable transportation options for the neighborhood.   The $80 million TIF-funded project was administered by CDOT in close collaboration with the CTA. Designed by Perkins&Will, the project was built by construction contractor F.H. Paschen. Station materials and design elements were chosen and arranged to create an intuitive user experience and to allow for a long-lasting transit facility with low-maintenance requirements. A grand stair and escalator, visible through the transparent glass façade, guide passengers to the platform level. A glass bridge connects the inbound and outbound train platforms, offering spectacular views of the Chicago skyline and orienting visitors to neighborhood destinations and attractions. The bridge's visible structure references Chicago's iconic steel bridges.    The new station also features a large mural by the noted artist, Folayemi Wilson, that highlights the rich history of various ethnic groups on the Near West Side. The mural depicts a scene on the prairie with images of young people taken from local photographic archives peering towards the horizon and imagining their future. Wilson was commissioned for the work by the City’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE). The CTA includes artwork in its new stations to not only further enhance the space, but also create a connection with the surrounding community and inspire those who travel through the facility.    ",Near West Side
Reinsdorf and Wirtz families plan $7 billion redevelopment around United Center,"United Center next-generation owners Michael Reinsdorf and Danny Wirtz have announced plans for a $7 billion catalytic mixed-use development project that includes housing, retail, entertainment and public open space on more than 55 acres of privately owned land surrounding the iconic arena campus. Spearheaded by the Reinsdorf and Wirtz families, The 1901 Project will transform the parking lots surrounding the United Center with new development, bridging neighborhoods and enhancing opportunities for residents, businesses and all of Chicago. “The 1901 Project represents a continuation of our families’ 100-years-and-counting commitment to the future of Chicago’s West Side,” Reinsdorf said. “This investment will create a thriving, interconnected neighborhood, delivering significant benefits and resources to the community we have long called home.” The 1901 Project is a long-term, multi-phased development vision spanning an estimated ten years. The first phase of the project aims to begin in spring 2025 on property that is today surface parking lots adjacent to the arena.  The initial phase will feature a 6,000-seat capacity theater-style music hall. The intimate, premier venue is designed to attract music, arts and cultural events, enhancing Chicago’s entertainment industry. Innovative green space is strategically integrated on the west side of the campus including on top of parking garages, providing more than 25 acres of public recreational and community gathering space. The plan calls for reimagined parking facilities and an improved pedestrian experience with enhanced walkability, lighting, roads and bike lanes uniquely designed to blend into the development. A mix of hospitality and retail options aimed at boosting local commerce and creating jobs have been incorporated into the plan as well. “The vision for The 1901 Project is to bring impactful investment and economic opportunity to the West Side that compliments and supports its rich history and galvanizes its vibrancy,” Wirtz said. “We aim to create a development alongside our neighbors to deliver jobs, housing, commerce and community resources, creating a more prosperous future for all residents.” Future phase development envisions housing that spans various unit sizes and includes affordable, market rate and luxury housing to ensure a vibrant mix of residential offerings for single persons and families.  Transportation enhancements will better connect the neighborhood through multi-modal means including bike, pedestrian, car and rail enhancements.  Immersed in green spaces and sustainability features as well as decorative lighting, pedestrian plazas and landscaping will also aid in community safety and accessibility. All in, the $7B investment is set to deliver substantial economic benefits to the West Side, with an estimated $9.5 billion in direct economic impact and $40 million in stabilized tax revenue, providing significant financial support to local public services and infrastructure. The transformative development is estimated to create approximately 63,000 construction jobs, offering extensive employment opportunities during the development phase. Additionally, upon completion, The 1901 Project will support around 12,000 permanent jobs, fostering long-term economic growth and stability for the community. These investments will not only enhance the economic landscape throughout Chicago but also improve the quality of life for residents long left without such opportunities on Chicago’s West Side.

CTA announces reopening of Forest Park Blue Line tracks,"The Chicago Transit Authority has announced the completion of major track work as part of Phase 1 of the Forest Park Branch Rebuild. Blue Line trains are now running between the O’Hare and Forest Park stations, making all stops for the first since late-July. “Thanks to the coordination and tireless work from across the agency, this line-cut has finished on-time and on-budget— a timely benefit to the entire Blue Line,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “We knew that project work of this scale would be a disruption to our riders, which is why we kept an aggressive pace for the line-cut, working around the clock to resume normal service along our second busiest rail line.” As part of this $268 million project, crews have completely rebuilt almost three miles of track, between the LaSalle and Illinois Medical District (IMD) stations in 11 weeks. Additional work planned as part of Phase 1 project work continues, including the complete reconstruction of the Racine main station entrance and auxiliary entrance, as well as construction of the new Morgan substation. As the work was planned to minimize impact on customers, CTA sequenced the project to complete the trackwork with bus shuttle support and then complete the signal work while trains are running.  As such, trains will run temporarily at a reduced speed between LaSalle and IMD and then gradually increase up to the posted speed.  The full speed restoration is anticipated by the end of this year. Anticipated impacts to Blue Line service are expected in 2024-2025 as the remaining portions of Phase 1 project work is completed. Crews are continuing work to upgrade the traction power system that provides electricity to the system and will result in improved service reliability for the Blue Line. This work entails the construction of a new substation over the right-of-way at Morgan Street, as well as other upgrades being made to power system components in the area. The existing Racine station has already been demolished and crews have begun to rebuild the Racine main station entrance to make it fully accessible to those who use mobility devices. The station house at the main Racine entrance will include a new elevator. In addition to the elevator, a longer platform and new stairs will replace the ramp that once connected the platform to street level at Racine Avenue. The main entrance of the Racine station will remain closed and is expected to re-open in late-2024, at which time the Loomis St. auxiliary entrance will close for reconstruction through 2025. The Loomis St. auxiliary entrance of the Racine station reopened following the completion of track work.  ",Near West Side

Full building permit issued for 921 N. Noble,"A full building permit has been issued for a mixed-use building at 921 N. Noble. Planned as part of the larger St. Boniface redevelopment, the new building will stand on a currently vacant lot directly to the north of the St. Boniface church. With ZSD Corp and Stas Development working on the overall development, zoning documents show the newly permitted building recently underwent a change in scope before the foundation permit was issued. With SPACE Architects + Planners in charge of the design, the mixed-use building will stand four floors, up from just two stories. Rising 46 feet, the building is now set to hold 9 units, up from just 4. Eight of the apartments will occupy the upper floors and will all be affordable. On the ground floor, 1,100 square feet of commercial space will be joined by a live/work unit.  The building will be served with 14 car parking spaces as well as 4 bike parking spaces. The car parking spaces will include 10 spots in the building’s basement, accessed through the basement of the St. Boniface church. The remaining four will be accessed at ground level from the alley.  As part of the overall development, work has begun on the adaptive reuse of the church building at 1356 W. Chestnut. With permits issued for the conversion of the church into 18 condominiums, the exterior will be restored while the interior will be infilled with the residential units. A third building, addressed at 1342 W. Chestnut, will produce a further 20 homes. With permits issued, general contractor ZSD Construction will be able to commence construction on the new four-story building and continue work on the church’s conversion.

Apartments headed to narrow Wicker Park lot,"At the border of Wicker Park and Noble Square, plans are advancing to bring a 14-unit transit-oriented apartment development to a narrow overgrown lot that has sat vacant for 20 years. The upcoming four-story building—called Wicker Park Place—is slated for the corner of Milwaukee and Haddon Avenue. Developed by Mark Sutherland of Wicker Park Apartments and designed by Milbury Architects, the project will contain a small ground-floor retail space, 8 one-bedroom rental units, and 6 studio apartments.  Since the corner site at 1162 N. Milwaukee Avenue is located less than 500 feet from the Division and Ashland Blue Line stop, Wicker Park Place qualifies as a transit-oriented development (TOD). The designation allows the skinny lot to be developed into multiple housing units without off-street parking.  The location is also within the Milwaukee Corridor ARO pilot zone which requires the developer to offer two apartments (15 percent of the total units) at below-market rates. The development will also provide streetscape improvements including new parkway trees and a public bike rack. The Zoning Board of Appeals recently voted to approve a pair of variances (reductions in the rear setback and minimum lot area) for Wicker Park Place. According to the project's website, groundbreaking is scheduled for this summer, and delivery is expected in summer 2022.       ",Noble Square
City Council approves music venue at 1675 N. Elston,"The Chicago City Council has approved plans for a new music and entertainment venue at 1675 N. Elston. Located in the North Branch Industrial Corridor, the property was previously a nightclub that got shut down. The existing two-story masonry building on the site will get rehabbed by developer 1675 Holdings LLC who bought the property in 2018 with the intention of re-envisioning the site as a new venue space. Dubbed The Outset, the new entertainment venue will retain the existing two-story masonry building while enlivening the facade with a new mural. On the street-facing elevation, two new windows and an egress door will puncture the currently solid wall and add some transparency along the street. Visitors will enter the property through the adjacent open space before entering the building from the south. Outside, a large outdoor patio will feature extensive landscaping, a center water feature, a food truck parked along the back of the property, and bathroom facilities for patrons. This outdoor space will be screened from the street with a black steel fence with landscaping in front of it. With a relatively small site for the industrial corridor, no car parking is required, and the plan will not provide any. The developer expects most visitors to arrive via rideshare, public transit, biking, or walking. There will be 17 on-site bike parking spaces and the Elston bike lane will be raised up to the sidewalk level and placed inside of the parking lane to avoid door slams from cars stopping to drop people off. The development will also include the addition of 5 more bikes to the existing Divvy station on W. Wabansia Ave.  With City Council approval, the site will now be rezoned from M3-3 to C2-1 with an overall Planned Development designation. The $2 million development can move forward with permitting and construction, but no timeline is currently known. ",North Branch

Landmarks approve tax incentive for Morton Salt shed redevelopment,"Chicago's iconic Morton Salt shed is one step closer to becoming a mixed-use destination for dining and entertainment after the Commission on Chicago Landmarks unanimously approved a tax break to aid in the property's restoration. Known as a Class L Property Tax Incentive, the measure reduces tax assessments for landmarked buildings over a 12-year period with the caveat that the owner must invest at least half of the value of the property into its rehabilitation. The Morton site was eligible for the incentive after the Chicago City Council voted to make the 4.2-acre riverfront property at 1357 N. Elston Avenue an official Chicago Landmark at last Friday's City Council meeting. Co-developers Blue Star Properties and R2 are currently repositioning the former industrial building into a mixed-use complex comprising new office space, food and beverage offerings, a public riverwalk, and a waterfront performance venue. Chicago architecture firm Lamar Johnson Collaborative is steering the effort to reimagine the existing structure, which was designed by architects Graham, Anderson, Probst & White and completed in 1930. The entire project will cost an estimated $45.7 million, and the developers will receive a $7 million tax abatement during the 12 years of the Class L incentive. After that time, the rehabilitated property is expected to generate an estimated $1.6 million in tax revenue each year, according to data from Landmarks staff. The Class L designation still needs to pass the Chicago City Council for final approval.  The historic truss-roofed warehouse, which is instantly recognized for its oversized “umbrella girl” rooftop logo, ceased official operations in 2015. Morton Salt, however, will once again have a presence at the North Branch site when it opens a new research and development facility at the location.

Developers plan 34-unit North Branch apartment project,"More developers are betting on increased demand for rental housing in Chicago's North Branch Corridor, as the area evolves from an industrial no man's land to a mixed-use neighborhood. At 1838 N. Elston Avenue, a joint venture comprising JAB Real Estate and L2 Properties wants to replace a single-story commercial building with a six-story apartment complex.  Designed by Fitzgerald Associates Architects, the 77-foot-tall building would feature 3,330 square feet of ground-floor retail topped by 34 efficiency, one-, and two-bedroom apartments. The proposal takes advantage of nearby bus routes and the Clybourn Metra station and includes no on-site vehicular parking. It will offer an off-street loading berth, a bike room, and a rooftop amenity level with a resident lounge, fitness room, outdoor terrace, and a dog run. The project site is located just west of the multiphase Lincoln Yards megaproject which will eventually bring 14 million square feet of mixed-use development to the North Branch Corridor. A few blocks to the north, the upcoming Triangle Square project will soon deliver 72 condos and just shy of 400 apartments to the changing area. The developers behind 1838 N. Elston will need the city to approve a Residential Business Planned Development application as well as an Industrial Corridor Map Amendment before construction can begin. The project is listed on the agenda of the upcoming June 17 meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission. If approved, the matter will then head to the zoning committee and full City Council for a final vote.   ",North Branch
Boutique offices takes shape along evolving North Branch Corridor,"Drivers on the Kennedy Expressway may have noticed an unusual Jenga-like building under construction at 1525 N. Elston Avenue.  Developed by Alex Pearsall of Property Adventures Corp. and designed by Filoramo Talsma Architecture, the six-story structure might look like modular apartments, but it is in fact the latest office project to spring up in the rapidly evolving North Branch Corridor.  “I’ve heard people ask ‘what is that building?,’” said Ari Topper, a broker for 1525 N. Elston with Baum Realty Group. “It doesn’t look like the typical office product you’d find in the area.”  Boutique in the truest sense of the word, the office floorplans will range from just 3,000 and 4,000 square feet in size. In addition to eye-catching architecture, the building will also offer views of downtown Chicago and parking for 21 vehicles. Two of the building’s five office floors are already leased up, according to Topper. The development is on track to deliver space to tenants in the late second or early third quarter of this year. The progress at 1525 N. Elston—despite the pandemic—is an encouraging signal in the ongoing transformation of the once-industrial North Branch Corridor, which borders neighborhoods such as Bucktown, Lincoln Park, and Noble Square. A sweeping 2017 rezoning of the area has catalyzed investment in the area. Developments include nearby adaptive reuse projects like the loft offices at 1308 N. Elston and the recently approved plan to repurpose the Morton Salt Shed into an entertainment complex, as well as the massive Lincoln Yards high-rise megadevelopment.  Plans for a $40 million driving range slated for 2501 N.

City Council approves revised mixed-use development at 3950 N. Damen,"The Chicago City Council has approved a mixed-use development at 3950 N. Damen. Located at the intersection of N. Damen Ave, N. Lincoln Ave, and W. Irving Park Rd, the plan includes the surface parking lot and bank building at 3950 N. Damen as well as the five-story Fifth Third bank building at 3959 N. Lincoln.  Planned by Orchard Development Group and Ravine Park Partners, the new development at 3950 N. Damen will rise to 7 stories at the corner of Irving Park & Damen, before dropping down to 6 stories. The building will be set back 5 feet from the sidewalk along Irving Park and 15 feet along Damen to expand pedestrian space and provide a minimum sidewalk width of 12 feet. Recently the redevelopment was revised to keep the existing Fifth-Third Bank drive-thru on the Damen property. Previous proposals covered the entirety of Fifth Third Bank’s parcel on Damen incorporating a drive-thru on the ground floor of the building, but the bank conditioned the sale of this parcel on being able to operate their drive-thru continuously throughout construction. When the developer was unable to identify a financially viable way to fulfill this condition, Fifth Third instead opted to keep the drive-thru as-is and exclude it from the development deal. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the smaller footprint of the building has led to a reduction in unit count from 170 apartments down to 130 rentals, with a unit mix of 5 studios, 99 one-beds, and 26 two-beds. The ground floor will have a total of 54 parking spaces and 130 bike parking spaces. A retail space will be included on the ground floor overlooking the intersection and the residential lobby remains just south of that along N. Damen Ave. At 3959 N. Lincoln, affordable developer Brinshore Development will lead the rehabilitation of the historic bank building. Partnering with Apna Ghar, the entire bank building will become 64 permanent supportive housing units for survivors of gender-based violence. Supportive services in the building will include education planning, financial empowerment, children's programming, counseling, and job skills development. With LBBA on board as the architect, the bank building will get a five-story addition connected to its wings on the south and east that will connect around to enclose a center courtyard. Matching the height of the existing structure, the new facades will be clad in brick veneer with composite and metal panel accents next to the windows.  On the ground floor, retail space will occupy the corner frontage and stretch down N. Lincoln Ave. The residential lobby and management offices will occupy the N. Lincoln Ave frontage within the new addition, with 18 parking spaces behind them. The original banking hall space will be used for resident amenities and support services space. On the second floor, the double-height space of the banking hall will be retained and used for further support services space. The remainder of this floor and all of the upper floors will hold the 64 apartments, broken down into a mix of 14 one-beds, 36 two-beds, and 14 three-beds. A resident amenity deck on the roof will overlook N. Lincoln Ave. With City Council approval secured, the sites will be rezoned into a revised Planned Development.

The upper floors will be home to 170 residential units, split into 52 convertibles or studios, 81 one-beds, and 37 two-beds. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the northern facade at the intersection has been designed with a series of alternating balconies, giving a dynamic expression to the prominent corner. As the massing steps down, the color of brick and metal panel changes to further break up the massing by taking on a multi-building expression.  --- At 3959 N. Lincoln, affordable developer Brinshore Development has come on board and will lead the rehabilitation of the historic bank building. Partnering with Apna Ghar, the entire bank building will become 64 permanent supportive housing units for survivors of gender-based violence. The project will not be a shelter for people actively fleeing violence but will serve survivors who are coming from transitional housing as a step on their way back into market-rate housing as they get back on their feet. Supportive services in the building will include education planning, financial empowerment, children's programming, counseling, and job skills development. With LBBA on board as the architect, the bank building will get a five-story addition connected to its wings on the south and east that will connect around to enclose a center courtyard. Matching the height of the existing structure, the new facades will be clad in brick veneer with composite and metal panel accents next to the windows. While showing respect and deference to the bank building, the addition will reinforce the street walls and improve the pedestrian experience. On the ground floor, 3,130 square feet of retail space will occupy the corner frontage and stretch down N. Lincoln Ave. The residential lobby and management offices will occupy the N. Lincoln Ave frontage within the new addition, with 18 parking spaces behind them. The original banking hall space will be used for resident amenities and support services space. On the second floor, the double-height space of the banking hall will be retained and used for further support services space. The remainder of this floor and all of the upper floors will hold the 64 apartments, broken down into a mix of 14 one-beds, 36 two-beds, and 14 three-beds. A resident amenity deck on the roof will overlook N. Lincoln Ave. The proposed financing of this affordable rehab would be LIHTC equity, soft funding from IHDA and a commercial loan. Brinshore Development will be submitting an application to IHDA in the spring, which will include a request for soft funding as well. At the community meeting, residents questioned how the bank building went from a market rate scheme to an affordable development. Alderman Martin explained that during discussions they asked the developer to go beyond the minimum 20% affordability required by the ARO, which they were amenable to. One of the options was this version to provide housing for a domestic violence organization, which led to conversations with Apna Ghar and ultimately Brinshore Development came into the conversation and took over the building as an all-affordable project.  A neighbor raised concern over the parking counts for the development considering an estimate of two cars per unit. The development team responded that the idea that each unit would have two cars is largely unfounded and that data shows that approximately a quarter of renters have no cars and residents near transit options have less cars. While this isn’t a zero-parking facility, they said their 0.5 ratio is supported by a market study and parking utilization study. Another resident asked why the development was still seven stories tall and thought it was too big and should be a maximum of five stories. Alderman Martin jumped in here to respond that through the continued conversations and feedback there is a split in opinion with some residents preferring upwards of eight stories and others wanting fewer. The architects followed up that the massing and stepping down of the building has been a great urban design solution and is a strategy to respond to height concerns. They also noted that the bank building used to be higher than everything around it when it was built too. When residents expressed concerns around this development setting a precedent for taller buildings in the neighborhood, Alderman Martin chimed in to reassure them that this would not be setting a uniform rule across all the arterials with development interest, and that his office will take each proposal as they come and solicit lots of good feedback. When some neighbors brought up traffic concerns, the development team responded that their traffic study reports that the project will have little, or no impact and the design will actually remove three curb cuts on the site that is currently a drive through and parking lot. Moving the single curb cut down the southernmost end of the site will help minimize its impact on congestion at the intersection.  The meeting wrapped up with a public comment portion that saw a slew of neighbors responding very positively to the development, with just a few giving negative feedback. While saying he is getting closer to making a decision, Alderman Martin said that there isn’t any specific timing on when he will make his final decision about whether to support the development or not and will be continuing to solicit feedback. As a proposed amendment to the Planned Development, the project will need to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council.  ",North Center

Revised details for 3950 N. Damen presented to community,"Developers of 3950 N. Damen and 3959 N. Lincoln recently presented their revised plans to the community.  Located at the intersection of N. Damen Ave, N Lincoln Ave, and W. Irving Park Rd, the plan includes the surface parking lot and bank building at 3950 N. Damen as well as the five-story Fifth Third bank building at 3959 N. Lincoln. Orchard Development Group and Ravine Park Partners are partnering on the project. With a history dating back to December 2020, the Damen site was originally proposed as a new grocery store with a new multifamily building on the Lincoln site. After being rejected, the developers came back to the community with an eight-story building on the Damen site and the rehab of the bank building with an addition. After the community rejected the height, they cut the Damen site down to 7 floors and presented that plan to the Committee on Design. With a configuration that was 7 floors by the intersection and five further south, the Committee on Design suggested they return to a denser building along W. Irving Park Rd. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the project team presented two schemes. The first kept the 7-story volume along W. Irving Park Rd with five floors further south, setting back the top floor to reduce its impact on the street. The second version looked at making the northern portion 8 floors and lowering the southern portion to just four floors.  Rising 82 feet, the 7-and-5-story scheme would deliver 176 residential units, split into 70 junior one-beds and studios, 33 one-beds, and 73 two-beds and three-beds. Fifth Third Bank will occupy 3,500 square feet of the retail space and have an internal drive through accessed via a curb cut on N. Damen Ave. The ground floor will be rounded out with another 1,700 square feet of retail, a fitness center, bike storage, and 73 parking spaces.   Rising 92 feet, the 8-and-4-story scheme would deliver 166 residential units, split into 65 junior one-beds and studios, 33 one-beds, and 68 two-beds and three-beds. Fifth Third Bank will occupy 3,500 square feet of the retail space and have an internal drive through accessed via a curb cut on N. Damen Ave. Similar to the 7-story plan, the ground floor will be rounded out with another 1,700 square feet of retail, a fitness center, bike storage, and 73 parking spaces.  Both of these plans would rehab the bank building with two five-story additions on the wings of that building. Rising 65 feet, the new additions onto 3959 N. Lincoln will result in a total of 92 units, split into 46 one beds and 46 two-beds and three-beds. The ground floor will have 5,000 square feet of retail with 22 parking spots. The development will incorporate 20% units at 60% AMI, while also working with the alderman’s office to pursue city subsidies to increase that percentage. Since Fifth Third Bank owns the site, the developers are required to include the bank in the new building with the drive through, vacating the retail space of the historic bank building and opening it up to new tenants.  The developers expect the approval process to last another six months before spending 18-24 months building the new midrise at 3950 N. Damen. One that is done, Fifth Third Bank will move from their space in 3959 N. Lincoln into the new retail space, allowing the developers to begin work on the historic bank building as a second phase to the project. This second phase will last another year, leading to the overall project taking three to four years. ",North Center

Habitat celebrates milestones at OC Living,"Habitat recently joined Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, local and federal officials, project partners and current residents to commemorate two significant milestones at OC Living, a new mixed-income community in North Lawndale within the $200 million Ogden Commons mixed-use project developed by Habitat, Sinai Chicago, and Alecko Capital. Attendees first gathered to celebrate the grand opening of OC Living, the project’s first residential building. After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, a groundbreaking then took place for OC Living Phase A2, the community’s second residential building.  “This is really about reversing the legacy of disinvestment and that’s the core of our work,” said Mayor Johnson, during his on-site remarks, pointing to the city’s $9 million investment in the upcoming Phase A2 building and 23% of the project’s total development costs being covered by Chicago TIF funds. “My administration believes that every single human need is a human right, especially when it comes to housing. Furthermore, we believe that housing is crucially necessary to achieve safety, equity and vitality. These investments are critical because it’s going to deliver more residential homes for North Lawndale and CHA support for 62 more affordable units.” Located at 1325 S. Washtenaw, the recently completed four-story OC Living building includes 92 units, with a mix of 23 studios, 60 one-bedrooms and nine two-bedroom apartments which 90% of are affordable.  OC Living residents have access to outdoor amenities such as an enclosed rubber-surfaced children’s tot lot with play structures, bike racks, a lighted on-site walking path, landscaped lawn and 110 parking stalls. Indoor building amenities include a package and mail room, management and social services offices, resident lounge, fitness center, bike room and on-site laundry facilities. Resident units are Wi-Fi accessible and cable television-ready, and feature open floor plans, walk-in closets, fully equipped kitchens with energy-efficient all-electric appliances and quartz countertops, FOB access entry doors and programmable digital thermostats. The three-story OC Living Phase A2 at 1312 S. Talman will consist of 75 units with a mix of studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms. 82% of the units will be affordable including 30 available to CHA residents, with the remainder set to be rented at market rate. “Today we celebrate three important investments in North Lawndale that collectively comprise the Ogden Commons complex and represent over $100 million of investment in the area since 2020,” said Habitat Affordable Group’s Jeff Head, vice president of development, who emceed the event. “Bringing this project from concept to reality is a testament to the unique public-private partnership and collective vision where accessible healthcare, diverse housing options and community amenities come together to support a vibrant community.” Just steps away is Ogden Commons’ 45,000-square-foot commercial building that marked Phase 1 of the 10-acre development. Completed in 2021, the three-story commercial building is home to Sinai Chicago’s One Lawndale Community Care and Surgery Center, a Wintrust Bank branch, La Catedral Cafe & Restaurant and Momentum Coffee. The third phase of OC Living residential buildings will consist of townhome and multi-flat units, which will have larger floor plans designed for families. McHugh Construction and Bowa Construction are serving as general contractors for the development, which is being built over multiple phases. OC Living Phase A2 is scheduled to open in late 2025.

4300 W. Roosevelt breaks ground,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot, along with partners from 548 Development and Related Midwest, broke ground recently on 4300 W. Roosevelt, one of the Invest South/West RFP winners. Spanning 21 acres, the North Lawndale site is bounded by Roosevelt Rd, and Kostner, Kildare and Fifth Avenues. Prior to being purchased by the city, the industrial corridor was occupied by a Copenhagen snuff plant and other industrial users before being cleared in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1990s, the site was a source of controversy when several aldermen took bribes to allow illegal dumping of hazardous materials on the land, which created dangerous conditions for nearby residents and led to an FBI probe known as Operation Silver Shovel.  ""I'm thrilled to see this project get underway and deliver job opportunities and community gathering spaces to North Lawndale residents,"" said Mayor Lightfoot. ""Through INVEST South/West, we are creating visible enhancements while providing good paying jobs to communities that have been denied resources for far too long, and this project is no different. Not only will this project revitalize the surrounding community, but it will also strengthen our city’s industrial and innovation sectors.""   The $68 million project will deliver two 181,760 square foot, solar-powered industrial warehouses with more than 50 dock spaces designed by Ware Malcomb. Two 5,000 square foot innovation centers and a public park for community use will occupy the south end of the site, designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative. The innovation centers will maximize opportunities for neighborhood groups to host community meetings and events as well as workforce development programs.  The neighborhood park will adjoin the innovation center buildings and is designed to support activities such as markets, food trucks and pop-up stands. The landscaping plan by Site Design Group aims to reintroduce native biodiversity through replanting historic ground species. The 3-acre green space will offer three distinct public spaces, a circuitous fitness path, and over 300 shade trees throughout the site. In addition, the project will include a three-megawatt rooftop community solar system that will be supported by a West Side training program and power approximately 500 West Side homes. The project is expected to bring 250 temporary jobs and 250 permanent jobs to North Lawndale. City support for the project includes $8 million in Tax Increment Financing assistance and the sale of 21 acres of City-owned land for $1 per lot. General contractors Pepper Construction and GMA Construction Group will build the development, with completion expected for Fall 2024. ",North Lawndale

New developments set to revitalize Ogden Ave corridor,"Developers presented their plans for three developments in the Ogden Avenue corridor in North Lawndale to the local community. Sited within the Department of Planning and Development’s Invest South/West Ogden Avenue corridor, the projects are planned for three separate sites.   -- Lawndale Redefined  Lawndale Redefined is a $31.4 million project by GRE Ventures, Imagine Group, and 548 Development. Planned for an acre of vacant, city-owned and private land at 3400 W. Ogden Ave, the project consists of a five-story mixed-income residential building, an arts and technology center that will be operated by City Colleges of Chicago, and retail space.  Designed by Wight & Company, the venture will produce 60 apartments as well as three for-sale townhomes that will be intended to be prototypes for future infill development. The retail and commercial spaces are expected to host a dine-in restaurant at the corner of W. Ogden Ave and S. Homan Ave, a rooftop bistro, and a small-scale grocer at W. Ogden Ave and S. Trumbull Ave.  An outdoor courtyard will offer space for the community with a splash pad, history trail, and other features for public use. The developers are working to secure financing through IDHA and finalize the funding package by the end of the year. They are aiming to begin construction in Q1 2023. -- Ogden Hotel Originally a submission to the North Lawndale Invest South/West RFP, the Ogden Hotel project is being led by Proxima Management. After they were not selected for the RFP site, the development team worked with DPD to select a new site in the area to build the planned hotel.  The original plan called for an eight-story building with approximately 200 hotel rooms, with ground floor retail and restaurant space. The project would incorporate 220 parking spots and feature a rooftop bar. Now sited at 3536 W. Ogden Ave, the project will be very similar to the RFP proposal. Estimated to cost about $48.8 million, the revised project will adjust to the new site which will end up in a massing that would be potentially mirrored. The property is currently made up of four parcels, with two owned by the city, one owned by Lawndale Christian, and one owned privately. The team is working to acquire the parcels as they move forward with the project. -- Grace Manor Developed by East Lake Management and Grace at Jerusalem CDC, Grace Manor is an affordable housing development at 3401 W. Ogden Ave. Sited along W. Ogden Ave, the property is currently a parking lot for the local 10th District police station.  Planned to hold 65 affordable housing units and ground floor retail space, the six-story building will deliver 46 apartments marketed at 60% AMI, including 22 one-beds and 24 two-bed configurations. The remaining 19 rentals will be fulfilled under the CHA RAD program, offering 9 one-beds and 10 two-bedroom units. Tenant amenities will include a fitness center, laundry, rooftop terrace, package room, computer room, and on-site management. 18 car parking spaces and a bike room will also be provided. Approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in January 2022, the development team expects to wrap up final city approvals this spring and secure financing over the summer. Construction is expected to begin this fall. At the meeting, led by local alderman Michael Scott Jr. (24th ward) and DPD, the alderman indicated that there are more projects coming down the pipeline for North Lawndale and the Invest South/West corridor. While still in the very early stages, Lawndale Christian Development Corporation is planning an all-affordable development, while the North Lawndale Community Coordinating Council is reportedly in the efforts of getting a grocery store to open along the W.

City of Chicago announces winner of Roosevelt/Kostner RFP site,"The City of Chicago has announced the winner of the Invest South/West RFP for the Roosevelt/Kostner site. Chosen out of a set of eight responses, the project site spans 21 acres addressed at 4300 W. Roosevelt Rd in North Lawndale. Developed by 548 Development and Related Midwest, the $38.4 million project will develop a solar-powered 302,000-square-foot industrial complex. Paired with a pair of community centers, the proposal will round out with public open space. The complex’s design comes from a team including Lamar Johnson Collaborative, Ware Malcomb, and Site Design Group. Dubbed Lawndale Innovation Center, the new facility will leverage the location’s strengths for freight and logistics with a pair of industrial structures. The two will include one building spanning 153,460 square feet with 31 dock spaces on the northern portion of the site, and a second building measuring 148,680 square feet with another 31 deck spaces on the southern side of the site. Parking areas for 86 trailers and 417 cars will be included. Planned for the southern edge of the site, the development will include the North Lawndale Innovation Center, providing two buildings for community-based retail, workforce training, and office uses in partnership with local community organizations. An adjoining community park will be included to offer outdoor gathering space for community residents. Currently, the site is bisected by the CSX railroad Altenheim Line, which is under study by DPD to convert it to a recreational trail. This development will provide ample room for the future implementation of the Altenheim Line development recently reviewed by the Committee on Design. Access to the trail would be provided from a passive recreation area on the northern half of the site. The project will likely receive TIF money to pay for environmental remediation expenses and the proposed site purchase price for the property is $1. The TIF assistance and land sale will need approval from the community Development Commission and City Council, with overall approval from the Plan Commission. Construction could begin by late 2022.

Danish Home of Chicago expansion breaks ground,"The Danish Home of Chicago and The Danish Home Foundation recently broke ground on a new addition to their senior living community. The groundbreaking was attended by over 100 donors, residents, and dignitaries, including Ambassador Stig Paolo Piras, the Deputy Chief of Mission for the Embassy of Denmark in Washington D.C., and Consul General Jesper Koks Andersen from the Consulate General of Denmark in Chicago.   “This new addition means a tremendous amount to many, many people: our current residents, our many Danish supporters here and across the country, our neighbors, and those who will benefit from our new spaces once we open our new addition,” said Peter Orum, Capital Campaign and The Danish Home Foundation Chairman.  Ambassador Stig Piras from the Embassy of Denmark in Washington D.C. commented, “Today we are not only laying the foundation for bricks and mortar. We’re also strengthening the ties that have bound Denmark and Chicago for many decades.   Designed by HED, the $13.5 million addition comprises five independent living one-bedroom apartments and nine additional private healthcare suites.  The dining room will be expanded and will showcase floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking magnificent gardens. The kitchen will be upgraded with modern appliances, additional preparation areas, and storage as they fundraise towards the next phase. A new bistro space will be created to encourage casual gathering and entertainment. Also, new gardens and walking paths will be added for residents to enjoy the outdoors. The community has also spruced up the living room, gathering room, and hallways.    This expansion is the fourth since the community was founded in 1891 by 12 Danish women who wanted to ensure that no one from the homeland who was living in the Chicago area would ever have to worry about growing old and being alone. This addition is made possible by the generosity of many groups and people who have generously donated over $8.7 million in cash, pledges, and an additional $3.3 million in bequests. With Berglund Construction serving as the general contractor, construction is expected to be completed in the Spring of 2025.   ",Norwood Park
Fifty new homes proposed for vacant Norwood Park site,"A development of 50 single-family homes is in the works for a vacant roughly 7.5-acre parcel in western Norwood Park on Chicago's far northwest side.

New Terminal 5 Parking Garage opens at O’Hare,"The Chicago Department of Aviation recently celebrated the grand opening of a new, six-story parking garage serving the recently renovated and expanded Terminal 5, the latest milestone in the modernization of O’Hare International Airport. The new parking structure, which will be the first-ever to serve Terminal 5 — more than doubles the amount of available parking at the terminal, which handles both domestic and international passengers. “Investments like this are an important complement to the transformational modernization happening across O’Hare Airport,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “Our goal is to ensure a world-class traveling experience during every step of the journey into, through and out of the airport.” The $191 million garage features a parking guidance system that provides real-time availability of parking spaces, as well as 48 electric vehicle charging stations. It connects to Terminal 5 by way of an enclosed pedestrian bridge on the first level. The garage replaces a portion of the adjacent Lot D surface parking lot and offers both short- and long-term parking options. The adjacent surface lot will still offer about 650 spaces. “With features like real-time parking guidance and electric vehicle charging stations, this new garage reflects our commitment to innovation and sustainability,” said CDA Commissioner Jamie L. Rhee. “It’s an important addition to Terminal 5, ensuring our customers have a convenient and accessible experience from the moment they arrive.” In addition to addressing the need for convenient parking, the garage makes a strong architectural statement. Designed by SCB, its ornamental metal cladding and subtle curves soften the scale of the structure and give it a sense of lightness. With joint venture AECOM Hunt Clayco BOWA leading the construction, the first five levels of the garage are fully open to customers. The rooftop, Level 6, is expected to open later this month. Additional landside improvements will include re-striping of airport roadways to rebalance lane capacity and an expansion of the curbside area, including physical drive lanes, dedicated entry and exit roadways, escalators, and pedestrian areas.

O’Hare redevelopment timeline pushes back to 2034,"The timeline for O’Hare’s extensive $8.5 billion expansion and rebuild has been extended further into 2034. Most recently the redevelopment was expected to be done in 2032, but when the project was originally announced in 2018, construction was supposed to be finished by 2026. The city's original plan called for starting construction with the two satellite concourses and the tunnel that will connect the new concourses to the existing terminal, followed by the O’Hare Global Terminal, the project’s centerpiece. Back in May 2024, Mayor Brandon Johnson and the airlines struck a deal to adjust the timeline, building the first satellite, then the Global Terminal, and the second satellite last.  The first building to begin construction will be Satellite 1, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) in collaboration with Ross Barney Architects, Juan Gabriel Moreno Architects (JGMA), and Arup. Satellite Concourse 1 adds 19 new gates and is designed to flexibly accommodate different sizes of aircraft bodies, increasing operational efficiency for carriers and reducing layover transfers for passengers in one of the nation’s busiest airports.  Work on the project began in March 2023 with the construction of several temporary taxiways and a new grade-separated roadway, the reconfiguration of Taxiway B, and the construction of three new temporary gates off Concourse C, which opened this spring. The current timeline calls for the completion of the Satellite Concourse 1 as an extension of Concourse C in 2028. The project’s timeline shows that the centerpiece O’Hare Global Terminal, which will welcome international travelers and allow them to connect to domestic Terminals 1 and 3, is on track to finish in 2032, with Satellite 2 being pushed back to 2034. ",O'Hare
Renderings emerge for Satellite Concourse 1 as part of O’Hare 21,"Mayor Brandon Johnson and the Chicago Department of Aviation have unveiled the design of Satellite Concourse 1, the first major component of the O’Hare 21 Terminal Area Plan expansion and modernization project. The new concourse, which will serve both international and domestic passengers, is one of the largest components of O’Hare 21, a curb-to-gate transformation of O’Hare’s terminal complex into a modern, efficient global hub designed to create a more efficient and comfortable experience for travelers. “Chicago’s airports play a critical role in the country’s aviation system and our local economy, impacting more than 700,000 jobs across the region and contributing more than $70 billion in economic activity. Investments in our airports are truly investments in our communities, generating new career opportunities for the people and families of Chicago and creating generational wealth among local entrepreneurs,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “Moving on to the next phase of O’Hare expansion has required a full force of government approach, led by my administration, from our federal leaders and legislators to the team at the Chicago Department of Aviation, and I look forward to continuing this work with our airline partners as we build the O’Hare of tomorrow together.” Architectural renderings for Satellite Concourse 1 released by the city showcase a unique design led by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) with Ross Barney Architects, Juan Gabriel Moreno Architects (JGMA), and Arup. ""We designed the new satellite concourse to create a frictionless experience for travelers, on par with the best airports in the world,"" said SOM Design Partner Scott Duncan. ""The gate lounges feature column-free expanses for easy wayfinding, high ceilings to optimize views, and a daylighting strategy to help align the body's natural rhythms — all to make the experience of air travel more pleasurable. We are excited for our team to lead the way on O’Hare 21 and to establish a new standard of excellence for O’Hare."" Satellite Concourse 1 adds 19 new gates and is designed to flexibly accommodate different sizes of aircraft bodies, increasing operational efficiency for carriers and reducing layover transfers for passengers in one of the nation’s busiest airports. Work on the project began in March 2023 with the construction of several temporary taxiways and a new grade-separated roadway, the reconfiguration of Taxiway B, and the construction of three new temporary gates off Concourse C, which opened this spring. Satellite 1 is the first major component of the much larger Terminal Area Plan, which includes as its chief components two new satellite concourses, a new O’Hare Global Terminal replacing Terminal 2, and an underground tunnel connecting the facilities. An agreement with O’Hare’s hub carriers announced by the Johnson administration earlier this month will prioritize design, construction, and delivery of the O’Hare Global Terminal to bring forward its benefits to the traveling public sooner. Design and engineering experts retained by the CDA, and its diverse team of contractors are actively working to progress the design and review the timeline for the O’Hare Global Terminal and Satellite Concourse 2 to meet the terms of this agreement, and the City will share the results of that work over the next six to 12 months. Satellite Concourse 1 and the infrastructure projects associated with the development are anticipated to create more than 3,800 construction jobs. The city selected a joint venture of AECOM, Hunt Construction Group, Clayco, and Bowa Construction to act as the general contractor for the concourse and related infrastructure in February. Work begins this summer on a stormwater project that will support the future elimination of a detention basin west of the future satellite concourse to an expanded basin on the southeast end of the airfield. The current timeline calls for the completion of the Satellite Concourse 1 as an extension of Concourse C in 2028. ",O'Hare
O’Hare expansion moving forward after airlines sign off,"Brandon Johnson and the City of Chicago have announced an agreement with the airline partners to proceed with the Terminal Area Program (TAP) to modernize Chicago O’Hare International Airport.  In a statement the city said, “We are extremely grateful to United Airlines, American Airlines, and other federal, state, and local stakeholders for their valued and trusted partnership. The City looks forward to continued collaboration towards improving the O’Hare experience for millions of travelers and maintaining the airport’s status as an essential global gateway.” To get United Airlines and American Airlines on board and to cut costs, the new proposal by Mayor Johnson would build the new global terminal first and complete the satellite concourses afterwards. While a timeline wasn’t promised by the city, the satellite concourses were promised to still be built as they bring a series of additional gates. Designed by Jeanne Gang of Studio Gang in collaboration with Solomon Cordwell Buenz and Corgan under the name Studio ORD, the global terminal would replace Terminal 2 and would let passengers transfer from domestic to international flights without switching to the current international terminal, Terminal 5. With the approval from the airlines, the project will proceed, albeit on a new undetermined timeline.  ",O'Hare
City and state officials break ground on O’Hare T3 renovations,"Mayor Johnson joined Senator Durbin, Senator Duckworth, Representative Garcia, and the FAA to break ground on the approximately $300 million ElevateT3 project, a massive investment in the airport’s aging terminal facilities supported by $90 million in grant funding from President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).  “Today marks a significant step forward in redefining the travel experience at O'Hare International Airport through the ElevateT3 project,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “This transformative initiative not only boosts our infrastructure but also strengthens Chicago's position as a global aviation leader, thanks to substantial support from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.” “Supported by funding from the Biden-Harris Administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Terminal 3 Improvements will include the latest technology, provide enhanced energy efficiencies and reduced emissions,” said FAA Associate Administrator for Airports, Shannetta R. Griffin, P.E. “This project will have a significant impact on the people who travel in and out of Chicago O’Hare and change the lives of those in the Chicago community as a whole.” ElevateT3 is a key pillar of O’Hare 21, Chicago’s vision to transform the country’s best-connected airport into an efficient and accessible international gateway for the 21st century. The construction work that is now underway will upgrade customer amenities, improve security screening and airport operations, and expand accessibility for passengers with disabilities at Terminal 3. Upgrades include the reconfiguration of two Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints into a single screening area, providing space for modern and more efficient equipment; an expanded passenger corridor between Concourse K and Concourse L, tripling the current corridor’s width; the expansion of the holdroom space at Gates K1 and L2A, dramatically improving the passenger experience; a reconfigured baggage claim area and other upgrades to the terminal's baggage facilities and systems that provide sortation for departing passenger baggage; the development of approximately 10,000 square feet of new concessions and amenity spaces; renovated restrooms and a new family restroom; and renovations of the terminal’s interior and exterior structures and systems, which will improve overall energy efficiency. Part of the $300 million project will be financed by Bipartisan Infrastructure Law through two competitive grant awards announced over the past two years — a 2023 grant valued at $50 million and a 2024 grant totaling $40 million. Each amount was the largest single grant awarded to any airport in America through the Airport Terminal Program over the past two years. The balance of the Terminal 3 upgrade will be paid for by previously allocated federal funds and airline rates and charges. “With today’s official groundbreaking, we’re embarking on a journey towards enhancing the efficiency, safety, and accessibility of one of the busiest airports in the world,” said U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL). “Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, this initiative will not only create thousands of jobs, but it will also bolster our economy and invest in the future success of O’Hare, the state, and the region.” Construction work will be performed by COT3 as Construction Manager At-Risk (CMAR). The company is a joint venture of Clark Construction and W.E. O’Neil. The project is expected to last for just over three years, with an anticipated completion date of summer 2027. Construction will take a phased approach to allow continuous operations throughout Terminal 3 during construction.  ",O'Hare
Lightfoot celebrates completion of Terminal 5 expansion,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) to celebrate the grand opening of the new eastern extension of Terminal 5, a major milestone in the $1.3B, four-year investment to expand and modernize the key gateway at O'Hare International Airport. “O’Hare is a significant economic engine for our entire region and the first impression of Chicago for millions of visitors every year,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “That's why we are especially proud to cut the ribbon to this expanded, modernized Terminal 5, which represents a major milestone in O’Hare’s curb-to-gate transformation into one of the great airports of the 21st century under the O’Hare 21 capital improvement program. Importantly, this project will also build on my administration’s and CDA's ongoing commitment and efforts to create equitable, economic opportunities for Black and Brown residents, businesses, and construction and development firms.”  Designed by HOK and Muller & Muller Ltd, the light-filled redesign of the facilities maintains the integrity of the terminal’s original 1993 design while modernizing it for the 21st century. The vaulted ceilings welcome natural light and offer views across the airfield toward the Chicago skyline. The L-shaped East Concourse extension added 10 new wide-body gates, nine of which utilize multiple aircraft ramp systems, or “MARS gates.” These MARS gates allow the flexibility to accommodate larger, next-generation wide-body aircraft or more traditional narrow-body aircraft. The space it takes to park two wide-body planes can be repurposed as necessary to fit three narrow-body aircrafts.  Ten renovated gates opened in the western wing of Terminal 5 in October 2022 as the new home for Delta Air Lines, which shifted operations from the carrier's long-time home in Terminal 2. Delta's move also included the construction of a new Delta Sky Club, located between Gates M11 and M14, with more than four times the capacity of its former club in Terminal 2. Chicago’s Sky Club is also Delta’s first to feature boarding on select flights from two gates inside the lounge.  The expanded and renovated areas of Terminal 5 will also be home to a wide array of new concessions. Set to open in phases throughout 2023, local offerings will include Butcher and the Burger, Hampton Social, Bar Siena, Sparrow Coffee, and more.  Partnering with the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE), the redesign includes a public art plan that represents the city’s largest single acquisition of works by Chicago artists in 30 years. Commissions are planned across the FIS Arrival Corridor, the Baggage Claim area, and the Passenger Level Concourse.  Work began on the modernization and expansion back in 2019, with construction led by general contractor joint venture Austin Power Partners. The project increased the terminal’s capacity by 25% to improve efficiency and reduce delays. Passenger amenity space was increased by 75%, and the existing building was expanded by approximately 350,000 square feet, with additional renovations to 750,000 square feet of the existing structure.   In June 2022, work also began on a new six-story parking garage for Terminal 5, set to replace the current surface Parking Lot D. Set to complete in 2024, it will more than double the amount of available parking and include short- and long-term parking options. The garage will include parking assist technology and EV charging stations.    ",O'Hare
FAA approves O’Hare expansion plan,"Yesterday Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg joined Mayor Lori Lightfoot to announce the FAA’s approval of the new O’Hare terminal and satellite concourses. Following a thorough environmental review, The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued its findings that there is “no significant impact” to the surrounding environment, emissions should ultimately be decreased by reducing plane taxi times, and the new terminal will not adversely affect the existing historic terminal elements. The FAA decision is a culmination of a required review process that began back in 2018. “O’Hare is the lifeblood of Chicago’s economy, directly employing tens of thousands of Illinois residents and bringing more than 70 million passengers to and through our city each year,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “The next phase of work will expand O'Hare's capacity to serve travelers and improve the customer experience, transforming it into one of the greatest airports of the 21st century.”   The newly announced approval clears the way for new construction to begin. The latest plan calls for the construction of the two satellite concourses and related airfield work to begin first, once the ground thaws this spring. With Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) leading the design work, the first satellite concourse will be completed in 2027 with the second following with completion in 2028. Once opened, these satellite concourses will deliver approximately 1.3 million square feet of gates and amenity space, dramatically expanding the airport’s flexibility to accommodate both narrow and wide-body planes. Opening these facilities first will allow O’Hare to maintain gate capacity while the new global terminal is constructed. “Chicago’s transportation infrastructure is what makes this city an economic powerhouse of global importance,” said Secretary Buttigieg. “Now, as we prepare to break ground on O’Hare’s newest terminal, Chicago and this entire region will be positioned to grow and create good-paying jobs through the benefits of first-rate infrastructure, beginning with the construction project itself.”  Currently O’Hare’s oldest passenger facility, Terminal 2 is slated for demolition in phases after the satellite concourses open. Designed by Studio ORD, the construction of the O’Hare Global Terminal is slated to begin in 2026 with a 2030 completion target. Work on a large tunnel to connect passengers, baggage, and utilities between the O’Hare Global Terminal and the satellite concourses will begin in 2024 with the goal to wrap up by 2030, in line with the main terminal.  When agreed to in 2018, the cost was expected to run $8.5 billion, but 4 years and inflation later, that number has ballooned to roughly $12.1 billion. Upon its opening, the O’Hare Global Terminal will be one of the most significant terminal developments in America, more than doubling the space of the existing Terminal 2 and allowing for the integration of international and domestic operations for the airport’s two hub carriers.

8535 W Higgins approved by City Council,"The City Council followed the Committee on Zoning in approving the rezoning for the residential development at 8535 W. Higgins Road. The property is currently a parking lot for the Marriott Chicago O’Hare hotel, bound to the south by the 12-story hotel and W Higgins Road to the north. Glenstar is the developer behind the venture. Designed by FitzGerald Associates, the development will be a seven-story structure holding 297 residential units. Rising 90 feet, the project will be a three-pronged courtyard-style building with varied exterior cladding including fiber cement board, ribbed metal panels, and face brick.  The $91 million development will produce 59 affordable units on-site, making up 20% of the total units. The affordable apartments will be made up of 17 studios, 24 one-beds, and 18 two-beds.  This approval comes as a rare rebuke of aldermanic prerogative in the city. Typically, aldermen have veto power over proposed rezonings in their ward. Located in the 41st ward, the project has been opposed by Alderman Napolitano for years. The project was originally proposed in 2016 and was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission, only to be denied by the Committee on Zoning at that time at Alderman Napolitano’s request. In the years since, the alderman and a group of community members have continued to oppose the project. Glenstar resubmitted the rezoning and Planned Development application in May 2021. The Committee on Zoning voted to table the project until February 2022, but the developers got it added onto the Chicago Plan Commission meeting in August where it got approved. The Committee on Zoning approved it on Tuesday in a 12-5 vote, forwarding it to the City Council Wednesday. Ultimately, the council approved it in a 33-13 vote, officially granting the project zoning entitlements and rebuking the NW side alderman.  ",O'Hare
Checking in on O'Hare's Terminal 5 expansion ,"It's been two and half years since the Chicago Department of Aviation broke ground on a planned renovation and expansion of Terminal 5 at O'Hare International Airport. The $1.2 billion project is starting to come together, according to aerial photos courtesy of subcontractor FH Paschen. The wedge-shaped addition will span 350,000 square feet and provide 10 new gates to increase the terminal's gate capacity by 25 percent. A further 750,000 square feet within the existing structure is also being remodeled to accommodate expanded security checkpoints, reconfigured immigration and customs, improved baggage handling systems, and space for airline lounges, concessions, and other passenger amenities. Although T5 is primarily currently used by overseas carriers, the renovation will allow it to handle both international and domestic flights. Delta Airlines is expected to make the move to Terminal 5 from its current location at Terminal 2 once the project is complete. Construction should wrap up near the end of 2021 and welcome passengers in 2022.  The Terminal 5 redo is designed by Chicago architecture firm Muller2 in collaboration with HOK and T.Y. Lin International. Construction work is being overseen by the shagadelicly-named Austin Power Partners—a joint venture comprising Austin Commercial, Power Construction Company, and Ujamaa Construction. The renovated T5 is just one piece of the much larger $8.5 billion O'Hare 21 plan to modernize the airport to fit the needs of the 21st century. The crown jewel in the effort will be the eventual construction of the O'Hare Global Terminal—designed by a team lead by Studio Gang Architects—slated to replace Terminal 2. The plan also includes an underground connection to a pair of new satellite terminals designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. ",O'Hare
Apartments near O'Hare moving forward without alderman's support,"Members of the Chicago Plan Commission and Ald. Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward) faced off this week over a proposed 297-unit apartment project near O'Hare International Airport. Disregarding ""aldermanic prerogative,"" the longstanding and unofficial practice of giving city council members the final say on zoning matters within their respective wards, the commission approved the $91 million project against the wishes of Napolitano as well as fellow northwest side Ald. Nick Sposato (38th Ward). Thursday's vote was the second time the Chicago Plan Commission granted developer GlenStar preliminary zoning approval for the project at 8535 W. Higgins Road, which has been under consideration since late 2016. The commissioners signed off on the project in 2017, but the city's Zoning Committee later shot down the proposal at the request of Ald. Napolitano. GlenStar filed—and eventually dropped—a lawsuit against the city. 

 Sposato and Napolitano argued that the project would bring too much density to the vacant site near the Marriott Chicago O’Hare, the Kennedy Expressway, and the CTA Cumberland Blue Line station. The aldermen also raised concerns about school overcrowding (though most of the proposed units will be offered as studios and one-bedrooms).  Napolitano even emailed local residents urging them to speak against the development at Thursday's meeting. However, zero members of the public signed up to voice opposition to Glenstar's plan. Proponents of the project, including Chicago Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox and Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara, pushed back on criticisms and argued that building denser housing near transit is a citywide policy that should be applied independently of ward boundaries, especially in neighborhoods with a deficit of newer mixed-income multifamily housing.  ""Wherever we see effective access to transit, we advocate for higher density housing,"" said Commissioner Cox. ""This project does exactly that. It provides housing choice so that people who work at O'Hare have a shorter commute."" 

 Designed by FitzGerald Associates Architects, the project at 8535 W. Higgins Road has changed little over the past four-plus years. The structure still features an E-shaped layout with two courtyards (though some exterior textured metal and fiber cement panels changed colors). The proposed building will include amenities such as a fitness center and dog run. Although located next to transit, the project is not seeking a reduction in parking or a boost in density under the city's Transit-Oriented Development Ordinance. The development will provide 270 parking spaces as well as ""enhanced pedestrian access"" to the nearby Blue Line stop. The developers will also voluntarily exceed the city's current 10 percent affordable housing rules by providing 20 percent of the apartments (59 units) at below-market rates. The previous version included just seven affordable units.  Before work can begin on the apartment complex at 8535 W. Higgins Road, the project's Planned Development application will need to pass both the Committee on Zoning. Napolitano has already introduced a measure to delay the committee vote.  If the plan manages does manage to get a hearing, it is likely to reignite the debate over aldermanic prerogative versus citywide policy. Stay tuned.  ",O'Hare
Can this luxury Oak Brook rental tower bring 'city vibes' to the burbs?,"It used to be if you wanted to rent in a downtown-quality luxury apartment building you had to live, well, downtown. That could soon change with the arrival of a new 17-story rental tower slated for the former McDonald's corporate campus in suburban Oak Brook. Dubbed One Oak Brook Commons, the Hines-developed property has all the bells and whistles of downtown high-rise... and prices that aren't too far from its urban counterparts. ""It's really about bringing the city vibe out to the suburbs,"" said Aaron Galvin, CEO and founder of Luxury Living Chicago Realty, which is handling the marketing and leasing for the property. ""That's true of the apartments themselves, the amenities, and the service offerings."" All 250 apartments sport high-end contemporary finishes, including quartz countertops, under-cabinet lighting, wide-plank wood flooring, and walk-in closets. A resort-style amenities deck features a heated pool, cabanas, outdoor kitchens, and a lawn. Residents will also have access to a fitness center, club room, library, dog run, and an indoor sports lounge with a golf simulator. At 17-stories, the Antunovich Associates-designed high-rise will provide views back to the city that other rental properties simply cannot match. The building will, however, include a not-so-urban 420 parking spaces in its podium garage. Rents at One Oak Brook Commons will be at the ""very high-end of the suburban market,"" Galvin said. One-bedrooms will rent for $2,395 per month, while two-bedroom units start at $3,395, and three-bedrooms for $4,750. Oak Brook is an affluent enough area to absorb those prices, Galvin insists. Although preleasing doesn't begin until later this year, the project's website has seen ""significant demand"" with hundreds of people signing up for an early-access VIP list, according to Galvin.  ""There was this narrative of a migration out of the city to the suburbs during COVID, and that benefitted the suburban properties,"" Galvin explained. ""Obviously we've seen the city recover in a major way: occupancy is in the 95 percent-plus range and pricing is back to pre-COVID levels. But the suburbs just never took that dip. There's demand that wasn't able to be met during the pandemic. The timing couldn't be better for a project like this."" Initial occupancy of One Oak Brook Commons is expected in early 2022. The tower sits at the center of the larger 16.5-acre Oak Brook Common master development which includes additional offices, condos, hotels, restaurants, and medical uses. There's also a new public park space dubbed ""The Pitch.""  ",Oak Brook
Oak Park cuts ribbon on new recreation center,"Oak Park has cut the ribbon on its new Community Recreation Center, a 42,000-square-foot facility just outside of Chicago. Located at 229 Madison Street, the community building is billed as an anchor for future revitalization in the area. The building, which was designed by Perkins&Will following community surveys and meetings with residents during the course of the pandemic, is a three-story structure composed of brick, metal, and glass. The Community Recreation Center's offerings include a fitness center, an indoor gym, a walking track, and meeting rooms. A central component to the Community Recreation Center is a three-story atrium, which features a bright yellow column which matches the coloring of hallways and walkways throughout the building. A staircase in the building lobby provides vertical circulation for the recreation center, while a bridge at the second floor connects the fitness center to other exercise spaces - and the Community Mental Health Board's offices. The walking track is likewise suspended above the gym with views of the Chicago skyline. “One of the guiding principles of our design approach was conveying the activity and enthusiasm of the building from within,” says Perkins&Will design director for Chicago, Bryan Schabel. “The building is intentionally transparent along Madison Avenue: we made bold and bright color choices – the signature yellow is sure to grab passersby's attention, and you can’t help but ask what is happening in there?  It’s an energetic and vibrant new landmark building for Oak Park.” Besides recreation, the property also includes new offices for the Community Mental Health Board, which provides in-take and referral sources, space for free after-school programs, an e-sports lounge, bathrooms, and locker rooms. Perkins&Will designed the Community Recreation Center to fit on a tight site by pushing programming upward, placing the gym on the second floor. While the building takes advantage of its location along Madison Avenue to the north, it also emphasizes privacy by placing its main corridor along the exterior to buffer spaces for children. However, natural light still streams into the interior through extensive exterior glazing. On the exterior, the building features masonry at the ground floor and metal panels above. Some of that exterior is home to the mural Stories of Our Neighborhood, which shows Oak Park history. ",Oak Park
Seven-story senior living development takes shape in Oak Park ,"A seven-story senior housing development recently topped off in Oak Park. Located about eight miles west of downtown Chicago at 703 Madison Street, the 253,000-square-foot project comes from Michigan-based developer Redico and will feature 177 senior living units offered as studios, one- and two-bedroom apartments as well as shared rooms. Operated by American House Senior Living Communities, the Oak Park project will have 76 independent living apartments, 66 assisted living units, and 35 memory care residences. Amenities include health and wellness care, activity spaces, and both casual and formal dining. There will be a fitness center, a family room for congregating, and a ""landscaped outdoor terrace featuring a memory care walking path,"" according to project designer Myefski Architects. The Oak Park village board approved a zoning change for the development in February 2020. General contractor Clark Construction broke ground in March 2021 and topped off the 168-foot-tall concrete structure in late June. American House Oak Park is expected to open in the summer or fall of 2022. ",Oak Park
Twelve luxury apartments headed to vacant lot in Oakland,"Developer Jennings Realty is close to breaking ground on a four-level, 12-unit luxury apartment project at 4012 S. Ellis Avenue, the company revealed at a virtual meeting hosted by Ald. Sophia King (4th) and the North Kenwood-Oakland Advisory Council (NKOAC).   Designed by Alexander Polichuk Architects, the upcoming project replaces a vacant lot in the Oakland community within Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood. The masonry and limestone structure will contain six one-bedrooms renting for around $1,500 per month and six two-bedroom units starting at $2,000. The largest apartments will be ""duplex-downs"" occupying the first and lower levels.  The plan includes residential balconies on the front and rear of the new building plus a large rooftop deck. Every apartment will have 9-foot ceilings and finishes ""consistent with what is being developed as single-family homes and condominiums,"" said Ivan Mariduena of Jennings Realty. The development team intends to hold the South Side property long-term, according to Mariduena.  The development also calls for a detached, single-story rear garage structure with parking for 12 cars. Some neighbors attending the virtual NKOAC meeting, however, questioned if one space per apartment was adequate off-street parking since half of the proposed residences will have two bedrooms each. The project slated for 4012 S. Ellis is not seeking a zoning change or financial assistance from the city and therefore is not required to provide any below-market-rate units. The developers said they are close to finalizing their architectural drawings and hope to apply for permits and break ground soon. ",Oakland
Four-story apartment project headed to vacant lot on 43rd Street,"It's always encouraging to see vacant land bite the dust for new infill development. And in Bronzeville's Oakland community, an overgrown lot at 920 E. 43rd Street (also known as Muddy Waters Drive around those parts) is about to be replaced by a new four-story mixed-use building. Developed by D.O.M. Properties Investment, the plan consists of 3,800 square feet of street-level commercial space topped by 33 one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments. The project, which was designed by Pro-Plan Architects, also includes parking spread across a ground-floor garage and a surface lot. This project is what is commonly called an ""as of right"" development, meaning it doesn't require any kind of zoning change or financial support from the city. These types of developments often materialize out of public view, but the developer behind  920 E. 43rd Street conducted a courtesy presentation for residents at a virtual meeting on Thursday hosted by Ald.

Dermatology, endocrinology and gynecology will be added in 2024. “Patients are now able to receive primary and specialty care in Old Irving Park, close to where they live and work,” said Leonardo Vargas, MD, medical director of the Northwestern Medicine Old Irving Park Outpatient Center. “We’re delighted to provide the services patients need within their community and to create jobs in the Old Irving Park area.” Designed by CannonDesign, the 160,000-square-foot-building also features on-site parking with 350 spaces and a sustainable design with eight electric vehicle charging stations, three green roofs and low-emitting materials used throughout the building. Power Construction served as the general contractor. ",Old Irving Park
Northwestern Medicine coming to Old Irving Park,"Construction permits have been issued for an upcoming medical office building run by Northwestern Medicine. Located at 4445 W. Irving Park Rd, the project will span the full block from N Kenneth Avenue to N Kilbourn Avenue.  With a design from CannonDesign, the project will build a four-story medical center. The building’s design will employ an articulation of edges and carving of the volume to line up the building with prominent datums in the nearby community. The design of the front facade will be separated into three segments, with one section for the entrance that brings in light through a glass facade that brightens the space, a center section that is more solid and holds the Northwestern logo, and a final section that screens the parking garage ramps. 350 parking spaces will be provided within the building. At the corner of W. Irving Park Rd and N. Kenneth Ave, the main entry will be setback from the street and feature an outdoor plaza. Measuring 2,400 square feet, the plaza will include seating, bike racks, and greenery. A 24,000 square feet green roof will top the building. To meet sustainability requirements, the project will achieve LEED Silver status, include EV charging stations, reduce light spill, use low-emitting materials, complete 80 percent construction waste diversion, and use bird-friendly glass with a low-e coating. The site went through a rezoning process from B3-1 and RS-2 to a consistent B3-3 in April 2021. Expected to cost $150 million, the construction of the project will be led by Power Construction. Groundbreaking was originally expected for Fall 2021 but is now likely to begin in the New Year. A permit for the tower crane was also issued at the end of October. ",Old Irving Park
ZBA approves variances for mixed-use development at 1559 N. Wells,"The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a set of variations for a mixed-use development at 1559 N. Wells. Currently occupied by a one-story retail building, the project site is located along N. Wells St just south of W. North Ave. Benjamin Pourkhalili, the owner of Galleria Liquors, is behind the development and plans to bring back the store within the new development’s retail space. Designed by Virgil James Inc, the new development will be a five-story mixed-use building. On the ground floor, the retail space will occupy most of the footprint with a residential lobby reaching the N. Wells St frontage. A single parking space will be located at the back of the building.   On the upper floors there will be two residential units per floor for a total of eight dwelling units. Each unit will have two bedrooms and two baths as well as outdoor balconies facing either N. Wells St or the alley. The Zoning Board of Appeals approved a variation to reduce the rear setback from the required 30 feet to zero, a variation to increase the building from the maximum height of 50 feet to 53'-8"", and a variation to reduce the parking from eight spaces to one space. With the variances approved by the ZBA, the developer can continue with permitting and construction. A full building permit is currently under review and a demo permit has yet to be filed. ",Old Town
Fern Hill submits zoning application for Old Town Canvas,"Fern Hill has officially submitted their rezoning application for Old Town Canvas, their proposed mixed-use development at 1600 N. LaSalle. First revealed in September 2023, the project site is bounded by N. Wells St to the west, W. North Ave to the south, and N. LaSalle Dr to the east. Walgreens and a surface parking lot for Moody Church currently occupy the site. Designed by GREC Architects, the originally planned scheme was for a 36-story mixed-use tower with 500 rental units as well as retail on the ground floor, including a new space for Walgreens. The building would include 300 parking spaces dedicated to Moody Church and 150 parking spaces for residents, as well as 500 bike parking spaces. The 395-foot-tall tower would include 100, or 20%, residential units set aside as affordable at or below 60% AMI.  In response to continued community feedback, Fern Hill has decided to increase the setback from N. Wells St to a total of 42 feet, thinning the tower to preserve more views for nearby residents and maintain the character of N. Wells St. After seeking feedback on design options for the N. Wells St podium, GREC Architects is using the townhome tapestry version as a baseline for the revised facade and podium frontage on this corner.  While they originally planned to stay within the 400-foot datum for the area, the volume removed from the additional setback was added onto the top of the building, increasing the height to 494 feet. Fern Hill described in a recent community meeting that this height increase actually comes at a cost of an additional $5 million as each floor becomes smaller and less efficient, meaning that each floor has a ratio of less rentable square footage to offset the cost of stairs and elevators that take up space on each floor. With the zoning application officially filed, the zoning process can begin with the developer consulting with multiple city departments. The plan would combine the Piper’s Alley building, Walgreens building, Moody Church parking lot, the BP and Shell gas stations, and Moody Church itself into one large Planned Development. With 4.5 acres of space, the properties would all be rezoned to a unified B3-5 with the density combined onto the Walgreens and Moody Church parking lot portion. The proposed zoning designation is the same as Americana Towers and 1660 N. LaSalle and 17% less dense than Eugenie Terrace. While some neighbors still expressed concerns over the project, Fern Hill said they are still working through details including traffic concerns and mentioned that they will start working with CDOT to revise it and are doing a traffic study. Alderman Hopkins has yet to express his opinion on the proposal. ",Old Town
ZBA approves variances for development at 1421 N. Sedgwick,"The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a set of variances for a residential development at 1421 N. Sedgwick. Located midblock between W. Blackhawk St and W. Schiller St, the project site is currently vacant and landlocked without access to an alley at the back of the property. Leo Razko of Razko Development is the developer behind the proposal. With MC & Associates serving as the architect, the development will consist of a six-story masonry structure topping out at approximately 75 feet tall. The building will have three residential units on the ground floor with nine parking spaces in the basement, accessed via a curb cut on N. Sedgwick St. The upper five floors will have four two-bedroom condos each, with private balconies on the front and rear elevations. With a total of 23 condominiums, the developer expects to sell 18 of them for $385,000 each. The remaining five will be sold as affordable homes for approximately $220,000 through the Chicago Housing Trust.  With approval secured from the ZBA, the development will get a variation to reduce the rear setback on floors containing dwelling units from the required 30 feet down to 6.92 feet. An additional variation will allow the elimination of the one required 10' x 25' loading berth. The developer can now move forward with the approximately $4.5 million development.

Demo permit issued to make way for hotel at 1528 N. Wells,"A demolition permit has been issued to demolish an existing three-story structure at 1520 N. Wells. Clearing the way for the long-awaited hotel development at 1528 N. Wells, the project was originally approved back in September 2020. Planned by Condor Partners, the project will occupy a currently vacant site midblock along N. Wells St.  Designed by Pappageorge Haymes, the project will see the construction of a 12-story hotel tower. Rising 151 feet, the boutique hotel will include 203 rooms with interiors designed by Summer Thornton. The building has been designed with a classic masonry exterior punctured by 8-foot-tall windows, with outdoor terraces on top of the massing’s multiple setbacks. Three levels of parking will rise at the back of the site, with access via a curb cut on N. Wells St.  Dubbed The Duke of Wells, hotel guests will have access to 4.5-star amenities including a rooftop lounge with expansive views of Chicago and Lake Michigan, a spa, a fitness center, and a world-class restaurant.  As part of the development, two large single-family homes will be built along N. Wieland St to screen the parking structure that will stand behind the hotel tower. Oriented north/south to act as the screens, the homes will render the parking nearly invisible from sight while creating new homes to close the gap along N. Wieland St.  While the project has been largely quiet since its approval, a foundation permit was issued in October 2022 with McHugh Construction listed as the general contractor. With the demolition permit issued, demolition contractor National Wrecking Company can clear the three-story structure at 1520 N. Wells from the site.  ",Old Town
1600 N. LaSalle faces fierce opposition from neighbors,"Residents reacted to a revised design for the mixed-use development at 1600 N. LaSalle at a virtual community meeting last night.

Walgreens and a surface parking lot for Moody Church currently occupy the site. Initially revealed in September 2023, the new mixed-use tower will rise 36 stories to a height of 395 feet. The building will have a total of 500 rental units, with 100 of them, or 20%, set aside as affordable at or below 60% AMI.  Designed by GREC Architects, the team has incorporated feedback from the community in its updated design. The tower’s facade has been altered to incorporate a warmer, more traditional color scheme that better fits the context, and the base has been updated with a more cohesive, brick base to integrate it into the context.  At the corner of N. LaSalle Dr and W. North Ave, the parking podium for Moody Church has been refined with better proportions and will bring more life to the pedestrian experience. The residential entrance has been shifted over out from under the tower and will add to the activated frontage on W. North Ave, stepping back to increase the depth of the sidewalk and include landscape planters.   At the corner of N. Wells St and W. North Ave, the podium facade has been updated after a community input period that showed a series of options. The scale and brick modulation has been designed to be compatible with the surrounding buildings and the lamps from Walgreens are planned to be reinstalled on the facade. With 450 parking spaces planned for the building, 300 of them would be dedicated for Moody Church’s exclusive use. The remaining 150 spaces would be dedicated to the residents of the building. A porte cochere for drop-off and pickup will be accessed from N. LaSalle Dr and will include access to the parking garage and loading docks. Walgreens will have a dedicated loading berth midblock along W. North Ave.  The development team reviewed the proposed zoning process for the development. The scheme would combine the Piper’s Alley building, Walgreens building, Moody Church parking lot, the BP and Shell gas stations, and Moody Church itself into one large Planned Development. With 4.5 acres of space, the properties would be rezoned to B3-5 with the density combined onto the Walgreens and Moody Church parking lot portion. The proposed zoning designation is the same as Americana Towers and 1660 N. LaSalle and 17% less dense than Eugenie Terrace. The team discussed how the tower height is consistent with its neighbors and walked through a series of massing options that showed taller, thinner options or shorter, wider options. The developer discussed how their proposal is optimized to be taller and thinner to minimize impacts on views from the surrounding buildings while staying with the context of nearby towers.  In a marathon meeting lasting over three and a half hours, numerous community members spoke one after another, voicing their opinions. While some neighbors expressed support for the extra housing and vibrancy, the opposition drastically outweighed the support. Residents lamented the potential increase in traffic in an already heavily congested area, strongly opposed the density and height of the building, and accused the developer of trying to destroy the neighborhood's character.  Alderman Hopkins closed the meeting by citing the fact that there are very good reasons to both support or oppose the project and he must make the decision while weighing the interests of the neighbors and the city at large in mind. Hopkins continued by saying that Chicago is a world class city with its reputation at stake and it needs to continue to grow and improve its vibrancy while attracting investment. While Hopkins said his decision is forthcoming, he said Fern Hill has more work to do to resolve traffic concerns and prove its community benefit before moving forward. ",Old Town
Commissary Market will take over Treasure Island space in Old Town,"Developer Fern Hill recently announced that they have struck a deal with 1350 Commissary Market to give them a new home in the former Treasure Island retail space just north of their proposed 36-story mixed-use development that is currently under consideration by the community and Alderman Hopkins. As they continue to identify a larger tenant for the Treasure Island parcel on Wells St., the Old Town Commissary Market will be a co-tenant with Walgreens, which will temporarily relocate to a portion of the existing retail space while its new flagship location is constructed. For 45 years, the family-owned and operated market served as a convenient grocery store and offered a mix of upscale and everyday offerings to customers. The Old Town Commissary Market will be larger than the previous Gold Coast location and will bring much needed offerings to the neighborhood, including an expanded selection of groceries, a full-scale deli with home cooked meals, and other necessities.  Through the agreement, the Old Town Commissary Market will operate in the Treasure Island space with the option to move into a new retail location at the base of the proposed residential building as soon as a larger tenant is identified.   Designed by GREC Architects, the proposed larger mixed-use tower at 1600 N. LaSalle will rise 36 stories to a height of 395 feet. The building is proposed to have a total of 500 rental units, with 100 of them, or 20%, set aside as affordable at or below 60% AMI.  At the ground floor, Walgreens will occupy 14,000 square feet of new retail space at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Wells St. Another retail space will occupy the opposite corner at W. North Ave and N. LaSalle Dr. The residential lobby will be located in the center of the project’s street frontage along W. North Ave. The north end of the N. LaSalle Dr frontage will have a single vehicular access point for residential parking, parking for Moody Church, and loading access. There will be 150 parking spaces for the residential units and 300 dedicated exclusively for Moody Church. The larger development is still under consideration by the community and Alderman Hopkins and will need a series of approval from the City to move forward. ",Old Town
Fern Hill seeks feedback on 1600 N. LaSalle,"Fern Hill and GREC Architects are seeking feedback from the community regarding a series of design options for the podium facade of their latest development planned at 1600 N. LaSalle. Currently occupied by the existing Walgreens store and a surface parking lot, the project site is bounded by N. Wells St to the west, W. North Ave to the south, and N. LaSalle Dr to the east. Announced at the end of September, the development will comprise of a mixed-use tower that will rise 36 stories to a height of 395 feet. The building will have a total of 500 rental units, with 100 of them, or 20%, set aside as affordable at or below 60% AMI.  At the ground floor, Walgreens will be right sizing their space and will occupy 14,000 square feet of new retail space at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Wells St. Another retail space will occupy the opposite corner at W. North Ave and N. LaSalle Dr. The residential lobby will be located in the center of the project’s street frontage along W. North Ave. The north end of the N. LaSalle Dr frontage will have a single vehicular access point for residential parking, parking for Moody Church, and loading access. There will be 150 parking spaces for the residential units and 300 dedicated exclusively for Moody Church. The tower has been designed to fit into its context, with podium buildings that reference the surrounding heights and are finished in a facade treatment that is inspired by the vocabulary of surrounding buildings. Rather than the solid brick facade that exists currently, the new ground floor facade will be highly transparent to activate the pedestrian experience and bring a sense of safety to the area.  As part of the design process, GREC Architects has studied a number of directions for the portion of the building fronting Wells Street. The below options represent potential design directions for the Well St. podium facade. Neighbors and those interested can share feedback on the design options on Fern Hill’s community engagement website.  ",Old Town
Fern Hill reveals 395-foot-tall tower at 1600 N. LaSalle,"Fern Hill revealed their proposal for a mixed-use development at 1600 N. LaSalle last night at a 2nd Ward community meeting. After initially announcing their plans back in October 2021, the developers returned in February to detail their takeaways from their community engagement in the form of a development framework.  Split into two zones, the developer identified the parcel framed by N. LaSalle Dr, N. Clark St, and W. North Ave as the cultural triangle, whose gas stations would only be redeveloped with structures matching the 50-foot datum of the Moody Church. With the Moody Church parking lot and Walgreens property under consideration to the west of N. LaSalle Dr, Fern Hill will be focusing the density of the project onto this parcel. Designed by GREC Architects, the new mixed-use tower will rise 36 stories to a height of 395 feet. The building will have a total of 500 rental units, with 100 of them, or 20%, set aside as affordable at or below 60% AMI.  At the ground floor, Walgreens will be right sizing their space and will occupy 14,000 square feet of new retail space at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Wells St. Another retail space will occupy the opposite corner at W. North Ave and N. LaSalle Dr. The residential lobby will be located in the center of the project’s street frontage along W. North Ave. The north end of the N. LaSalle Dr frontage will have a single vehicular access point for residential parking, parking for Moody Church, and loading access. There will be 150 parking spaces for the residential units and 300 dedicated exclusively for Moody Church. The tower has been designed to fit into its context, with podium buildings that reference the surrounding heights and are finished in a facade treatment that is inspired by the vocabulary of surrounding buildings. Rather than the solid brick facade that exists currently, the new ground floor facade will be highly transparent to activate the pedestrian experience and bring a sense of safety to the area.  Rising as a rectangular tower intersecting with the contextual base, the residential volume has been designed with inspiration from the modernist lakefront towers, activated with the concept of building as painting. Using the abstraction of a sunrise on the lakefront as inspiration, color is added to the building’s facade to make it unique and memorable.  Fern Hill also addressed the future of the Treasure Island retail space, telling community members that they have been actively searching for a new grocery tenant and have no interest in keeping the space vacant. Despite their efforts, they have been unable to sign a tenant up to this point, but referenced the fact that potential grocers were listening to the community meeting and are likely waiting to see the result of this community process to see if more density and activity would be coming to this area. When asked about next steps, the development team said that there is no specific timeline and that they are expecting conversations around the proposal to continue with the community, Alderman Hopkins, and city department staff. While not specifically discussed, the project will likely need a rezoning and possible Planned Development designation to be able to move forward with construction if approved by Alderman Hopkins.

Alderman Hopkins denies zoning change for 1542 N. Wells,"After hosting a community meeting in June, Alderman Hopkins has announced his decision to deny the zoning change proposed at 1542 N. Wells. Fronting N. Wells St, the project site is a 50-foot-wide lot with no alley access. Proposed by Zach Waickman of GLP, the site is currently occupied by a one-story building and a two-story building. With UrbanWorks in charge of the design, the five-story building was designed to fit into the neighborhood character, sporting a dark gray brick facade, topped with a dark metal cornice and articulated with a dark stone base. Punched windows openings interrupted the masonry on the upper residential floors, while a glass storefront system enclosed the ground-floor retail space. A line of balconies was inset into the street-facing facade for select units in the building. The preliminary design called for 16 residential units on the upper floors, with four rental apartments per level. The unit mix consisted of 8 one-bedrooms measuring 675 square feet and 8 two-bedrooms measuring 900 square feet. The four two-bedroom units facing the street would have had the select units with balconies. With the structure topping out at 50 feet tall, no roof access would be provided for any of the apartments. On the ground floor, the residential entry was planned for the north end of the street frontage, with trash and recycling access at the south side of the frontage due to the lack of alley access. Due to the tight nature of the site and lack of alley access, the building would have had no car parking, but included bike parking for residents.  The remainder of the ground floor was set to provide 2,175 square feet of retail space planned as a cannabis dispensary. As a highly regulated retail tenant, the space would have been designed to have a security lobby at the front where patrons would have to show proof of age before being allowed to enter a second room which houses the sales floor for the dispensary.  After the community meeting, the Old Town Residents and Merchants Association conducted a community survey which yielded over 200 responses. Approximately 25% were in favor, 70% were opposed, and the remaining 5% were neutral. Between the survey results and numerous comments received, Alderman Hopkins decided to deny the request to change the zoning from B3-5 to C1-5. ",Old Town
Eugenie Lane Apartments get final landmark recommendation,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the Eugenie Lane Apartments. Located at 235 W. Eugenie, the rental residences were built in 1962 with a design from Ben Weese.  The building meets Criterion 1 for heritage as it reflects the architectural heritage of Old Town in the 1960s and 1970s, when the neighborhood established itself as a place for artists and the creative community. During the 1960s and 1970s, Chicago architects of the modern era like Ben Weese designed small-scale residential infill buildings in the historic 19th century neighborhood adding an important layer to its built environment. Meeting Criterion 4 for exemplary architecture, the modern-era building has a clear expression of its residential function, absence of ornament, and large windows. The design of the building references architectural elements from the 19th century neighborhood in which it stands including its Chicago common brick walls, louvered accents and standing-seam metal mansard roof. Built at a time when new apartments tended to be in tall towers, the design of the Eugenie Lane Apartments settles for tree-top height and a more human scale. The final criterion the project meets is Criterion 5 for being a work of a significant architect. Ben Weese designed the Eugenie Lane Apartments toward the beginning of a long and rich career in architecture. Though the building may be considered one the architect’s early works, the design of Eugenie Lane Apartments reflects principles that Ben Weese would hone throughout his career including the preference for simple, vernacular materials; responding to context, and a willingness to borrow from history while designing in a modern idiom. Ben Weese was a member of the Chicago Seven, a group of young Chicago architects that formed in the 1970s to educate the public about a more pluralistic view of Chicago’s architecture and to explore new directions at an inflection point in American architecture at the end of the modern movement.  Meeting the Integrity Criterion, the Eugenie Lane Apartments retains more than sufficient historic integrity to express its historic and architectural value to the City of Chicago. It remains in its original location and the residential setting around the building has changed little since the building was constructed in 1962. Changes to the exterior include the recent repair of louvered ventilation panels to match the original. Based on its evaluation of the Eugenie Lane Apartments, the Commission staff recommends that the significant features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building. With the final landmark recommendation approved by the commission, the proposed designation will head to City Hall to get votes from the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council. If approved, the building will officially be shielded from demolition. ",Old Town
CHA submits zoning application for 1401 N. Clybourn,"The Chicago Housing Authority has submitted a rezoning application for its long-vacant site which was once home to the former Cabrini-Green housing project. Planned for a wedge-shaped lot, the site is bound by N. Clybourn Ave to the south, N. Larrabee St to the east, and rededicated N. Ogden Ave and W. Blackhawk St to the west and north respectively. The multi-phase venture is being developed by CHA in collaboration with Hunt Development Group, Pennrose, Imagine Group, and a Cabrini-Green residents group. With JGMA on board for the design, the project documents show a multi-phase, mixed-use development that will occupy the entire site. Once fully built out, the project will deliver 742 residential units and 22,000 square feet of retail space spread across multiple buildings with 174 surface parking spaces organized on the site between buildings. The first phase, Subarea C, will deliver 345 units in two buildings, while Subarea B is planned for 216 units and Subarea D will bring 181 dwelling units. Designed as a cohesive group of buildings, each structure will feature rounded corners and bent-shaped forms. Facades will be clad in metal panels with integral standing seams and window wall glazing. Integrated balconies will be set into the facade of the buildings. With varying heights, Phase 1 will have a 10-story building standing 98 feet tall and an eight-story midrise rising 79 feet tall. While CHA typically builds mixed-income projects, the zoning application doesn’t specify an exact breakdown of unit types or income levels. Due to the fact that they will be funding the project with LIHTC equity, TIF funding, and other revenue streams, the affordable percentage will be higher than the typical ARO requirements because these funding sources require a higher percentage of affordable units. CHA and its team are looking to rezone the site from its existing Planned Development and RT-4 designation to a unified C1-3 before implementing a new Planned Development. The plan will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. Further hearings on the approval of financing can also be expected. ",Old Town

Developer plans mixed-use development at 1542 N. Wells,"A mixed-use development has been proposed at 1542 N. Wells. Fronting N. Wells St, the project site is a 50-foot-wide lot with no alley access. Currently occupied by a one-story building and a two-story building, the property would be cleared to make way for the new construction. Zach Waickman of GLP is the developer behind the proposal. With UrbanWorks in charge of the architecture, the five-story building has been designed to fit into the neighborhood character, sporting a dark gray brick facade, topped with a dark metal cornice and articulated with a dark stone base. Punched windows openings will interrupt the masonry on the upper residential floors, while a glass storefront system will enclose the ground-floor retail space. A line of balconies will be inset into the street-facing facade for select units in the building.

On the ground floor, the residential entry will be at the north end of the street frontage, with trash and recycling access at the south side of the frontage due to the lack of alley access. Due to the tight nature of the site and lack of alley access, the building will have no car parking, but will include bike parking for residents.  The remainder of the ground floor will provide 2,175 square feet of retail space that is currently planned to house a cannabis dispensary. As a highly regulated retail tenant, the space would be designed to have a security lobby at the front where patrons would have to show proof of age before being allowed to enter a second room which houses the sales floor for the dispensary. The developer reassured community members that they would be following all state laws that govern dispensaries which include a highly detailed security plan that involves private security being on-site during business hours. The developer is seeking to rezone the site from B3-5 to C1-5, due to the fact that cannabis dispensaries are not a permitted use in the B- zoning districts. The rezoning would need approval from the alderman, Committee on Zoning, and City Council before the project could move forward. Beyond the rezoning, cannabis dispensaries also require a hearing before and an approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals to operate, at which time the developer and their future dispensary operator would resolve the details of running the dispensary. At this preliminary stage of the proposal, a specific timeline for approvals and construction could not be outlined by the developer. ",Old Town
Full building permit issued for 1505 N. Sedgwick,"A full building permit has been issued for a mixed-use development at 1505 N. Sedgwick. Located on a midblock site, the narrow property is located within a two-minute walk of the Sedgwick Brown Line stop. Developed by 1507 N Sedgwick LLC, a demolition permit issued in May paved the way to clear the way for the new construction.  Designed by Hanna Architects, the new building will stand four floors high, with 4 residential units and 800 square feet of office space that will front the street. The four residential units will include one three-bed duplex down at the back of the ground floor, while the remaining three residential units will occupy one floor each, all of them 3-bedroom configurations. 12 bike parking spaces will be located along the alley. The project received a series of approvals from the Zoning Board of Appeals in February, including a special use to allow for residential use below the second floor, a variation to reduce the rear setback from 30 feet down to 6 feet, and a variation to reduce the required parking spaces from four to zero as the site is a transit-served location. With the full building permit issued, general contractor 5 Seasons Development Company can begin work on the building. A timeline for completion is currently unknown. ",Old Town
City Council approves landmarking of Netsch House,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation of the Netsch House. Located at 1700 N. Hudson, the home was built by Walter Netsch in 1974 for him and his wife Dawn Clark Netsch. The home sits within the Old Town Triangle Historic District although it is currently not listed as a contributing building.  Meeting Criterion 1 for the home’s heritage, the Netsch House was part of a collection of houses built by architects in the 1970s, attracted by the area’s rich cultural context. Established in 1947, the Old Town Triangle Association, which is still active today, supported the artistic character of the neighborhood with its annual art fair. In 1958, the Chicago Tribune called Old Town Triangle Chicago’s Left Bank. The second criterion the house meets is Criterion 3, for its association with a significant person. Dawn Clark Netsch, the wife of Walter Netsch, lived from 1926 until 2013. She studied politics and law at Northwestern University and was the only and first woman to graduate in her class of 1952. She became the first female faculty there and in 1969 was elected to the Illinois Constitutional Convention. In 1973, she was the first woman elected to the Illinois State Senate and spent 18 years in office. In 1994, she was the first woman to run for governor, although she did not win.  The house also meets Criterion 4 for its status as a piece of exemplary architecture. Designed by Walter Netsch, the home is a clear expression of his own Field Theory. The exterior is restrained, while the interior exhibits the drama of the design. The interior is essentially a 30-foot-tall cube with living spaces arranged as platforms that radiate and spiral up from a center core. The vaulted roof is made up of a frame structure of overlaid squares.  The final criterion is Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect. Walter Netsch was born and raised in South Shore and received his architectural degree from MIT in 1943. After serving in World War 2, he returned and joined SOM in 1947 where he spent his entire career. Netsch quickly moved up within the firm and was put in charge of high profile projects, establishing a reputation as a skilled planner for large, complex projects. He later developed his philosophy of Field Theory, which was a process of using overlaid grids to produce lattices that were the beginnings of floor plans and elevations. The most complete expression is his master plan at the University of Illinois Chicago and specifically the Behavioral Sciences Building which clearly shows the lattice form and plan arrangement.  The house also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. Walter and Dawn Clark Netsch lived in the home their entire lives and was only passed to new owners after Dawn Clark Netsch died in 2013. During their time in the house, the Netsch's added a bay window to the south elevation. More recently, the new owners hired SOM to do a careful restoration and renovation to the house, protecting the design while updating the finishes. The significant features set to be protected include all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as parts of the interior. Those include the overall spatial volume of the home as well as aspects of Field Theory and materials that are significant including the central tower and arrangement of living spaces.  With the final landmark designation approved, the home is officially a landmark and is protected from demolition both on the exterior and interior.

Fern Hill presents development outline for North + LaSalle,"Developer Fern Hill presented an outline of their development surrounding the corner of W. North Ave and N. LaSalle St. After initially announcing their plans back in October 2021, the developers returned to detail their takeaways from over a year of community engagement via multiple meetings and their website https://www.engagefernhill.com/.  After the extensive community engagement process, Fern Hill has identified eight common themes:   Anchored by Moody Church, the Chicago History Museum, and the Latin School of Chicago, Fern Hill identified this area as the Cultural Triangle. It’s currently challenged by the surrounding auto-dominated streets and gas stations at key corners, creating a hostile space for pedestrians. Additionally, area institutions currently deal with congested drop-off and delivery operations.  To improve the area, the project proposes a road diet along N. Clark St between N. LaSalle Dr and W. North Ave. Wider sidewalks will encourage pedestrian use, while the narrower street will calm traffic and promote biking. The plan would rework the drop-off and delivery strategies to improve operations for area institutions and neighbors.  To develop the Cultural Triangle, Fern Hill proposed limiting any new construction to a contextual height limit that matches Moody Church. While they don’t own the Wintrust property, Fern Hill believes any kind of high rise would not be the appropriate response for this site.  Considered the Old Town Triangle, this second portion includes the parking lot at W. North Ave and N. LaSalle St and the Treasure Island retail space. With the empty Treasure Island space, Fern Hill is actively working to get a grocer back into the space. They are currently in conversation with a few brands, but they have not been able to close a deal yet due to the challenging physical structure, which is owned by the 1660 N. LaSalle Condo Association.  Planning a unified development, Fern Hill has planned to consolidate the new development to the parking lot at the northwest corner of W. North Ave and N.

Preliminary landmark approved for St. Adalbert Parish Complex,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark designation for the St. Adalbert Parish Complex in Pilsen. Occupying half of a city block, the church complex is bound by W. 16th St to the north, S. Paulina St to the west, and W. 17th St to the south.  Made up of the St. Adalbert Church, St. Adalbert Rectory, St. Adalbert Convent, and St. Adalbert School, the complex is set to meet Criterion 1 for heritage. Set in the Lower West Side, the church was located within an industrial hub in the city with work and infrastructure bringing Bohemian and Polish immigrants to the area in the mid-to-late-1800s. Founded in 1874, the St. Adalbert’s church was formed to give Polish immigrants in the area their own church after other Polish parishes opened in other areas of the city.  Designed by ecclesiastical architect Henry J Schlacks, the church began construction in 1912 and wrapped up in 1914. At its peak, the church has a congregation of 4,000 families and 2,000 school students. In the mid-20th century, the Polish population began to shrink as they moved out of the neighborhood and Mexican immigrants began moving in. By the 1970s, the congregation was down to 600 families and the Archdiocese announced the planned closure of the church. Community members and parishioners joined forces to protest the plan and successfully fended off the closure.  With the number of parishioners continuing to wane, the Archdiocese again announced the planned closure of the church in 2016 and the last mass was held on July 14th, 2019. With potential plans to sell the property to developers, the archdiocese recently began removing stained glass windows from the church, adding extreme urgency to the long sought landmark designation.  The proposed designation continues onto to list Criterion 4 as one of the criteria for designation, for the building’s exemplary architecture. Designed in the Renaissance Revival style, the church exhibits a distinctive south facade with two 185-foot-tall bell towers and exquisite ornamentation. Clad in cream-colored brick with granite, limestone, and terracotta details throughout, the remaining elevations, while clearly intended as secondary, continue the use of the cream-colored brick.  Built in conjunction with the church and also designed by Schlacks, the rectory exhibits a simplified Renaissance Revival style while also using the cream-colored brick with stone and terracotta detailing. Built in 1928 by architect Paul N. Duca, the convent is also a simple interpretation of Renaissance Revival architecture that blends harmoniously with the church and rectory. Built in 1908, St. Adalbert’s School is a three-story building that divulges from the rest by using red brick with yellow brick ornament. Limestone entryways anchor each end of the facade that features a series of symmetrical rows of windows. Meeting Criterion 5 for being the work of a significant architect, the church and rectory were designed by Henry J. Schlacks, a Chicago-born architect who became known as the specialist of Catholic churches. Schlacks began his career by studying at MIT and trained as a drafting apprentice under Adler and Sullivan.  The final criterion the church complex meets is Criterion 7. Spanning a half city block, St. Adalbert’s Church is a large-scale, Renaissance Revival church that towers 185 feet over a low-scale residential and commercial neighborhood. With its context remaining remarkably similar over the years, the church has been a prominent visual feature for over a century, The landmarks staff have also identified that the complex meets the separate Integrity Criterion. All four of the buildings remain in their original location and the character-defining exterior features, materials, and design are largely intact, converting their historical significance. The significant features of the complex are proposed to be all exterior elevations and rooflines of the church, rectory, convent, and school. The interior of all buildings and a small garage structure will be excluded from protection. Additional guidelines in the designation state that the Commission’s review of proposed work will ensure significant features are preserved while allowing reasonable changes and flexibility to meet the needs of future proposed uses of the structures or new construction on the undeveloped portions of the property. With preliminary landmark designation approved, landmarks staff will present a final report to the Commission before it votes on a final landmark recommendation to send the proposed designation to City Hall. A vote from the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council will be needed to officially designate the buildings as a Chicago landmark. ",Pilsen

Plan Commission approves 18th/Peoria development plan,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved and adopted the 18th and Peoria Development Framework Plan. Spanning 6.3 acres in Pilsen, the property is bounded by 16th St to the north, Newberry Ave to the east, 18th St to the south, and Sangamon St to the west. With the consultant team made up of AECOM, UrbanWorks, and KOO, the process to craft the development plan included an existing conditions report, preliminary sketch plans, numerous public and stakeholder meetings, and multiple revisions to the draft scenario. Split into phases, the development plan calls for a first phase of three 6-7 story mixed-use buildings along W. 18th St which would hold ground floor commercial space with apartments above. Moving north, the second phase would transition to a smaller scale with two 5-story mid-rise residential buildings. Moving further north, phase 3 would build townhomes, 6-flats and 3-flats to match the character of S. Newberry Ave. The final phase, located along the BNSF railway and W. 16th St, would include two 9-story residential buildings with interior parking on the first two floors. The plan calls for adding 2.5 acres of open space which will include a programmable open space, performance space, a playlot, and gathering space. Planned to connect to the Paseo trail, the planned central park will act as a gateway for the Paseo trail. A linear park is planned to run alongside S. Peoria St through the middle of the development.  Through the robust community process, the community identified the fact that they wanted a mix of housing types. The team increased the total unit count from 351 to 432, increased the density at the north and south ends, and minimized the vehicular connections all in response to community feedback. With the plan approved and adopted, next steps will include continued coordination with the Chicago Park District in regards to the future open space and with CDOT for the streetscape improvements and infrastructure needs. The plan is looking to potentially establish a Planned Development to also help govern the future build-out of the site. The Chicago Department of Housing will now be starting to accept Qualified Allocation Plan proposals for the Phase 1 development. ",Pilsen

Urbanize tours construction work at Clarendale Six Corners,"Urbanize recently got the opportunity to tour Clarendale Six Corners as it gets ever nearer to completion. Located at the intersection of W. Irving Park Rd, N. Milwaukee Ave, and N. Cicero Ave, the project is being designed, developed, and constructed by Ryan Companies. Planned as an urban senior living facility, the 10-story mixed-use building will hold 258 residences with 17,500 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. Rising 143 feet, the building will host 114 independent living apartments, 98 assisted living units, and 46 memory care rooms.  The tour began at the point of the building facing the intersection, known as the “prow”. Currently used for construction access, this area will become the retail space with a large entry facing the intersection. Spanning 17,500 square feet, the retail space will stretch into the building mainly along the N. Milwaukee Ave frontage. The residential lobby will face W. Irving Park approximately where the construction skip is currently located.  While not specifically part of the tour, parking within the building will include 45 spaces on the ground floor to support the retail space, with an additional 108 on the second floor designated for the senior residents. Parking will be offered via a valet service as an amenity to seniors, so they don’t have to navigate through the garage. The next stop on the tour was the third floor. Poised as the main gathering space for residents, the developers envision tenants coming up from the street and getting off onto the third floor to engage with the building’s community. Coming off the elevator, there will be a concierge desk and there is a wide hallway to guide visitors and residents towards the lounge space that sits within the prow. Along the windows overlooking N. Milwaukee Ave will be the independent living dining room. Residents in independent living will have full kitchens in their units but can also come to the dining space to eat if they would like.  At the prow, there will be a large bar with seating for happy hours and gathering. In addition, the third-floor amenity space includes a large lounge with a fireplace, a private dining room, a theater room, and an arts studio. The next stop on the third floor was the assisted living dining room. This space will look out over the internal courtyard that will be planted with trees and greenery. A commercial kitchen is placed between the two separate dining spaces to serve both of them easily.  Walking up to the fourth floor, the next stop of the tour was an additional amenity space. A multipurpose space has been provided to offer flexibility in use for residents. The indoor space will overlook the outdoor terrace that sits on the prow, overlooking the Six Corners intersection.  The final stop was looking at some independent living units. As the most typical option for living, the independent living residences offer a full-size kitchen and up to two bedrooms. While they weren’t part of the tour, assisted living units will have a partial kitchen as those residents will need more help in everyday activities and will use the dining option more often. Memory care units will have no kitchen and there will be full-time staff care for those tenants. The $117 million development is rapidly nearing completion. With work very far along, the building is expected to open to new tenants in mid-fall of this year.  ",Portage Park
Six Corners Sears redevelopment clears key vote,"A proposal from developer Novak Construction to redevelop the former Portage Park Sears location into a mixed-use complex won the crucial support of the Chicago Plan Commission. The $90 million project would reuse the commercial structure at 4730 W. Irving Park Road in the Six Corners shopping district, which has sat vacant since closing in July 2018. In addition to repurposing the former department store, the plan would construct a five-story residential wing to the north. The existing building would be reclad with new patterns and window openings to evoke art deco architecture, and the ""lantern"" window on the corner would be rebuilt. The combined structures would be topped by a sixth-floor glass-enclosed amenity level as well as an outdoor pool. The development would deliver 50,000 square feet of commercial space, 207 rental units, and parking for 275 automobiles and 207 bicycles. Only six (2.5 percent of the total) units will be offered at an affordable rate. The developer will pay roughly $2 million into the city’s Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund to satisfy city requirements. Chicago Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox praised the development team for working with his department to increase the pedestrian orientation on all sides of the project. ""This will set the tone for what will happen on the adjacent parcels,"" said Cox. ""It could go either way: [the adjacent parcels] could become much more suburban and car-oriented or it could continue this pattern that is being set by the Sears [project]."" Novak aims to break ground on the Sears redevelopment next spring. Construction is expected to take roughly 18 months to complete.

10-story senior living project tops off in Portage Park,"After breaking ground earlier this year, an upcoming senior living development is looming large over the Six Corners shopping district in Portage Park after recently reaching its final height of 10 stories. Dubbed the Clarendale Six Corners, the $117 million project at 4715 W. Irving Park Road is designed, developed, and built by the Ryan Companies and features 258 age-restricted residences. Unit breakdown in the highly amenitized building includes 114 independent living apartments, 98 assisted living residences, and 46 memory care units. Eleven of the residences will be set aside as on-site affordable housing. The facility is expected to welcome its first residents in fall 2022. The Clarendale is also part of a larger 4-acre development known as The Point that has been in discussion since a Bank of America branch at the site was torn down in 2015. The mixed-use complex will also feature retail space anchored by a new Aldi supermarket as well as off-street parking spaces for 215 motor vehicles.  Meanwhile, plans are in the works to bring more development to the Six Corners intersection. Developer-builder Novak Construction is seeking city approval to adapt the vacant Sears property at nearby 4730 W. Irving Park Road into a new mixed-use complex containing 207 apartments, retail, and 257 parking spaces. The proposal will go before the Chicago Plan Commission on August 19. ",Portage Park
New plan for Six Corners Sears site breaks cover,"On Thursday evening Novak Construction revealed its vision to redevelop the shuttered Sears store at Six Corners in Portage Park into a mixed-use complex with new retail space, parking, and rental units. The plan would breathe new life into the hulking commercial building which has sat vacant since closing in July 2018. Although a joint venture between Tucker Development and Seritage Growth Properties pitched a $200 million proposal to redevelop the store at 4730 W. Irving Park Road, that plan did not move forward. Novak purchased the property in September 2020. ""As many would agree, this site has the potential to play a role in helping to transform our community and give our local economy a boost that is long overdue,"" said Ald. James Gardiner (45th) at a virtual community meeting to discuss the plan. Gardiner noted that Six Corners was once the second busiest shopping district in Chicago, and that the shuttered art deco structure was one of a handful of stores that featured the ""iconic"" second-floor showcase window—an architectural feature the developers hope to retain. Novak's plan would demolish the 1970s-era addition on the east of the building and construct a five-story residential wing to the north and a sixth-floor glass-enclosed amenity area and an outdoor pool. The proposal would also reclad the exterior with a vertical pattern to evoke art deco architecture and rebuild the ""lantern"" section on the corner, which is no longer structurally sound according to the development team. Designed by architecture firm MG2, the proposed mixed-use complex will contain 208 apartments offered in studio, one-, and two-bedroom floorplans. Apartments on the fifth floor will boast 18-foot ceilings and some units will be lofted. Monthly rents are expected to be in the $2.75 to $3 per square foot range, and there will be six affordable-rate residences on-site. The plan includes 50,000 square feet of retail which will be divided into a 45,000-square-foot single-tenant space on the corner and a smaller 5,000-square-foot space fronting Cicero Avenue. There will be 183 parking spaces for residents located in the basement and on the second floor, and a ground-floor garage will contain 89 parking spaces for retail customers. The current plan does not include the former Sears Auto Center on the north side of Cuyler Avenue, but the developers did not rule out redeveloping that portion of the property as part of a future phase.  Novak will need to amend an existing Planned Development to build their proposal and hope to get the city's approval this fall and break ground next spring. Construction will take roughly 18 months. If approved the Sears redevelopment would join the 10-story Clarendale Six Corners senior housing project currently under construction across the street. ",Portage Park
10-story senior living project goes vertical in Portage Park,"It's been less than a month since a big red construction crane appeared above the Six Corners shopping district on Chicago's northwest side. And during that time, the upcoming 10-story senior living development known as the Clarendale Six Corners has started to take shape. The $117 million project—which is designed, developed, and built by the Ryan Companies—is already poking up above the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue,  Irving Park Road, and Cicero Avenue. The new structure replaces an unsightly water-filled pit that sat at the corner for years after a Bank of America branch was torn down in 2015.  When complete, the Clarendale will deliver 258 age-restricted residences. The unit breakdown includes 114 independent living apartments designed, 98 assisted living residences, and 46 units reserved for memory care. Ald. Jim Gardiner (45th) temporarily held up zoning approvals for the project when he took office in 2019 and negotiated with the developer to add 11 affordable housing units. Gardiner told the Sun-Times in 2020 that he was ""most proud"" of getting affordable units to be built on-site when market-rate rents in the building range from $4,000 to $7,500 a month. ""This was a long time coming, and we're ready to be an important anchor in the redevelopment of this prominent intersection,"" said Dan Walsh, Ryan Companies' senior vice president of development, in a groundbreaking news release in January. ""This property will give our residents and employees access to a wide range of amenities right outside their doorstep, all while helping the Six Corners shopping district continue its resurgence as a critical destination for the northwest neighborhoods and powerful engine for the local economy."" The Clarendale is one piece of a larger 4-acre development known as The Point. The mixed-use complex features retail space anchored by a new Aldi supermarket as well as 215 off-street parking spaces. Streetscape improvements include a pair of plazas. There's also a mid-block pedestrian connection that will cut beneath the new building between Milwaukee Avenue and Irving Park Road. The Clarendale Six Corners will create approximately 650 union construction jobs and 200 permanent jobs over a 20-year period, according to its developers.  ",Portage Park
Ryan Companies celebrates groundbreaking of third phase of Pullman Crossings,"Ryan Companies recently celebrated the start of construction on a 170,000-square-foot speculative industrial facility at Pullman Crossings. Pullman Crossings is a 50+ acre industrial park that is part of Pullman Park, a 180-acre, mixed-use development being developed by Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives.  The 10-acre site, located in the historic Pullman neighborhood at 103rd Street and South Woodlawn Avenue, is just minutes away from major interstates including the Bishop Ford Expressway, Highway 20 and Interstate 57.  This project marks Ryan Companies’ third phase of Pullman Crossings with the final phase expected to kick off later this year. The building will include desirable amenities such as outdoor eating areas, exterior bike racks, ESFR fire protection, and a 32-foot clearance height in the warehouse. The flexible design will accommodate a wide range of uses including warehousing and distribution, light manufacturing and several other light industrial uses, as well as provide new Class A space to a supply-constrained submarket. Ryan formed a joint venture with Washington Capital Management Inc on behalf of its clients. Ryan is also developing and building the facility.

Long-awaited Pullman National Monument celebrates grand opening,"This weekend, Chicagoans will get their first opportunity to explore the new visitor center at Pullman National Monument on the city's far south side. The attraction opens within the restored Pullman Clock Tower and Administration building at 11001 S. Cottage Grove Avenue and serves as the focal point for the 12-acre monument campus. Designed in the late-Victorian style by Solon S. Beman, the clocktower was the architectural centerpiece of the community created in the 1880s by industrialist George Pullman to build his eponymous rail sleeper cars. Although envisioned as a master-planned utopia where employees would both live and work, the town was at the center of numerous labor and civil rights struggles including a bloody 1894 strike that brought the nation's railway system to its knees.  

 Preserving Pullman's history has been a decades-long grassroots struggle led by a coalition of preservationists, residents, and local stakeholders. The effort got a major boost in 2015 when President Barack Obama designated Pullman as Chicago's first and only National Monument. However, the Clock Tower building sustained heavy damage from an arsonist's fire in 1998 and required extensive repairs. ""We are thrilled to celebrate with our partners and visitors the grand opening of the visitor center, which was restored and renovated in part through the generosity of the National Park Foundation and its donors,” said Pullman National Monument Superintendent Teri Gage in a statement. ""As a partnership park, Pullman National Monument benefits from the thriving urban community we call home, including the many partners whose efforts over decades have made it possible to preserve and share this special place in Chicago and American history."" The new center features exhibits exploring Pullman's vision to create the country's first planned industrial community, how the Pullman Porters formed the first black labor union in the country, the aforementioned strike, and how the community came together to preserve the historic district. There's even a replica of a Pullman Palace Car Company sleeper. The monument's master developer is the Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives. The restoration of the Clock Tower and Administration building was overseen by architecture firm Bauer Latoza Studio and included ""new plumbing/fire protection, HVAC, telecom, and electrical systems, and exterior building repairs,"" according to general contractor GMA Construction Group. The visitor center is located on the building's ground floor. Work on the upper floors is ongoing.  Taking place on September 4 and 5, the Labor Day weekend grand opening celebration features guided tours of the visitor center, the nearby historic Hotel Florence, and three historic Pullman-built rail cars at the 111th Street Metra Station. The programs are free but will require tickets (offered on a first-come basis) to ensure manageable crowds for social distancing. Supporters of the monument hope the facility will be an economic driver for the Pullman community, which has seen encouraging signs of growth in recent years. This spring, developers cut the ribbon on the affordable Pullman ArtsSpace Lofts—the neighborhood's first new multifamily development in more than 60 years. ",Pullman
Chicago's first indoor track and field facility opens in Pullman,"In Pullman, James McHugh Construction and joint venture partner Bowa Construction have completed Chicago's first Olympic-grade indoor running track. Dubbed the Indoor Track & Field Center at Gately Park, the $53.67 million structure at 10201 S. Cottage Grove Avenue spans nearly 140,000 square feet. The Far South Side facility is home to the area's only hydraulically banked running oval which relies on movable cylinders to vary the angle of the turns. These banked sections of the track can lay flat to accommodate other uses including volleyball, basketball, and non-sporting events. ""This is only the 12th indoor hydraulically banked track of its kind in the U.S., so it was crucial to use the best trade partners to build the track system, which features a complicated series of jacks and pumps within pits at both ends of the track, and all supporting construction such as the super-flat concrete floors,"" said Andy Totten of McHugh Construction in a statement.  The new sports and recreation center was designed by Itasca, Illinois-based Williams Architects. The exterior is wrapped in an aluminum and glass curtainwall, brick-clad architectural precast concrete, traditional masonry veneer, and metal panels. To achieve a column-free layout, the structure's roof was constructed in six massive sections, each spanning 252 by 20 feet and weighing 120 tons. The Gately Indoor Track and Field complex also houses After School Matters programming designed by Eckenhoff Saunders. Amenities include a dance and exercise studio, a culinary teaching kitchen, gathering spaces, a rooftop deck and garden, and multipurpose labs for art, music, science, and technology. Participants and the public will also have access to new baseball fields at Gately Park. First announced back in 2014, the project faced early delays due to Illinois's ongoing budgetary crisis but ultimately secured funding through a combination of city, park district, and private sources—including gifts from Exelon Corporation, Mellody Hobson, and George Lucas. The facility broke ground in mid-2018. The new indoor track is an encouraging development within the greater Pullman community. The facility joins the recently completed Pullman ArtSpace Lofts, the neighborhood's first new multifamily development in more than 60 years.   ",Pullman
Affordable artist housing opens in Pullman Historic District,"Pullman's first new multifamily development in more than 60 years is officially complete. The developers behind the Pullman ArtsSpace Lofts recently held a ribbon-cutting event for the $18 million Far South Side project, although some residents moved into the building in early 2020. Located on Langley Avenue between 111th and 112th streets, the complex is home to 38 live-work rental units offered in studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom layouts. All apartments are reserved for renters earning 60 percent or below of the Area Median Income (AMI), and there is a 2,000-square-foot community space for hosting public events and art exhibitions. The project—which has been in discussion since 2011—comes from nonprofit developers Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, PullmanArts, and Minneapolis-based Artspace. The overall development includes a three-story new construction building designed by Stantec and a pair of 1880s-era structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The new masonry building rises between its historic neighbors and is designed to complement the Romanesque Rival architecture of the surrounding historic district. Pullman was founded in 1880 by railcar tycoon George Pullman and is considered the nation's first planned industrial community. Because the historic neighborhood is a U.S. Monument, the ArtSpace Lofts team had to work closely with the National Park Service and the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development. The development took advantage of Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits, Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and assistance from the Chicago Housing Authority.  ",Pullman

Mary Cook Associates release images of The Raven amenities,"Chicago-based interior design firm Mary Cook Associates has announced the completion of common areas and amenities for The Raven Residences in Chicago's Ravenswood neighborhood. Developer Harlem Irving Companies tapped Mary Cook Associates to design the common areas and amenity interiors at The Raven Residences, a transit-oriented rental community comprising 167 apartments and townhomes in a pair of four-story brick buildings at 4733 N. Wolcott, located in Chicago’s Ravenswood neighborhood steps from CTA Brown Line and Metra commuter rail stations. The MCA-designed common spaces feature clean lines, matte black metals and brickwork that reference The Raven’s exterior architecture and reflect a modern, industrial yet luxurious feel inspired by the vernacular of the Ravenswood Corridor and its many breweries, restaurants and art galleries. Occupying a relatively compact footprint within the property, The Raven’s communal spaces are thoughtfully designed to foster a sense of community by providing ample opportunities for socialization as well as privacy through a mix of flexible amenities accommodating remote work or quiet relaxation. “Given the scale of the amenity spaces at The Raven compared to what renters might find at large multifamily high-rises in the city, our team prioritized multifunctionality to make the most of every space and give residents a wide variety of amenity offerings to enhance their lifestyle,” said Cook. “We also considered the location of this community and the renters who are drawn to the Ravenswood neighborhood for its combination of quiet, tree-lined residential streets, great local shopping and dining, and easy transit access to downtown Chicago. And while MCA is a national design firm with work all over the country, our office happens to be located in Ravenswood – so our team used our direct experience with this neighborhood and its residents to really inform our design in an authentic way.” ",Ravenswood

Four-story infill condo building ready to rise along Montrose,"A Chicago developer was awarded an estimated $7 million building permit to break ground on a four-story luxury condo building in Ravenswood Manor just ten months after plans for a taller, denser rental project were smacked down by the local alderperson. 2910 W Montrose LLC received the go-ahead to replace Paradise Spa & Sauna and an adjacent parking lot at the northeast corner of Montrose Avenue and Richmond Street with 18 for-sale residences and parking for 31 cars. The masonry building includes up to 6,700 square feet of ground-floor retail space, according to a recent marketing flyer for the property. SGW Architecture and Design is listed as the architect. The team had previously pitched a five-story rental building containing 59 apartments and 31 parking spaces at the site. That proposal died last October when Ald. Rossana Rodriguez (33rd) denied the project's requested zoning change from B3-2 to B2-3, citing overwhelming negative feedback from neighbors. ""The community does not feel that this development is a good fit for the neighborhood,"" the alderwoman wrote in her rejection letter. ""The development is too large, too dense, too expensive, does not provide enough two- and three-bedroom (family) units, and does not provide enough parking."" The developer behind the 2910 W. Montrose project, Alan Candea, came under further public scrutiny after his brother Armand Candea—also a real estate developer—published controversial Facebook posts including calls for Chicago to ""recruit snipers"" during last summer's episodes of looting and social unrest. Ald. Rodriguez called the post ""really concerning"" and factored it into her zoning decision, according to Block Club Chicago. The current redevelopment plan for the Ravenswood Manor property is scaled back to conform with existing zoning and therefore did not need the support of the local alderperson. The previous proposal called for six affordable-rate units, but the revised project isn't required to include any affordable housing because it did not seek a zoning change or other assistance from the city.

Office to residential conversion proposed at 500 N. Michigan,"Connecticut-based developer Commonwealth Development Partners is looking to convert the office building at 500 N. Michigan into residential. Located along the Mag Mile, the 304-foot-tall, 24-story building was originally built 1968 and houses a series of retail tenants with most of its office space vacant. Designed by GREC Architects, the building would be converted into 320 residential dwelling units on floors 6-23. Retail would remain on the first two floors with office space retained on the third through fifth floors. Residents would have access to amenity space on the seventh floor as well as a new rooftop amenity space on the 24th floor. This top floor amenity space would be both indoor and outdoor but would require additional FAR to be obtained through the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund bonus framework while also increasing the building height from 304 feet to 321 feet.  The building has a parking garage on the basement with valet service that can accommodate 68 cars. Access is from Lower Illinois St and would be continued as valet service after the conversion. The redevelopment will need to amend the existing Planned Development for the project.

Zoning filed to sunset approved development at 225 W. Chicago,"A zoning application has been filed by developer Centrum Realty & Development to sunset the approved Planned Development located at 225 W. Chicago. Also known by the address of 777 N. Franklin, the project site is located at the southeast corner of the intersection of W. Chicago Ave and N. Franklin St, directly adjacent to the Chicago/Franklin CTA Brown Line station. Designed by local architect Hirsch MPG, the nine-story office building planned for the site was approved by City Council in April 2020. The 123,000-square-foot building would have included 5,200 square feet of retail space on the ground floor with the remaining floors providing leasable office space. Office tenants would have had access to amenities on the top floor that would’ve included a fitness center, conference center, and lounge. Now listed for sale by CBRE, the marketing brochure touts the site’s approved Planned Development which locks the property into the office scheme, but also offers the rezoning as a way to open up the property to other options. If rezoned back to DX-5 like the rezoning seeks to, a new developer could build as many as 121 residential units with a 3.1 FAR bonus or also pursue other uses like hotel or mixed-use. For the zoning change to move forward, approvals will be needed from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. The property is listed with an asking price of $5.75 million. ",River North
Demolition permits issued for historic structures at Wells/Superior,"Demolition permits have been issued for two historic structures that are set to meet the wrecking ball at the southwest corner of N. Wells St and W. Superior St. First announced in February, the demolition is being planned by Topography Hospitality and KF Partners LLC and the structures are set to be replaced by a five-story new development, but the scope of that project is unclear. The three-story brick and wood framed structure at 720 N. Wells was built near the time of the Chicago Fire but is green-rated on the Chicago Historic Resources Survey with no protections from demolition. The Italianate structure at 207 W. Superior is estimated to be from the 1880s and is listed as orange-rated on the Chicago Historic Resources Survey. It was placed on the 90-day demolition delay list in mid-2023 and was ultimately released in August 2023. Permits list Milburn Demolition as the demolition contractor and work is expected to proceed through June. According to Alderman Reilly’s newsletter, the new development is expected to begin in September of this year, but no permits have been filed. ",River North
Landmark recommendation approved for the John B. Murphy Memorial,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the John B. Murphy Memorial. Located at 50 E. Erie, the building was completed in 1926 for the American College of Surgeons (ACS) as a memorial to one of its founders, Dr. John B. Murphy, who was a surgeon and teacher committed to improving the art and science of surgical practice.  The building meets Criterion 1 for its heritage. The John B. Murphy Memorial represents the legacy and lasting ideals of Dr. Murphy for the reform of surgical practice through the establishment of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). The ACS occupied the building as an auditorium with office and library spaces from its completion in 1926 through the 1930s, and as an occasional professional meeting hall until 2003. The memorial building was built with donations from over 2,000 Chicagoans and was transferred as a gift to the ACS as part of their permanent home and headquarters in Chicago. Locating the ACS in Chicago was intended to make Chicago the center of both surgical research and of the profession.   Meeting Criterion 3 for its association with a significant person, the memorial building is named for Dr. John B. Murphy, who was a critical and significant figure in helping reform and organize the practice of surgery in the United States. He was a founding member of the ACS, which was founded in 1913 to organize the profession and establish academic and professional standards, as well as standards for surgical practice and hospital design. Dr. Murphy was a leader in surgery who developed and improved many surgical procedures and also established a new way to teach surgical methods through clinical classroom operations on real patients and by publishing his lectures in his own non-commercial journal.  Also meeting Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture, the Murphy Memorial's exterior design represents a rare Chicago example of the French Renaissance style, known for its classically inspired details. The exterior is of Bedford limestone with an exceptional set of bronze doors and carved ornamental detailing. It includes brackets, pediments, columns, capitals, garlands, cartouches, finials, and other classical ornament. The interior is finely crafted with materials that include marble, highly ornate plasterwork, carved woodwork, cast and wrought metal, and stained glass.  The building also meets Criterion 5 for its important architect, the firm of Marshall & Fox. The firm was very popular for designing theaters, residences, hotels, clubs, and commercial buildings. The firm brought Classical elegance combined with modern luxury to these building types. Benjamin Marshall is acknowledged as one of the most important and influential architects in Chicago during the first decades of the twentieth century. His work in the design of theaters contributed to the overall interior design and layout of the Murphy Memorial's main auditorium.   The final criterion was Criterion 7 for its unique visual features. The Murphy Memorial's highly ornamented facade, monumental scale, and slight setback from the street make it a visually prominent building that is highly visible along Erie Street, between Rush Street and Wabash Avenue.  The building's form as a memorial, with its symmetrical facade defined by paired stairs, grand bronze doors, and a carved limestone portico with paired columns and a pediment, makes it a highly unique and rare building type in Chicago.   Also meeting the Integrity Criterion, the building possesses excellent physical integrity in its exterior and interior. The most significant alterations occurred in 2003 when two elevators and three-story additions were built between the memorial building's west elevation and the east elevation of the Nickerson Mansion. New windows were also added on the top level of the east elevation. Alterations to the interior lobbies, stairwells, and the auditorium include select new lighting and some audio-visual equipment. Despite these changes, the building retains its ability to express its architectural and historical value. The commission staff recommends the significant features to be protected be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building as well as the major historic interior spaces including the lobby leading to the auditorium from the bronze doors, the anteroom to the west of the auditorium, and the auditorium itself. The designation includes a provision to allow for the modifications planned by the Driehaus Museum as part of their renovation of the structure. With the final recommendation approved, the proposed designation will now go before the Committee on Zoning and City Council for final approval. ",River North

Permits are in the works for hotel development at 430 N. LaSalle,"Permits have been filed for a long-awaited hotel development at 430 N. LaSalle. Located at the northwestern corner of N. LaSalle Dr and W. Hubbard St, the project site is currently a surface parking lot. Planned by Porritt Group, the 16-story hotel building is planned to have 341 hotel rooms with a rooftop lounge and deck. Representing a scaled back plan, the originally approved scheme called for a 19-story tower that would’ve stood 235 feet tall with 196 hotel rooms.  Designed by Saroki Architecture, the 170,000 square foot development would be clad in a glass curtain wall with an inset in the building’s massing at the top for the outdoor deck. The building will have zero parking spaces. Originally approved back in September 2016, the developer received a one-year sunset extension for the Planned Development back in September 2022, avoiding the expiration of the approved Planned Development.

Salesforce Tower celebrates opening,"Salesforce has officially opened the doors of Salesforce Tower Chicago. Situated at the convergence of the north and south branches of the Chicago River, Salesforce Tower Chicago will serve as a beacon of Salesforce’s culture and our values, and a central gathering place for employees, customers, partners, and Trailblazers from around the world. The top two floors in the 57-story office building are dedicated ‘Ohana Floors, spaces for their employees and guests to enjoy during the day, and available for local nonprofits to host fundraising events at night and on weekends at no cost. To date, the company’s ‘Ohana Floors around the world have helped raise more than $108 million for local communities. For Salesforce Tower Chicago, the company has applied all they’ve learned post-pandemic to design spaces for how employees work today. When employees first came back to the office, it was primarily for collaboration, whether it be presentations, team off-sites, or brainstorms. Now that teams are coming in regularly, we’re also hearing that they need space for heads-down, focused work. Throughout the building, the design prioritizes flexibility and employee choice to ensure every individual and team can be successful. The employee floors have been designed to provide focus spaces, like libraries and focus pods, and areas for team collaboration and connection, like event spaces and communal kitchens. These zones are separated acoustically at opposite ends of the floor to support a neurodiverse population and offer more choices for employees. Throughout the workspaces are a mix of mindfulness rooms, pods of height-adjustable desks, and meeting and training rooms. The library spaces provide a variety of individual work settings, including natural light at some seats or, if employees choose, darker spaces with tactile surfaces and task lighting for user control. We’ve doubled the size of the social lounges on our employee floors to allow teams to transform these spaces for bespoke events and use them throughout the day as a working cafe. We’ve also added more conference and training rooms and flexible meeting space, equipped with the latest hybrid-work technology and room layouts to ensure our teams can connect with colleagues and customers around the world. As one of their most sustainable buildings to date, Salesforce Tower Chicago is on track to achieve LEED v4 Gold Certification for the exterior of the building, LEED v4 Platinum for the interiors, and Zero Carbon Certification. The building is also powered by all-electric systems, meaning there is no on-site use of fossil fuels. It is the first building in Chicago to require Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to quantify the embodied carbon emissions of concrete and steel, resulting in a 19% overall reduction in carbon emissions compared to the industry average.

Urbanize tours progress at 741 N. Wells,"Urbanize recently toured progress on Vista Property’s latest development in Chicago at 741 N. Wells. Formerly occupied by a one-story retail building and three-story structure, the new tower will rise just off W. Chicago Ave, offset by a historic brick building that will be retained at 755 N.

The building will include 50 studios, 101 one-bedrooms and 17 two-bedrooms, as well as a rooftop terrace with pool, meeting facilities, exercise area, bicycle storage for 150 bikes and parking for 51 cars. With Skender Construction leading the construction for the project and our walkthrough, we began by heading up to the top of the building. With the 19th floor slab poured just a couple days ahead, our tour began on the 18th floor where scaffolding is in place holding up the deck above. Looking out from the building, you can already see the expansive views that future residents will have. Nearby developments visible include JDL Development’s 920 N. Wells at North Union, North Wells Capital’s 311 W. Huron, Sterling Bay’s 360 N. Green in the distance, and Structured Development’s Big Deahl tower rising in the distance further north.  Heading down the building, a few of the floors right below 18 still have pole shores in place as the concrete decks fully cure. Our next stop was the 8th floor, where the facade is being installed. Designed as a window wall system, crews working further ahead install metal tracks on the concrete slabs for window pieces to clip into. Crews lift the individual window wall pieces into place, locking and sealing them as they go.  Working our way down, we stopped briefly on the sixth floor, where framing has been installed around the stairwells and workers have made more progress on installing mechanical systems. Stopping next on the fourth floor, we stepped out onto the roof deck. Residential units that face the fourth floor deck will each get their own private terrace.  Our next stop was the parking garage, which will have parking for 51 cars. The third floor includes space for a dog wash and dog run as a tenant amenity, while the second floor includes a bike room for 150 bikes. As an amenity-focused development, residents will also have access to meeting rooms, a fitness center, and a rooftop terrace with pool once the tower is completed.  Wrapping up the tour, we walked through the ground floor which will have 9,400 square feet of retail space flanking a center residential lobby. Currently, the construction hoist lands right where the entryway will be for residents.  With work progressing quickly, Skender expects to top out the tower later this month and enclose the entire building with glass by late Spring.

Permits issued for Medinah Temple temporary casino,"Building permits have been issued for the temporary casino at Medinah Temple planned by Bally’s Corporation. As part of their winning casino bid, Bally’s will be operating a temporary casino at Medinah Temple until the full-fledged casino is completed at the site of the current Tribune Freedom Center printing plant. With STL Architects on board for the conversion, the plan will renovate the interior while avoiding any building changes to the landmarked exterior. Originally built in 1912 by architects Huel and Schmid, the building was home to the Chicago Shriners and was designed in a Moorish style with extensive ornament that makes it a unique building amongst its surrounding context. Protected by landmark designation, the exterior will remain unchanged with the exception of new signs replacing the old signs. The current signage from Bloomingdale’s will be removed and replaced with Bally’s signage that matches the same configuration and scale.   On the interior, Bloomingdale’s conversion in 2003 saw the filling in of the original 4,200-seat auditorium to create larger floor plates for the store. Since the proscenium was also protected by the landmark status, it was retained and painted white. With SOSH Architects working on the interior, the casino plan will see the removal of most of the interior partitions to open up the floors to casino gaming. Any new walls and rooms on the top floor would be built below the original ceiling to keep the coffered ceilings intact. With permits issued for the construction, general contractor Gilbane Building Company can begin work to finish by Bally’s target of a Summer 2023 opening. Once open, it is planned to run for 24 months until the full casino site is opened to the public. ",River North

Bally’s secures financing and redesigns casino to include hotel tower,"Bally’s Corporation has announced a refreshed plan for Bally’s Chicago casino that restores the previously planned 500-room, 34-story hotel tower into a single-phase construction project at the 30-acre former Tribune Publishing site at 777 W. Chicago With HKS Architects on board for the redesign, the future Bally’s Chicago Casino will feature its hotel tower on the southern end of the casino development near Ohio Street along the Chicago River. The hotel tower will include a large pool spa, fitness center and sun deck, as well as a rooftop restaurant bar to enjoy the Chicago skyline. Earlier this year, the hotel tower was moved due to unforeseen underground infrastructure and an adjusted design for a two-phase hotel was approved. Bally’s Chicago Casino development will harness the beauty of the urban Chicago riverfront site to create inclusive, dynamic spaces, including plans for the 500-room hotel tower, 3,000-seat theater, six restaurants, cafes and a food hall, and a 2-acre public park. The casino will offer space for approximately 3,300 slots, 173 table games and VIP gaming areas. The lower riverbank will be connected to the property with an approximately 2,000-foot-long extension of the riverwalk extending south from W. Chicago Avenue.  “We’ve been working hard in the background to restore the full hotel tower for Bally’s Chicago Casino and absolutely intend to meet the September 2026 opening date as planned,” said George Papanier, President of Bally’s Corporation. “We are also happy to announce that Gaming and Leisure Properties has agreed to finance this entire development in a single phase to ultimately deliver a better project in a more efficient manner.” Bally’s and Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc (GLPI) have entered into a binding term sheet for a $940 million construction funding facility for the Chicago project, along with other financing transactions, that together GLPI expects to fund $2.07 billion to Bally’s.

Plan Commission approves Halsted Landing at 700 W. Chicago,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved the mixed-use multi-phase development dubbed Halsted Landing. Addressed at 700 W. Chicago, the project site is located at the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St along the Chicago River, just across the street from Bally’s Casino and across the river from Onni Group’s Halsted Point where the developer recently secured financing for their Phase 1 tower. While the project’s zoning application was filed at the end of July 2023, the property was also previously conceived as a multi-phase office development that was canceled in the aftermath of COVID. Designed by Goettsch Partners, the multi-phase development will see the construction of four new mixed-use skyscrapers. Set to total 2,451 residential units, the project will support the housing with ground-floor retail space, 1,950 parking spaces located underground, 2,451 bike parking spaces and extensive exterior landscaping along the Chicago River.  Split into three subareas, the first subarea will be located along N. Halsted St up against the river. Planned to be the first phase of the overall project, the mixed-use tower will have a four-story podium topped by an 11-story midrise portion and a 56-story point tower. Reaching 600 feet tall, the tower volume will be clad in a window wall system with outdoor balconies running up the facade. The building will have 540 residential units in the tower and 148 podium and liner units. The ground floor will include retail space alongside the residential lobby that will both face south onto a new access road through the site. The second subarea and phase of the proposal, located at the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St will include a 500-foot-tall, 44-story skyscraper. The building will have 382 residential units in the tower and 160 podium and liner units. With retail wrapping around the entire ground floor, there will be a total of 33,300 square feet of retail space. The residential lobby will face east towards a newly extended N. Jefferson St. This second phase will also add a 9-story commercial midrise along N. Halsted St. Adjacent to the first phase of the development, the building will front N. Halsted St with 3,800 square feet of retail space and the residential lobby will face south towards the new access drive. The third subarea, planned along W. Chicago Ave at the river, will have two towers linked by a four-story podium. Rising 51-story, the west skyscraper will stand 550 feet tall and feature 540 residential units in the tower and 45 podium and liner units. Rising 650 feet in height, the eastern skyscraper will stand 57 stories with 606 residential units in the tower and 30 podium or liner units. Between the two towers, the podium will include 8,400 square feet of retail space. With Confluence serving as the landscape architect, the riverfront has been designed with a riverwalk that will connect to future extensions in an area that has been cut off from the Chicago River by industry for over a century. The proposed design reestablishes that connection with multiple pathways from street to river, linkages to adjacent riverwalk segments, and programming that celebrates the beauty and energy of the river.  The site has a grade change of about 30 feet from street to waterfront which poses significant challenges for access. The design creates a series of distinct experiences including vibrant urban streetscape, elevated belvedere terraces, tiered step and planting zones, an inviting waterfront, and a dramatic pedestrian bridge across the river.  The riverwalk will feature a water taxi stop, drink rail with stool seating, shared riverwalk area, terraced seating, overlook deck with shade structure, riverwalk restaurant seating, overlook stage platform with canopy, amphitheater, retail spaces, native riparian planting trail, playground with climbing wall, potential floating wetland area, riverwalk bike parking, and a restaurant overlook terrace. The overall development will meet ARO requirements with 490 affordable units. Phase 1 will have 688 total units, with 138 of those set aside as affordable. The $1.1 billion development will contribute $17.8 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, $3.8 million into the Industrial Corridor Conversion Fee, $2.2 million in Local Impact Funds, and $2.2 million to the citywide Adopt-A-Landmark program.  With approval from the Chicago Plan Commission secured, the proposal will now look to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. Onni has projected that Phase 1 will be built from Q1 2029 through Q3 2031, Phase 2 from Q3 2031 to Q1 2034, and Phase 3 from Q1 2034 through Q1 2037. ",River West

Bally’s Casino hotel tower will shift due to city water pipes,"Bally’s Chicago has been forced to redesign the casino and hotel tower after finding out that caissons for the proposed tower would potentially damage municipal water management infrastructure pipes near the Chicago River. Bally’s Chairman Soo Kim reported that the tower needs to be relocated from the north end of the site and they have to come up with a new design because they can’t put it along W. Chicago Ave. The findings came to light after Bally’s began a detailed exploration of the foundation needs for the 500-room tower.  With Gensler on board for the design of the casino, the team is looking to redesign the project with a three-story, 100-room hotel atop the casino complex's northeast corner, with the remaining 400 rooms coming in a second-phase building that will likely be justified towards the southern end of the site and shorter than originally planned.  Bally’s reportedly expects to finalize the revised plans for the first-phase, 100-room hotel in the next few weeks, while the new tower will need months to be resolved. While the revisions represent a change in design, the overall 500-room commitment will be kept, according to Bally’s Chairman Soo Kim and they will not need to undergo a full review process for the changes. Kim also said this would not delay the 2026 opening of the casino.  This redesign process is also reflected in the project’s permitting process. Back in October 2023, Bally’s filed a foundation permit for a ten-story events center, five-story casino building, and 35-story, 500-key hotel tower. Now in January 2024, a new foundation permit filing lists just a four-story casino building with a 100-key hotel and events center.  ",River West

As part of Bally’s progress on the project, the development team has been outlined in detail. Bally’s Corporation and minority-ownership Community Investment Programs make up the ownership team. Architects Solomon Cordwell Buenz are leading the masterplan in collaboration with V3 Companies, Gensler, and Site Design Group. Gensler has taken over the architecture of the entire complex, except for the hotel tower which Solomon Cordwell Buenz will be the architect for. Site Design Group will be the landscape architect, SOSH Architects will lead the casino’s interior design, STL Architects will lead the theater interior design, and local firms UrbanWorks and Nia Architects are working as associated architects.  For engineering, V3 Companies will be leading civil engineering and site infrastructure, Magnusson Klemencic Associates and Milhouse Engineering will be the structural engineers, and MEP engineering will be done by Environmental Systems Design and Milhouse Engineering. The owner’s project development advisors include DMA, Rider Levett Bucknall, and BRG Consulting Ltd. Chicago Community Builders Collective will be the project’s general contractor. With site plan approval secured, Bally's Chicago has the city approval to begin construction as planned late in 2024. Prior to opening gaming operations, they must meet Illinois Gaming Board regulatory and statutory requirements. ",River West
City Council approves rezoning for Bally’s Casino,"The Chicago City Council has approved the rezoning for Bally’s Casino at 777 W. Chicago. Sited along the Chicago River, the casino will replace the existing Chicago Tribune printing facility, reaching W. Chicago Ave to the north, W. Grand Ave to the south, and N. Halsted St to the west. As part of a revised River District masterplan, the casino will eventually be joined by a collection of mixed-use towers on the larger site. Set to transform the current industrial facility, the plan calls for Phase 1 to build the casino and associated uses to create a vibrant entertainment district. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the first phase will be anchored by a 500-foot-tall hotel tower at the north end of the site, standing 33-stories high with 500 hotel keys and a rooftop restaurant. Holding 4,000 gaming positions and more than 10 food and beverage offerings, the casino will occupy a large swath of land along the riverfront south of the hotel tower and bookended to the south by a 3,000-seat theater and event center. A 23,000 square-foot museum will be included in the building along the riverwalk. After extensive conversations about parking, Bally’s has removed the above-ground parking structure along W. Chicago Ave and has opted for another level of parking below the casino floor, totaling 2,500 spaces. A further 700 spaces will be built on surface lots occupying the future sites of the proposed mixed-use towers and will be temporary. These temporary spots will allow the city and Bally’s to monitor parking needs. If those extra 700 spots do indeed prove to be necessary, the future phases will be amended to include that extra parking as permanent.  Considering roadway access, the development would see the construction of N. Jefferson St as the main north/south arterial with new extensions of W. Huron St, W. Ancona St, W. Erie St, and N. Desplaines St. For vehicular access to the casino, regional traffic will be directed into the parking garages from W. Grand Ave up on N. Jefferson St where they will enter the underground parking garage before they would get to the new intersection with W. Erie St. Local traffic may enter from any direction with a second, smaller entry to parking garages accessible from N. Jefferson St at the north side of the casino. Loading and delivery trucks will be ushered to a separate loading dock area by entering from W. Grand Ave and using a service drive that keeps them at a below-grade level. With Site Design Group on board for the landscape design, the overall site has been adorned with extensive green space and parks, increasing the overall public open space from the originally approved Planned Development. At the north end of the site, a large drop-off and valet will be the main entry point to the casino and hotel, with lush landscaping added to give as much space back to people and beautify this northern entry to the site. With a newly constructed Jefferson St as the main corridor, the streetscape has been designed to be pedestrian friendly, with crosswalk bump-outs, extra street trees as possible and active connections to the riverwalk.  The main landscape feature for Phase 1 will be the Riverfront Park, south of the event center. This sloped park will create an experience of direct steps down to the riverwalk and sloped walkways that meander through the green space. Open lawns, a dog park, and other programmed spaces will be incorporated into the park while allowing for as much lush greenery as possible. The park will also connect the riverwalk which will offer a long walkway between W. Chicago Ave and W. Grand Ave, offering a mix of hardscape and softscape elements that work to enliven the water's edge for visitors. A water taxi stop and floating wetlands will be incorporated to allow for public access to the water. The future phases of the overall Planned Development will likely involve separate developers but is currently planned for a remainder 5.6 million square feet of mixed-use buildings. 4,799 units of housing, 300 hotel keys, and 125,000 square feet of retail would be allowed. A linear park running along N. Jefferson St will add more public green space with a dedicated bike lane. A new transitway along the Union Pacific alignment has been envisioned to pass through the site as well.  With full City Council approval both of the city’s casino agreement and the rezoning for its construction, Bally’s is left with only one more hurdle - the Illinois Gaming Commission. If approved by the state commission, construction could proceed on the permanent casino. Completion of the casino, hotel tower, riverwalk, and riverfront park is targeted for 2026.  ",River West

City Council approves NOMA,"The Chicago City Council has approved NOMA, a multi-phased development planned for a collection of sites all generally bound by N. Desplaines St, W. Hubbard St., N. Halsted St, and W. Ohio St. Originally revealed by Urbanize back in June, the multi-tower development surrounding the former Salvation Army building is being developed by Shapack Partners, with Alec and Jennifer Litowitz as capital partners. With New York-based ODA working on the project, the design calls for four new towers that will join the Salvation Army building. While not currently designed, the towers have been conceptualized to enhance and contribute to the public realm at street level. In response to Committee on Design and DPD feedback, the amount of open public space has been increased with more open-air plazas, reducing the amount of covered areas. At the northern site, a covered public plaza will anchor and activate the corner of N. Desplaines St and W. Grand Ave. Heading west on W. Grand Ave, the public realm around the Salvation Army building will be updated and improved for the new hotel planned for the building. Moving south down N. Union Ave, the northern portion of Parcel C will now be allocated as a triangular outdoor plaza with public art planned for the rail embankment. Looking west, a midblock crosswalk will connect pedestrians to the next public space, which will be a covered portion of Mews. Along N. Milwaukee Ave the covered Mews will turn into open air space within Parcel B. At the southwest end, the final property will have a corner plaza that opens up to the intersection of W. Hubbard St and N. Milwaukee Ave. Rising above the public realm, the sites will become home to four new towers. Subarea B in the northern Planned Development will see an approximately 625-foot-tall tower that will include office space, roughly 700 rental units, and ground floor retail space. The southern Planned Development will see a combined total of approximately 800 new rental units, with a 500-foot tower slated for Subarea C, a 400-foot tower planned for Subarea B, and a 350-foot tower anticipated for Subarea A. Each building will meet the ground with active retail spaces and residential lobbies. The first phase of the project will adaptively reuse the Salvation Army building at 509 N. Union, turning it into a boutique hotel. Dating back to 1891, the building stands six stories tall and was originally a margarine factory. With one half of the building made of timber framing and the other half a concrete vault structure, architects Eckenhoff Saunders Architects have designed a two-story addition for the southern portion of the building.  Rising 111 feet, the 30,000 square foot addition will be setback 10 feet from the front facade on its first floor and another 10 feet on the second floor. Providing 141 hotel rooms, the addition will also allow for a new amenity deck for hotel guests. On the ground floor, a restaurant space has been added that will include space inside a one-story building on the north side that is from the 1960s. The iconic water tower on top of the building will be retained as part of the project. With the overall development expected to build out exclusively rental units, the project will incorporate 20% affordability on-site. Between both Planned Developments, an almost $15 million Neighborhood Opportunity Fund payment is also expected. With approval from the City Council, work can proceed on the conversion of the Salvation Army as the first phase. Shapack Partners will need to secure funding before construction can start and future towers will be subject to site plan approval by DPD and CDOT.  ",River West

Workforce housing at 7603 N. Paulina misses out on funding,"Developer Housing for All LLC’s proposal for a mixed-use workforce housing development at 7603 N. Paulina was reportedly not selected for the highly competitive tax credits from the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA). Announced via Alderwoman Hadden’s newsletter to constituents, the development team plans to reapply and is going to rework plans and the phasing of the project. Planned for the northeast corner of W. Howard St and N. Paulina St, the development will demolish the one-story building at the corner, while preserving the Werner Bros. Storage building, an orange-rated structure built in 1921, despite originally planning to demolish it. The proposal includes plans to construct 104 units over two phases, 82 of which would be set aside for households earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI). The remaining 22 would be set aside for households earning at or below 30% AMI. 10% of the units would be set aside as type A fully accessible units, with another 20% set aside as easily adaptable to fully accessible.  With Cordogan Clark & Associates serving as the architect, the corner building would be six stories tall with 52 units, broken down into 7 studios, 11 one-beds, 21 two-beds, and 13 three-beds. 41 of them will be rented at or below 60% AMI, while the remaining 11 will be rented at 30% AMI. The ground floor would hold retail space, a community room, laundry room, fitness center, bike room, resident storage, and management offices. While the developers have committed to retaining the Werner Bros. Storage building, details for the design of the second phase had not been shared. The second phase would bring 52 more units of affordable housing, including 20 inside the Werner Bros. building and 32 apartments in a new construction building in the parking lot to its north. While waiting to reapply for funding, Alderwoman Hadden reported that the development team has met with the Departments of Planning and Development and Housing to discuss the project and get alignment from the city. Housing for All is also using this time to rework their plans for site development. They plan to switch phases - focusing now on rehabilitating the Werner Building and the new construction to the north while leaving the one-story building that houses Redz Belizean and the currency exchange at the corner.  The developers have also closed on the purchase of the properties spanning 7603-7619 N. Paulina and 1646-1660 W. Howard. Work will begin around the building as crews begin to clean the interior, repair windows and doors, add security and new lighting, and secure the site. Additionally, the development team has been working diligently with the retail tenants to ensure a smooth transition to temporary spaces as site work is completed.  ",Rogers Park
Workforce housing gets updated design at 7603 N. Paulina,"Developer Housing for All LLC has come back with a revised design for a mixed-use workforce housing development at 7603 N. Paulina. Planned for the northeast corner of W. Howard St and N. Paulina St, the development will demolish the one-story building at the corner for its first phase, while deciding to preserve the Werner Bros. Storage building, an orange-rated structure built in 1921, after originally planning to demolish it. With Cordogan Clark & Associates serving as the architect, the corner building has been redesigned while maintaining its height of six stories. Set to include 52 units, the mix will include 7 studios, 11 one-beds, 21 two-beds, and 13 three-beds. 41 of them will be rented at or below 60% AMI, while the remaining 11 will be rented at 30% AMI.  With 4,400 square feet of retail space planned for the ground floor, the developers are looking to keep the existing currency exchange and restaurant as tenants while relocating the post office from its current spot in the existing building. The ground floor of the new building will also hold a community room, laundry room, fitness center, bike room, resident storage, and management offices all along the N. Paulina St frontage. While the developers have now committed to retaining the Werner Bros. Storage building, details for the design of the second phase have not been shared. The second phase will bring 52 more units of affordable housing, including 20 inside the Werner Bros. building and 32 apartments in a new construction building in the parking lot to its north. The $30 million development will need a zoning change and Planned Development designation from the city, requiring hearings before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. The project also needs to get financing from the state to move forward. If approvals and funding are secured, the first phase could break ground in late 2025, with the second phase potentially completed by late 2026. ",Rogers Park
Workforce housing proposed for 7603 N. Paulina,"Developer Housing for All LLC has proposed a mixed-use workforce housing development at 7603 N. Paulina. Planned for the northeast corner of W.

Storage building, an orange-rated structure built in 1921. With Cordogan Clark & Associates serving as the architect, the final building will stand six floors, delivering 110 residential units as well as approximately 15,000 square feet of ground floor retail space. The project’s unit mix will include 16 studios, 24 one-beds, 42 two-beds, and 28 three-bedroom apartments. 88 of the 110 units will be set aside for households earning at or below 60% AMI, with the remaining 22 units set aside for those earning at or below 30% AMI.  With new retail space on the ground floor, the developer will be working with existing retail tenants to ensure they do not get displaced, including the post office. The development team is exploring new market tax credits, which could help them pass cost savings to potential commercial tenants to keep retail rents affordable. While the underlying zoning at both sites of B1-3 will remain the same, the size of the lot will trigger a Planned Development process. The developer has submitted an application to the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) for an assessment for tax credits. If approved, the application would then go before IHDA's board in June for a final determination. The developer would also seek supplemental financing options from the City of Chicago's Department of Housing. With the proposal still in the early stages of planning, it will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council for the Planned Designation as well as for any city funding requests. If funding and project approval falls into place, construction could start as soon as late 2023 with first move-ins projected for late 2025 ",Rogers Park
Five-story TOD breaks ground at former Heartland Cafe site,"In Rogers Park, work is underway on a new five-story, mixed-use building at the former site of the Heartland Cafe restaurant. The transit-oriented development will bring 2,500 square feet of retail, 30 residential units, and parking for 15 cars and 30 bicycles to the northwest corner of Lunt and Glenwood avenues. Developer AGE Properties received a permit to break ground on the North Side project back in June 2020 but experienced ""significant delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain shortages, and an electricity grid issue they had to resolve with ComEd,"" according to a recent email notice from Ald. Maria Hadden (49th). The developer initially pitched a six-story structure with 60 units for the site. That plan needed a zoning change and would have required the project to include 10 percent (six units) of affordable housing. Hadden ultimately opposed the zoning change after pushback from the community, so the current proposal is being built ""as of right"" (ie without a zoning change) and will include no affordable units. Designed by SPACE Architects, the upcoming building at 7000 N. Glenwood Avenue will also contain a 467-square foot party room with a 568-square foot exterior deck on the fifth floor.

Senior apartments envisioned for West Ridge's St. Scholastica Monastery,"In West Ridge, the Benedictine Sisters of Chicago are hoping a zone change will help sell a portion of its 14.5-acre St. Scholastica Monastery campus at 7430 N. Ridge Boulevard to a senior housing developer. No buyer has come forward, but real estate consultants working on behalf of the monastic Roman Catholic community believe a 3-acre piece of the property could support a four- to five-story independent living facility with between 80 and 100 apartments. The Benedictine Sisters have been in Chicago since the mid-1800s, but the group's numbers have declined. The sisters see the proposed independent living development as an opportunity to house its aging membership as well as other seniors living in the surrounding community. ""Our building at one point housed close to 200 women and now we're in the mid-20s and our median age is in the low 80s,"" said Sister Judith Murphy at a Monday night virtual community meeting hosted by Ald. Maria Hadden (49th). ""If we can find a developer to buy the property from us and build, own, and operate a senior housing facility ... It would be a win-win for us and the neighborhood."" A conceptual site plan prepared for the sisters by OKW Architects envisions the new structure at the north end of the St. Scholastica campus. The plan also calls for 134 parking spaces with primary vehicular access from Ridge Road but could include a western connection to Oakley Avenue.  The property's existing school, infirmary, and historic chapel would not be affected, but a two-story residential building and a community garden would be demolished. A portion of the running track along the western edge of the property will need to be realigned to make room for the proposed development. The site at 7430 N. Ridge is currently zoned for charitable educational/institutional uses under an existing Planned Development that would need to be amended to allow a senior living facility. The amendment would trigger the city's Affordable Requirement Ordinance and require any potential developer to provide a percentage of below-market-rate apartments.  The sisters hope to secure the zoning amendment from the city to help market the site to potential buyers. ""Once this additional use is added to this particular parcel, it will allow [the sisters] to start shopping around for developers,"" explained Ald. Hadden.  ""We're not considering any particular development right now, the details aren't there at this time,"" Hadden added. ""We are being asked to consider how we feel about allowing [the senior living] use on this property."" The alderwoman said her office will continue to collect feedback about the plan and will soon distribute an online survey to the community.  ",Rogers Park
Urbanize tours recently completed 3140 N. Clybourn,"Urbanize recently toured the newly completed mixed-use development at 3140 N. Clybourn. Planned by Range Group, the project occupies a formerly vacant parcel along N. Clybourn Ave south of the intersection of W. Belmont Ave and N. Western Ave.  Designed by Level Architecture, the five-story building is clad in dark corrugated metal with accents of aluminum metal paneling, creating texture and shadow on the facade. Balconies break up the facade and hang off the back elevation to provide outdoor space for select units. Starting our tour on the ground floor, the residential entry is located towards the northern side of the street frontage and includes a mail room and dedicated fitness center for tenants. The building features 3,100 square feet of ground floor retail space overlooking N. Clybourn Ave which is available for lease and is divisible. Bike parking and parking for 27 cars occupies the back of the ground floor. Heading up into the building, we next saw the outdoor amenity deck. Facing south, the roof deck offers extensive views of downtown and towards the lakefront. Residents will have access to the exterior space which includes seating and a large grilling station in addition to an interior amenity space with kitchenette.

Zoning application filed for Morgan Park Commons,"A zoning application has been filed for Morgan Park Commons, a proposed mixed-use development located at the northwest corner of W. 115th St and S. Halsted St. Addressed at 11420 S. Halsted, the new multi-phase development would be built on the 12-acre site of a former Jewel-Osco that has been vacant for over 16 years. Planned by the Far South Community Development Corporation, the site will be split up into multiple phases encompassing 258 residential units, 16,150 square feet of retail space, and a new 2.3-acre park with community center for the neighborhood.  Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the first phase will include two five-story mixed-use buildings. Topping out at 50 feet tall, the buildings will each have 42 apartments, 42 bike parking spaces, and 32 parking spaces. The buildings will front S. Halsted St, stretching from W. 114th St down to W. 115th St, separated by W. 114th Pl. Future phases will include more residential, the park, and a community center.

Approvals will be needed from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.  ",Roseland
Plan Commission adopts RLE transit development plan,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved and adopted the Red Line Extension (RLE) Transit-Supportive Development Plan. Conceived to help guide development around the upcoming Red Line Extension, the plan sets land use goals and expectations for new community and economic development anticipated as a result of the extension connecting the Far South neighborhoods to the CTA L network. With work underway on the design, the $3.6 billion Red Line Extension will extend the Red Line by 5.6 miles from the current 95th Street terminus down to 130th Street. With four new stations, the Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  The plan outlines four main goals which include increasing residential development variety and affordability; strengthening commercial, retail, and mixed-use development; enhancing public space and greater transportation access; and encouraging economic development, business, and employment generators. A market analysis has shown that this area’s population has been in decline for the last two decades and highlights the need for the Red Line Extension investment to help stabilize the surrounding neighborhoods and recover the lost population. With a land use strategy of development without displacement, the plan sets up an outline for balanced and responsible development to stabilize and increase the population. Strategies include investing in the community though rehabilitation, repair, and reuse of existing buildings; building new catalyst, mixed-use development on lots closest to the stations to spur additional investment; infill the neighborhood with new homes on vacant lots; and to build new mixed-use, commercial, and multifamily developments along major corridors. These options are not necessarily expected to be chronological but can happen at the same time. Envisioning development at each station, the 103rd St station would be seen as an active community hub with new mixed-use buildings next to the station while having a variety of multifamily residential buildings further away. DPD expects there to be the potential for 13,000 square feet of retail space, 800 new housing units, and $360 million in development potential. For the stop at 111th St, the area is being planned as a health and wellness district, with new mixed-use development near the station stepping down in scale as it gets deeper into the neighborhood and connecting to the Roseland Medical District near S. Michigan Ave. DPD expects this area to have a potential for 11,000 square feet of retail, 880 housing units, and $460 million in development potential. At Michigan Ave near 116th, the station area would be seen as a thriving commercial corridor. With the largest potential investment of $850 million, there would be multiple large, mixed-use developments near the station with a potential for 72,000 square feet of retail and 2,100 housing units. Down by Altgeld Gardens, the final station area at 130th is set to become a vibrant and connected community. With the CHA housing already in place, there isn’t as much room for economic development. DPD expects there could be 22,000 square feet of retail and just 55 housing units added to the area with a development potential of $37 million.  With adoption by the Chicago Plan Commission, the next steps for this plan will include attracting development to the key catalyst sites by DPD and implementing the economic development strategies. Going forward, this document will be the framework for development as DPD and CTA coordinate on the construction of the Red Line Extension.  CTA is looking to award the design/build construction contracts by the end of 2024 and begin construction in 2025. The Red Line Extension is targeting a 2029 completion. ",Roseland
Preliminary landmark approved for Greater Tabernacle Cathedral,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for the Greater Tabernacle Cathedral. Located at 11300 S. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the church was originally the Holy Rosary Catholic Church when it opened in 1890.  Meeting Criterion 1 for heritage, the church traces its origins back to the early settlement of Roseland and Pullman, which were linked economically and socially. The church was the first English-speaking Catholic parish in the area, serving a congregation of mostly Irish immigrants. The congregation flourished with hundreds of member families and by 1916 celebrated being free of their debts.  On March 4th, 1937, fire devastated the church and destroyed everything except for the exterior building structure and the bell tower, including all the interior artwork and ornamentation. The congregation rebuilt the church after the fire and the building has gone on to hold a total of three congregations - Holy Rosary Catholic Church, New Day Ministry International, and Greater Tabernacle Cathedral (since 2016). The building also meets Criterion 3 for its association with a significant person. From 1985-1988, Barack Obama led the Developing Communities Project as its executive director from its organization headquarters in the rectory of Greater Tabernacle Cathedral. As a faith-based organization, DCP was incorporated as a non-profit in 1986 under Obama’s lead and established programming to support the local community through job training, college preparation tutoring, and tenants' rights organizing for the Altgeld Gardens housing projects. With its Romanesque Revival design, the church also meets Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Designed by Solon S. Beman, the church is monumental yet restrained as it features limited ornamentation and its exterior is dominated by projecting cross gable roofs, monumental arched windows, and the juxtaposition between the red brick exterior and limestone base. The church is completed with a commanding bell tower that stands 85 feet tall.  In contrast to the design of the church, the rectory sits at the western end of the complex with an austere design that is absent of ornamentation. Rectangular in plan and two stories in height, the building is crowned by a cascading hipped roof and accentuated with prominent gable dormers and shed dormers. Clad in a dark brown brick, the facade is limited in ornamentation to just inset limestone blocks at gable ends, peaks of gabled dormers, and at gabled dormers as well as the simple relief work below the crown of chimneys on the west and south elevations. For its standing as a work of Solon S. Beman, the church also meets Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect. Beman was a renowned late 19th century and early 20th century architect who designed over 1,300 buildings in the company town of Pullman alone. Other notable works include the Fine Arts Building, Greenstone United Church, and many others. As it stands today, the church clearly retains its historic, architectural, and aesthetic integrity, allowing it to meet the separate Integrity Criterion. With staff recommending 1890 as its period of significance, changes from the 1960s will be outside of the period of significance as they aren’t consistent with the 19th century Romanesque qualities of the design by Beman. Changes include the update to the narthex which brought new interior finishes and new windows with mosaic tiles above the windows. The entrance also was revised with a stainless-steel canopy added alongside the installation of new doors and granite returns. With the preliminary landmark recommendation approved, the building’s significant features would be all exterior elevations including rooflines of the church and rectory buildings. Next steps include further review by landmarks staff before the commission votes on a final landmark recommendation to send the proposed designation to City Hall. There, the Committee on Zoning and City Council would need to vote on it before the church and rectory officially become Chicago landmarks. ",Roseland
CoD reviews Morgan Park Commons,"The Committee on Design has reviewed plans for Morgan Park Commons, a proposed mixed-use development located at the northwest corner of W. 115th St and S. Halsted St. Addressed at 11420 S. Halsted, the new multi-phase development would be built on the 12-acre site of a former Jewel-Osco that has been vacant for over 16 years. Planned by the Far South Community Development Corporation, the site will be split up into five phases encompassing 150 rental units, 136 townhomes, 18,750 square feet of retail space, and a new 3-acre park with fieldhouse for the neighborhood. Mixed-use apartment buildings will front the main streets of S. Halsted St and W. 115th St in the first two phases, with the third and fourth phases bringing the 136 townhomes. The three-acre park and fieldhouse are planned for the fifth phase, located along the Major Taylor Trail on the west side of the development site. With Lamar Johnson Collaborative on board for the design, the property has been split up with new roadways that will provide access to all of the townhomes and new park inside the large site. Two gateway plazas along S. Halsted St and W. 115th St will celebrate the entry into the development while offering larger spaces for pedestrians over cars. Within the development, streets have been designed as larger boulevards with green medians and more trees and planters. The discussion opened with Reed Kroloff, who questioned the strong axial street in the center of the site connecting east/west to S. Halsted St when there is already a street along the north boundary of the site. The architects responded that the northern street is being used as a service road, but Kroloff noted that it seems like there are a lot of internal streets and wondered if that center boulevard couldn’t be a great pedestrian avenue instead. The developer chimed in to agree that there could be some level of street elimination, but through the community process they added more parking and street access to appease the alderman and community concerns.   Hana Ishikawa commented next, saying that, in reality, most people will likely use that northern road to access the site. Southbound traffic would take it as the first access point while northbound traffic couldn’t use the access at the gateway plaza due to a median, resulting in a likely left turn into the north access point. Ishikawa also commented on the boulevards, calling them problematic due to their large dimension separating people. Additionally, Ishikawa saw the dead-end driveways as very confusing and could make it very hard to get in and out of the site.  Juan Moreno added his thoughts next, thinking that the boulevard should connect into a grander terminus at the park. Turning his attention to the preliminary concepts for the first phase buildings, Moreno commented that the residential entries are getting lost due to the prominence of the retail spaces. Additionally, Moreno commented that the team should spend more time on the back elevation of the buildings to ensure they don’t feel like the back side as they face the rest of the development.  Brian Lee joined the conversation next, noting that the circulation should be diminishing as you get closer to the buildings, and that boulevards can be very dividing. Lee also questioned whether the park should be completed in Phase 1 rather than Phase 5 to help attract residents to the development with that amenity from the start.  John Ronan was the last committee member to comment, beginning by applauding the initiative of building affordable housing. Ronan questioned why the plan departed abruptly in scale from the surrounding context and neglected to continue the urban grid into the parcel. Ronan commented that the taller height of the perimeter buildings gave a fortress-like reading.  The developer responded that the roadway design was based on the existing access points to the site and went the way of the existing fabric after engaging in conversations with CDOT regarding extending the existing streets into the site. In regard to the change in scale, the developer commented that this housing type was chosen due to the lack of it in the neighborhood and the effort to diversify housing in the neighborhood. Ronan closed off his comments by saying that they need to be careful, because if he described a development with larger buildings along the main corridors and shorter townhomes in between, he could be describing Cabrini-Green. Ronan urged that he doesn’t want new development to be making the same mistakes again.  As the development progresses, Far South CDC will need to amend the existing Planned Development on the site. Indicating future approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. A timeline for the development has not been made public. ",Roseland
CoD reviews Roseland Community Medical District ,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the proposed Roseland Community Medical District. Planned for the Roseland neighborhood, the scope of the master plan is bounded by S. Eggleston Ave to the west, W. 110th St to the north, S. Edbrooke Ave to the east, and W. 112th St to the south.  The project is being put together by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the Far South CDC, the Greater Roseland Chamber of Commerce, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, Applied Real Estate Analysis, and Johnson & Lee Architects.     Planned for a 95-acre region, the plan looks to create a catalytic investment and drive foot traffic to the historic Michigan Ave commercial corridor. Situated within an existing urban neighborhood, the district will reinvest in the community and improve access to healthcare for the community. Working with the CTA, the plan will consider and incorporate the future Red Line extension. With the current trend in healthcare focusing away from large, new hospitals, the district envisions new outpatient care for the neighborhood. The need for mixed-use programming is heavily weighted on outpatient goods and services for the support of healthy lifestyles. The plan looks to drive residential infill based on revitalization via the medical investments. The current plan has identified the intention of the Roseland Community Hospital to build a new surgery center and child birthing space above the existing emergency room. The concept also looks to develop an outpatient campus on three large sites at the intersection of W. 111th St and S. State St.  Planned to move forward through an RFP process, the phased development would include multiple buildings that step up in height to the corner. Medical buildings will line the main street frontages, while the interior of each parcel would be used for community programming including potential supportive housing or community center space. The two programs will be split by an interior spine of green space outdoors. The project also identified the Gately People’s Gas site at 112th and Michigan for redevelopment. As part of the larger plan, this redevelopment could aid in triggering infill development across the entire district.  The discussion opened with comments from Lesley Roth. Roth noticed the housing component and noted that there are many community organizations that are working to infill vacant sites with housing currently and the character of the streets are diverse, and the opportunity can carry more than single-family homes. Roth asked why housing is needed in the medical master plan rather than allowing community organizations to work in tandem to have a broader impact on the neighborhood.  The project team responded that the housing component came out of service providers needing housing within a certain distance of their facility and will focus on adult and youth behavioral supportive housing. With so much opportunity for housing infill, the district goes far beyond just medical space and will partner with those service providers to help fund and deliver housing infill.  Renauld Mitchell jumped in to say that there is a tremendous synergy between housing services and behavioral/mental health services. Mitchell said that they are sold and convinced of that connection.  Hana Ishikawa encouraged the design team to look at how the green sponges can feel more like campus connectors and whether they could be brought out to the public way. Ishikawa mentioned how interior courtyards can tend to not be as occupied as we would like them to and figuring a way to make sure it feels more like their space could improve the outdoor space on site. The project team responded that the design of the interior connector was based on the community concerns around safety and while the main investment is along the exterior, they also want to retain a safe passageway through the project. The team is looking to wrap up the plan by this June to begin the implementation later this year.  ",Roseland
Downtown Skokie's new tallest building comes together,"Work on downtown Skokie's tallest building is progressing at a rapid pace with a new developer at the helm of the 12-story project under construction at 8000 N. Lincoln Avenue. Known simply as 8000 North, the upcoming $70 million complex features 153 high-end rental units offered in studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom floorplans. There's also an off-street motorcourt fronting Oakton Street, ground-floor retail space, and a parking garage the development shares with the Village of Skokie. Murphy Development Group took over the stalled project last year from a joint venture of Greenspire Capital and Hoffman Homes. The prior development team broke ground on 8000 North in the first part of 2018 but encountered a permit-related delay followed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the site's construction crane coming down. While only the foundation and adjacent parking garage were complete when Murphy took control of the project last fall, the Skokie development has advanced considerably since then. When we went by the site this month, the structure had reached its full height and crews were busy installing precast facade panels that had arrived via flatbed truck. Designed by Chicago architecture firm Lucien Lagrange Studio, 8000 North has a more traditional appearance compared to many recent apartment developments. The beige concrete exterior is meant to look like stone blocks and features teal architecturalal flourishes—similar to Lucien Lagrange's Sixty West Erie tower in River North. John Murphy, chairman and CEO of Murphy Development Group, told Crain's that he expects work on the upcoming apartment complex at 8000 N. Lincoln Avenue to wrap-up later this year or in early 2022.   ",Skokie
Site plan approval secured for first building at Riverline,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has granted site plan approval for the first building to be constructed at Riverline. Developed by CMK Companies, the project will be located at 1010 S. Wells along the South Branch of the Chicago River. With Gensler behind the updated design, the 21-story tower will stand 227 feet tall. As part of the redesign, the building has shifted from 286 condos to 386 apartments. The building’s parking count has been reduced from 240 spaces to 182 parking spaces. The building will include 2,904 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.  As part of the redesign, the liner units on the podium have been substituted for building amenities and parking areas. The ground floor facades are proposed to remain with extensive full-height prefinished aluminum glass window system while the parking above ground level will be screened with multi-colored, perforated metal panels. The bulk of the residential tower will be clad in glass and aluminum window wall with a corrugated metal paneling cladding the mechanical penthouse at the top of the building.  The proposal will have its retail, residential, and vehicular access all off of S. Wells St as previously approved. The retail and parking entries have been pulled back to emphasize a tall, fully glazed residential lobby and to define an entry plaza at Wells and Taylor Street. The site will include a section of public riverwalk along the banks of the Chicago River and will be accessed via two access paths that run along the north and south sides of the building through open landscaped areas. A dog run will be included for residents. With site plan approval secured, the developer can move forward with permitting and construction on the project. While permits have been filed and are undergoing review, a timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",South Loop
Lendlease achieves stabilization at The Reed at Southbank,"Lendlease recently announced the stabilization of the apartments at The Reed at Southbank, the firm’s 41-story residential tower at 234 W. Polk St. in Chicago’s South Loop neighborhood. The rental units are now 95% occupied since the property welcomed its first residents last summer. Located along the Chicago River immediately south of the Loop, The Reed is the second high-rise completed in the 7-acre Southbank master plan. The property includes 226 apartments in a mix of studio, convertible, one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans, in addition to 214 condominiums on the upper floors. This hybrid model provides flexible living options and allows for a wider range of shared amenities for all residents. “Renters have gravitated to The Reed’s exceptional amenities, industrial-modern design and unparalleled location along the riverfront, steps from the heart of downtown,” said Andrew Trickett, Managing Director, Investment Management, Lendlease. “These characteristics not only help create an incomparable living experience for our residents, but they are also the foundation for creating valuable assets to support our investment management strategy.” Designed by Perkins&WIll, apartments at The Reed feature 9-foot exposed concrete ceilings, wide-plank wood flooring and full-height windows showcasing views of the downtown skyline, adjacent Southbank Park and Chicago River. Select units also include balconies.

City Council approves mixed-use development at 2328 S. Michigan,"The Chicago City Council has approved a mixed-use development located at 2328 S. Michigan. Planned by Fern Hill, the project site is located midblock between E. 23rd St and E. 24th St. The property previously held a Burger King that is surrounded by a vacant surface parking lot. Designed by Eckenhoff Saunders, the design splits the development into two massings on the front and back of the site. Along the street, the seven-story massing has been broken down, splitting the 175-foot-long frontage into three parts that are complementary in width and scale to surrounding buildings as part of the historic Motor Row District. The facades are clad in materials similar in tone to the district but not matching, including terracotta toned masonry, white glazed brick, and tan toned brick. On the back portion of the site, an 18-story midrise will rise approximately 170 feet tall. The volume was setback from the street to avoid being visible from within the historic district. The tower was designed to be neutral with an aluminum curtain wall, metal slab edge covers, and glass spandrel panels. The development will have 256 residential units with a unit mix of 88 studios, 136 one-beds, 32 two-beds. The project has 64 affordable units accounting for 25% of the units. The development is one of the first projects to take advantage of the floor area bonus under the Connected Communities ordinance where developers can swap parking spaces for affordable housing. The affordable units will be split into 22 studios, 34 one-beds, and 8 two-beds.  On the ground floor, the project fronts S. Michigan Ave with 3,000 square feet of retail space with the residential entry at the south end of the building’s frontage. 16 residential units will face an internal courtyard that separates the two massings. Ten parking spaces will be located along the alley with two loading spaces. 256 bike parking spaces will be provided in a bike room between the residential lobby and loading dock.  With City Council approval secured, the site will be rezoned from DS-5 to DX-5 with a Planned Development designation. The project will pay $1.66 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to receive a 3.1 FAR bonus and a 0.31 FAR bonus will be taken from the parking swap. With the project approved, the developers will turn their attention to securing financing for the $110 million development. Construction will begin as soon as financing is secured.  ",South Loop

1000M celebrates grand opening,"Developers Time Equities, JK Equities, and Oak Capitals recently celebrated the grand opening of 1000M. Located at 1000 S. Michigan in downtown Chicago’s Historic Michigan Boulevard District across from Grant Park, the 73-story tower was designed by the late, legendary architect Helmut Jahn to embrace famed views of the park and of Chicago’s world-renowned skyline along Lake Michigan. “More than 10 years ago, Helmut Jahn and I began discussing our vision for an innovative, iconic residential tower here at 1000 S. Michigan Ave.,” said Francis Greenburger, Chairman and CEO of Time Equities. “Needless to say, we are thrilled with the result – it was certainly a labor of love. We could not have done this without the tireless commitment from the development team, Jahn, Kara Mann Design, Willow Bridge Properties and McHugh Construction.” With vistas top of mind, Jahn’s elegant glass-and-steel exterior for 1000M, as well as the building’s orientation, provides the opportunity for residents to look upon Chicago’s best natural assets – its lakefront and parks – and its architectural diversity. “The concept for 1000M is based on using the functions within to create a bold architectural statement on the skyline, while being responsive to contextual influences,” said Philip Castillo, FAIA, managing director of Jahn. “The curving façade and building height optimize views of the city, park, and Museum Campus. The footprint for the residential floors cantilevers to the south to capture breathtaking lake and city vistas. 1000M really is designed to celebrate Chicago’s distinct beauty and contribute to the city’s architectural legacy.” 1000M features 738 apartments with gracious floorplans, abundant natural light and extraordinary views. Current monthly rents start at $2,080 for studios; $2,400 for convertibles; $3,100 for one-bedrooms; $5,100 for two-bedrooms; $9,500 for three-bedrooms; and $16,000 for four-bedroom penthouses. Each home boasts 9-foot ceilings, oversized windows, premium plank flooring and light-filtering roller shades. Kitchens include custom soft-close wood cabinetry, under cabinet lighting, Caesarstone countertops, and built-in paneled refrigerators and dishwashers. Bathrooms include Calcutta Gold and Marquina porcelain tile, mirrors with integrated lighting and high-design glass shower doors. The building boasts 80,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities that span seven floors and feature spectacular views. On levels 3 and 4, a 10,000-plus square-foot health club offers state-of-the-art cardio, strength, circuit and H.I.I.T. training equipment; a basketball half-court; spin studio; personal training rooms; yoga rooms; massage/treatment rooms and more. An indoor lap pool and whirlpool are on level 8. Across levels 8 and 20 are a mix of sophisticated, comfortable, entertainment-ready social lounges, many with outdoor terrace access. They include gathering areas for relaxing and dining, fireplaces, libraries, a baby grand piano, wet bars, and easy access to chef’s demonstration or catering kitchens, but each lounge has a distinct identity. The Cocktail Lounge, for example, recalls Chicago’s famous speakeasies, while the Billiards Lounge and Arcade, Children’s Art and Playroom, and the Game Room offer entertainment such as foosball, shuffleboard and air hockey for adults or children. A golf simulator is housed in its own space. Also on level 8 is an expansive outdoor sundeck with loungers, cabanas, a social garden, al fresco dining, grilling stations, and a heated pool for three-season use. On level 10, an Art Gallery leads to a Zen Garden overlooking the pool, with lounge seating, firepits, dining areas and grilling stations. Coworking on level 21 offers communal and independent workspaces, coffee bars and print stations, private offices and booths, collaboration pods, and video-enabled conference rooms. The double-height lounge on level 73, scheduled to be completed in early fall, will showcase the tower’s signature amenity space: an open-air terrace with unparalleled lake, park and skyline views from what will be the highest residential observation deck in the city. Behind the open-air terrace will be the Wintergarden, a large social space flooded year-round with natural light. A reservable dining room with demonstration kitchen and jaw-dropping vistas will provide tenants with an intimate special occasion venue. With McHugh Construction serving as the general contractor, the $435 million tower first welcomed residents on May 1st and is already one-third leased. ",South Loop

Renovation permit issued for affordable housing at 1801 S. Wabash,"A renovation permit has been issued for the rehabilitation of an existing residential building into affordable apartments at 1801 S. Wabash. Located at the southeast corner of S. Wabash Ave and E. 18th St, the redevelopment is being led by Mercy Housing. With Nia Architects serving as the architect, the existing building will have no significant changes to the building structure, but the interior will be renovated and reconfigured with a new interior layout. The ground floor will hold the in-house management offices, a residential lobby, package room, an activity room, a recreation room, and a fitness center. The building will be converted into 100 studio units that will be fully affordable. Behind the building, the courtyard will get new amenities including a playground and bike storage. The entirely affordable project will be income-restricted to an average of 60% AMI. The City Council approved the rezoning of the site from DX-5 and DR-3 to a unified DR-5 with an overall Planned Development designation back in July 2023.  With the renovation permit issued for the construction, general contractor Ujamaa Construction can begin work on converting the building.  ",South Loop
Lendlease receives site plan approval for next phase of Southbank,"Australian developer Lendlease has received site plan approval for its next tower at the larger Southbank development. Planned at 680 S. Wells, the developer is acquiring a narrow parcel between the original Southbank property and the Alta Grand Central residential towers to its northeast. That parcel will be incorporated into the new design and masterplan for the project. Designed by FitzGerald, the 40-story residential tower will rise 430 feet and overlook Southbank Park and the Chicago River. On the ground floor, the residential entry will be accessed at the northeast corner of the building along S. Wells St, with the retail entrance on the southeast corner. A private drive will occupy the newly added parcel and include a drop-off zone in front of the residential entry as well as access to the loading dock and parking access on the west side of the building. Above the ground floor, the podium will hold a number of parking floors to accommodate the planned 239 car parking spaces. 120 bike parking spaces are also included. Above the podium, the residential portion of the tower will rise above, accommodating 531 residential units featuring balconies and an alternating metal panel facade design. With the site plan approval secured, the project can continue moving forward. A permit for the new construction has been filed and is currently under review. The project’s situation is complicated by the fact that Lendlease recently announced that they will be pulling out of development projects outside of their home country of Australia, putting Southbank and other projects up for sale. A timeline for the acquisition of the project and then future construction is completely up in the air.  ",South Loop
Affordable housing at 1800 S. Michigan scores permit,"A full building permit has been issued for affordable housing at 1800 S. Michigan. Planned by Mercy Housing, the project site is a vacant lot located at the southwest corner of the intersection of S. Michigan Ave and E. 18th St.  With Nia Architects in charge of the design, the new residential building at 1800 S. Michigan will stand five stories tall, set to deliver 50 affordable residential units.

Residential conversion at 739 S. Clark scores permit,"A renovation permit has been issued for a planned office to residential conversion at 739 S. Clark. Planned by CMK Companies, the existing office building was part of the Imprint development completed just before the COVID-19 pandemic. The three-story commercial building was reclad and listed for office leases but got no tenants as a result of the pandemic.  Designed by Osterhaus McCarthy Architects, the conversion will renovate the interior of the structure and add 68 apartments. In the basement, the conversion will provide tenant storage and 68 new bike parking spaces, but no new car parking will be added.

Bears release plans for $4.7B stadium project in Chicago,"The Chicago Bears yesterday unveiled their plans to build a new domed stadium along the lakefront at a price of $4.7 billion. Planned to be located just south of Soldier Field, the enclosed stadium allows for more events while the larger site overall would be reconfigured to include 14 acres of athletic fields and recreational park space for use by public and youth sports programs. The athletic fields would provide a high-quality, safe place for the city's youth, especially those from nearby underserved neighborhoods, to gather and play sports. Visitors would be able to enjoy the lakefront via indoor and outdoor experiences. The plan features a three-acre promenade and plaza area which could include year-round food and beverage outlets, retail shops, a cultural attraction focused on sports and Soldier Field history.  A publicly-owned hotel could also be included on the recreation and cultural campus. Designed by Manica Architecture, the proposal includes a contemporary architectural design which complements the existing architecture featuring an enclosed, fixed roof with spectacular views of Chicago's skyline and lakefront as well as intimate seating for unparalleled sight lines and open spaces for congregating. The stadium would be capable of hosting large-scale sporting events year-round, including Super Bowls and NCAA Final Fours as well as the world's most prominent entertainment acts. Those spectacles would unlock economic benefits for a variety of sectors within Chicago and the region. Other project features include a pedestrian mall and pavilion, a wider variety of food and beverage options, more public restrooms, and the preservation of Soldier Field's historic colonnades, which will remain accessible to fans and continue to honor the men and women who served in our nation's military. The plan also involves the easing of traffic circulation in the area by creating improved ramps and interchanges at 18th Street, by building a new parking deck built on an existing surface lot, creating improved access to DuSable Lake Shore Drive via a new overpass, relocation of a Lake Shore Drive exit and new ramps to the campus, and a new lower level for McFetridge Drive. The changes are expected to result in a 50% increase in campus capacity for events, a 10- to 20-minute reduction in event exit times, and 1,200 vehicle hours of congestion removed on an average day at the intersection of DuSable Lake Shore Drive and McFetridge Drive.  The Bears have pledged to contribute more than $2 billion to the project—over 70% of the total stadium cost. The remaining stadium funds are proposed to come from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA), a government entity that was created by the Illinois General Assembly in 1987 for the purpose of constructing and renovating sports stadiums for professional teams in the state of Illinois. The Bears' proposal can be accomplished with the existing 2% hotel tax used to back ISFA bonds. Set to cost approximately $1.5 billion, the infrastructure plan for the project is split into three phases. Phase 1 consists of requirements to open the stadium including transportation, roadways and utilities, and would cost an estimated $325 million. Phase 2 would maximize the stadium and surrounding campus, cost $510 million and include a bus depot expansion, new parks and playfields. Phase 3 would further enhance the campus, cost $665 million and consist of additional transportation improvements, retail and public attractions. While there will be a long road ahead of review and approvals, The Bears are aiming to break ground in the summer of 2025, with a planned grand opening in the summer of 2028. ",South Loop

On the ground floor, retail space would front S. Michigan Ave with the residential lobby at the southern end of the street frontage. As a unique design feature, 16 residential units on the ground floor would face an internal courtyard. Just 10 car parking spaces would be accessed from the alley with a bike room near the residential entry that would have capacity for 256 bikes.  Set to rise 170 feet tall, the building would be split into two massings on the front and back of the site. Along the street, a seven-story massing would be designed to look like multiple brick buildings joined by a glass and metal volume in the center. The rear volume would be an 18-story glass and metal tower.  With the zoning application filed, the developer is seeking to rezone the site from DS-5 to DX-5 with an overall Planned Development. They would also pay into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to receive a 3.1 FAR bonus. Approvals will be needed from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council.

Melrose Ascension Capital and QIP land financing for 633 S. LaSalle,"Melrose Ascension Capital and Q Investment Partners have the closing of construction financing for 633 S. LaSalle, a residential development in South Loop. Already under construction, QIP and MAC joined forces to reposition and revamp the legacy scheme, previously acquired from PMG and The Collective.  The project was made possible following a US$63.7 million construction loan, syndicated between Glacier Global Partners, BH3 Management, & Petros PACE Finance, and equity provided by private investors and Bank Julius Baer. “We’re excited to announce the full capitalization and development of this project, having broken ground in 2023,” said Nick Melrose, Founder & CEO of Melrose Ascension Capital. “Despite the current market challenges and construction pricing environment, our dedicated project teams have brought this to fruition, which is a testament to our partnership with QIP, and our entire valued project team, including Clark Construction, FitzGerald Associates, and Common Living. We also have great coactive lending partners in Glacier, BH3, and Petros that were instrumental in bringing this project to fruition.” Designed by FitzGerald, the residential building will rise 17 stories, comprising 358 total beds in a mix of studios, convertibles, two-beds, three-beds, and four-bedroom apartments. Featuring a diverse mix of fully furnished bedrooms and living spaces in some units, alongside traditional, unfurnished apartments, the project appeals to a wide range of prospective tenants with cost-effective, Class A housing. With rents starting at $1,650, residents will have access to expansive rooftop amenities (including a fitness center, lounge, game room, and private event space), an outdoor pool and terrace, and ground floor co-working space for residents.  Slated for completion in Q4 2024, this most recent undertaking underscores the start of a programmatic collaboration between QIP and MAC to deliver high-quality investment opportunities amidst challenging market conditions, but also QIP’s commitment to strengthening its expansion and development capabilities in the US. Clark Construction is serving as the general contractor for the construction. “The US real estate market is a very important piece of QIP’s real estate growth strategy,” commented Peter Young, CEO of QIP. “As QIP develops its multifamily housing investment development & operational capability and establishes its position as a leading player in the private equity real estate investment sector, this partnership with MAC offers an opportunity to further build out our global residential living sector platform across the US, the UK, and Japan.” ",South Loop
Related Midwest releases further renderings of White Sox stadium at The 78,"Developer Related Midwest has shared further renderings of the potential new White Sox stadium at The 78 site. Urbanize recently shared a first look at renderings of the potential stadium as Related Midwest engages in negotiations with the White Sox about the possibility of them building a new stadium on the 62-acre South Loop property. The additional new conceptual renderings show the proposed stadium structure anchoring the high-rise district. With home plate at the southwest corner, the stadium wraps around the field primarily on the west and south sides, offering expansive views of downtown beyond including the Sears Tower. A new public plaza will be located to the north of the stadium, with a large video screen facing the terraced park.  The renderings show the Wells-Wentworth Connector reconfigured to bend around the stadium, with a new public plaza along the Chicago River. A newly configured series of towers rise around the stadium, likely a mix of office and residential uses. The Discovery Partners Institute will be integrated into the new configuration at the south end of the site. Earlier in 2023, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the White Sox, was considering a move from Guaranteed Rate Field as their lease ends after the 2029 season. Further reporting since our last article indicates that Related Midwest and the White Sox have had meetings with Mayor Johnson and state representatives regarding the future of this proposal and potential public funding. Alderman Pat Dowell, whose ward includes The 78, has put out a statement indicating a positive outlook on the project but withholding final judgment until more details come to light.  As the White Sox look to move closer to downtown, the future of Guaranteed Rate Field and the sea of parking lots around it are in question. While they do not own the land at 35th & Shields, Related Midwest has a long history of working in communities and has put together conceptual ideas for the property. Any redevelopment of the area would be subject to a robust community process to determine the best use for the land.   ",South Loop

Renderings emerge for potential White Sox stadium at The 78,"Renderings have surfaced for a potential new White Sox stadium at The 78 site. Recent reports have brought to light the fact that the White Sox are negotiating with developer Related Midwest about the possibility of building a new stadium on the 62-acre South Loop property. Originally approved as a multi-tower, mixed-use megadevelopment in 2020, the new conceptual renderings show the proposed stadium structure anchoring the high-rise district. With home plate at the southwest corner, the stadium wraps around the field primarily on the west and south sides, with a large video screen overlooking a large plaza to the north.  The renderings show the Wells-Wentworth Connector reconfigured to bend around the stadium, with a new public plaza along the Chicago River. A newly configured series of towers rise around the stadium, likely a mix of office and residential uses. The Discovery Partners Institute building can be seen in the largest scale overall rendering at the south end of the site. Earlier in 2023, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the White Sox, was considering a move from Guaranteed Rate Field as their lease ends after the 2029 season. While the future of the team’s home is unclear, the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which owns and financed Guaranteed Rate Field, has reportedly not been involved in the discussions. The megadevelopment by Related Midwest has stalled with nothing moving forward on the site as of yet. The Discovery Partners Institute would be the first tenant of the large parcel, with their building set to break ground this year. As the developer continues its search for funding and users, landing the White Sox would be a shot in the arm for moving the development forward. Efforts to develop the city’s first casino on the property fell through when former Mayor Lightfoot chose Bally’s proposal at the former Tribune site. ",South Loop

City Council approves new Epic Academy facility,"The Chicago City Council has approved a new school facility for Epic Academy. Located at 8231 S. South Shore, the new school will occupy the former St. Michael’s school building and see the construction of an addition on its north side, replacing two residential properties. To the south, a one-story auxiliary building and three-story convent will be demolished. With the goal of creating a state-of-the-art school, architects JGMA have led the design process using the history and the past as a springboard for the future. Their design holds the former school in high regard while creating a new experience for the students with the new four-story addition on the north side of the building. The new addition includes a new entry to connect with the community and underscore the new feeling for students. Programmatically, the addition holds spaces that will connect the school with the community and families, while most of the classrooms will stay in the original building. The gymnasium has been elevated to the top of the building to bring people up and connect with the community while capitalizing on the view as an amenity.  With the new addition designed in the round, all facades will be clad in a terracotta rainscreen system that adds a vertical rhythm inspired by the existing building. As it presents itself to the neighborhood and the students, the new building entry is inset at an angle, creating a dynamic new entry space. Considering sustainability, the building will meet LEED Silver or better in addition to other strategies to meet the city’s sustainable development requirements. Strategies include exceeding energy code, providing solar panels on the roof, exceeding the stormwater ordinance, planting trees, installing green roofs, reducing the indoor water use, providing bike parking, including bird protection, and being in proximity to transit. The project is currently in the design development phase, with acquisition of the site contingent on the now-approved zoning change. Due to significant water infiltration, roofers will be brought in to stabilize the building as soon as possible. While the fundraising process is still ongoing, the school hopes to be in the building by 2024 or 2025. ",South Shore
Plan Commission approves Epic Academy,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved a new school facility for Epic Academy. Located at 8231 S. South Shore, the new school will occupy the former St. Michael’s school building and see the construction of an addition on its north side, replacing two residential properties. To the south, a one-story auxiliary building and three-story convent will be demolished. With the goal of creating a state-of-the-art school, architects JGMA have led the design process using the history and the past as a springboard for the future. Their design holds the former school in high regard while creating a new experience for the students with the new four-story addition on the north side of the building. The new addition includes a new entry to connect with the community and underscore the new feeling for students.

CDC approves TIF for Thrive Exchange,"The Community Development Commission has approved $10.2 million in TIF funding and a land sale for Thrive Exchange, a mixed-use development planned for 7901 S. Exchange. As the winner of a recent Invest South/West RFP, the project will reactivate the intersection at the 79th St Metra stop. Planned by DL3 Realty, the commission solely considered the southern building out of the multi-building plan. Designed by KOO, the project will encompass a six-story mixed-use building topping out at 76 feet with a new landscaped plaza. The development will deliver 43 affordable workforce housing units renting at 60% AMI, split into 4 studios, 20 one-beds, and 19 two-beds. Unit rents will average $960/month for studios, $1,075/month for one-beds, and $1,295 for two-beds. The ground floor of the building will also hold retail space as well as an office space for Neighborhood Housing Services. Through the design process, massing options studied included a low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise building for the site. The current design reflects the mid-rise option, allowing for small green spaces on the ground floor while creating enough density to activate the area. A retail plaza will face the Metra tracks and the intersection, with a tenant amenity deck on the second floor overlooking it. Residents will access the building off S. Exchange Ave with a dedicated bike room entry also along the west side. Residents will park on a surface lot holding 45 spaces along the Metra tracks before entering through a rear door. The facade is drawn from the context of the Ringer Building, with choices selected to complement its materiality. A warm brick mix will be paired with copper metal panels at the window and lower recessed spaces. The arched openings draw from the arches at the Ringer Building.  The $26.3 million project will be funded with a $2.5 million 1st mortgage, $10.2 million in TIF funding, $2.6 million in multifamily loans from the Chicago Recovery Plan, a $170,000 ComEd energy grant, $10.6 million in LIHTC equity, and a $100,000 deferred developer fee. With the parcel at 7909 S. Exchange currently owned by the city, the commission has also approved the sale of the one parcel for $1. With the Community Development Commission’s approval of the proposed TIF funding and land sale, the project can move forward with drafting a redevelopment agreement with the city. The developers will need approval from the City Council to receive the TIF funding and land conveyance. The $10.2 million TIF financing would be split into three payments of $3.4 million paid out at 33%, 66% and 100% completion of the building. ",South Shore
Regal Mile Studios breaks ground,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined city, community, and business leaders at a groundbreaking ceremony for Regal Mile Studios. Located at 7700 S. Stony Island, The Regal Mile Studios Campus 1 is a 380,000 square foot, seven-acre enclosed media campus and sound stage development planned by Loop Capital Real Estate Partners.  “Through this $100M investment to develop a new, state-of-the-art media campus in the South Shore neighborhood, INVEST South/West will expand educational opportunities for young people and equip them with the skills they need to thrive and succeed in the film and media industry,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “I am thrilled that this project not only puts community voices front and center, but also enhances Chicago’s presence in the entertainment industry. Ultimately, this development will support our South Side residents and contribute to our prosperous, post-pandemic recovery.”   Designed by Bauer Latoza Studio, the development will include three film studios, office space, staging areas, and 95 parking spaces. The triangular site will be composed of three areas. The first is the main studio parcel, holding the three mains studio and office structures. Two other smaller parcels include the northwest parking lot and a smaller parcel south of the parking lot that will have a green room, which is a prep area for actors.  The main site is organized around a central internal portion that acts as open flex space, offering an internal outdoor yard for staging and access for staff. Placed around this central area, three studio buildings each measure 20,000 sf with 40 feet interior clear height space for filming and set building. Located out from the studio structures are attached office spaces. Rising 28 feet, the two-story portions will face the street, blocking views of the taller 52-feet tall studio enclosures. The office portions are faced with lively facades that face the neighborhood.  All three elevations facing the surrounding streets will be treated with the same architectural expression. The facade is a vibrant pattern of form and color that takes cues from street art and filmstrips. The resulting vibrant linear design is present on all three frontages using metal paneling as the material.  With approvals coming back in 2021, construction will now begin and is set to complete for a Fall 2024 occupancy.  ",South Shore
Developers plan 22-story tower at 7162 S. Exchange,"Developers Model of Transformation Design and Development have proposed a mixed-use tower at 7162 S. Exchange. Currently a vacant lot, the project site is located at the northwestern corner of S. Exchange Ave and E. 72nd St. The site, which was once home to the Food Exchange supermarket, overlooks the South Shore Metra stop and is down the street from the South Shore Cultural Center. The 22-story mixed-use tower is set to hold 153 residential units, with 80% of them planned to be market-rate and the remaining 20% set aside as affordable. Residents will be able to choose from one-bed, two-bed, and three-bed configurations. The base of the building will include 15,000 square feet of ground floor retail space with 100 car parking spaces above. Tenants will have access to amenities including a swimming pool, rooftop restaurant, and rooftop deck. With JGMA in charge of the design, the vision for the project is intended to raise the bar of what development should look like in the South Shore neighborhood. Designed to serve as an anchor for the neighborhood while bringing new architectural and cultural vision to the community, the building will feature an iconic wrapping façade that integrates the base of the building, twisting up through the tower where it eventually meets the top overhang. The dynamic façade creates a series of sculptural colored balconies with unobstructed views of the city’s lakefront and downtown.  In the early stages of planning, the developers are pursuing zoning approval from the city while pursuing funding. Estimated to cost $61 million, the developers are seeking funding through the Chicago Recovery Grant program as well as by pursuing state capital grants, clean energy financing, community investments, and crowdfunding.

Thrive Exchange presented to Committee on Design,"The Committee on Design has reviewed Thrive Exchange, a mixed-use development planned for 7901 S. Exchange. As the winner of a recent Invest South/West RFP, the project will reactivate the intersection at the 79th St Metra stop and benefits from the new eTOD ordinance recently passed by City Council. Planned by DL3 Realty, the team presented solely the southern building out of the multi-building plan. Designed by KOO, the project will encompass a six-story mixed-use building topping out at 76 feet with a new landscaped plaza. The development will deliver 43 affordable workforce housing units renting at 60% AMI, split into 4 studios, 20 one-beds, and 19 two-beds. Unit rents will average $960/month for studios, $1,075/month for one-beds, and $1,295 for two-beds. The ground floor of the building will also hold retail space as well as an office space for Neighborhood Housing Services. Through the design process, massing options studied included a low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise building for the site. The current design reflects the mid-rise option, allowing for small green spaces on the ground floor while creating enough density to activate the area. A retail plaza will face the Metra tracks and the intersection, with a tenant amenity deck on the second floor overlooking it. Residents will access the building off S. Exchange Ave with a dedicated bike room entry also along the west side. Residents will park on a surface lot holding 45 spaces along the Metra tracks before entering through a rear door. The facade is drawn from the context of the Ringer Building, with choices selected to complement its materiality. A warm brick mix will be paired with copper metal panels at the window and lower recessed spaces. The arched openings draw from the arches at the Ringer Building.  Addressing the pedestrian experience of the busy corner, the currently wide intersection will be condensed to expand sidewalks and create a colorfully integrated plaza. The plaza speaks to bringing people and activity to the site, with a pocket park on the west side of the building for residents and increased sidewalk planters to increase the desirability of being a pedestrian here. The discussion began with Jeanne Gang who asked whether there could be more permeable surfaces in the landscaping to allow for more space around trees to increase comfort through the urban tree canopy. The team from KOO commented that it is certainly something to consider because there are not a lot of large scale, shade providing trees, so they will look at doing less planters and more green surface areas as they progress with the design.  The next member, Andre Brumfield, asked whether the flex space adjacent to the plaza would be used for future retail or a different use. The developers commented that the space is a work-in-progress and is currently seen as a quasi-public amenity space. The community is looking for gathering space and they are working with the management company to make the decision on what the space would be. If it is not used as community space it would become more retail space. Maria Villalobos chimed in next to further Jeanne’s comment by asking about moving the parking further south so a line of trees could be added along the walkway to the building. The developers responded that they have to work within a 15-foot setback from Metra property, but they also want more trees in open green space rather than small planters. Committee member Eleanor Gorski commended the team on preserving the adjacent historic building and liked the fact that the new building was pulled away from the corner to give more visual connection to the Ringer Building. Catherine Baker chimed in to comment that she felt the selection of brick was a surprising move and added a level of texture and detail that she found to be wonderful. Baker encouraged the design team to fight through the value engineering process to keep the brick.  While exact details are not available, the project may need to undergo a rezoning process. Developers will also need approvals for acquiring the city-owned land and settling on a redevelopment agreement. A timeline for approvals and construction has not been announced. ",South Shore
Thrive Exchange selected as winner for South Shore Invest S/W RFP,"As part of the two-year anniversary of Invest South/West, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the winners of three more RFP’s, including the South Shore RFP. This RFP, as well as the other two, were selected from a pool of developer responses that came after the RFP’s were announced in April by the Department of Planning and Development (DPD). Developed as a joint venture between DL3 Realty, Revere Properties, and Claretian, Thrive Exchange was selected as the winner out of two submissions. Designed by KOO, the proposal is planned for multiple sites adjacent to the Cheltenham station on Metra Electric’s Main Line located near the intersection of E. 79th Street and S. Exchange Avenue.  The $47.3 million development will produce a mixed-use project, creating 39 residential units on the south side of E. 79th Street in a new building. The historic Ringer Building will be converted into commercial space, including potential retail and restaurant uses as well as a community health center. The second new structure will rise to the north of the Ringer Building, holding 24 for-sale condominium units. The winning design will need to go through refinements via an additional community engagement process before going through the official review and approval process of the city. Approvals will potentially be required from the Community Development Commission, Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and the full Chicago City Council. A hearing in front of the Committee on Design is also expected. Construction is reportedly expected to begin by Fall 2022. ",South Shore
Two teams respond to city's request to redevelop South Shore site,"The City of Chicago is evaluating redevelopment proposals from a pair of teams hoping to revitalize a 1.7-acre site at 79th Street and Exchange Avenue in the South Shore community. The transit-oriented development would span two parcels containing vintage low-rise buildings and vacant land near the Cheltenham stop on Metra's Electric Main Line. Two teams responded to the city's Request for Proposals (RFP), which is part of the  INVEST South/West initiative to bring new vibrancy to revitalize key commercial corridors in historically underserved neighborhoods. The city recently selected winning proposals for vacant city-owned parcels in communities including Bronzeville, North Lawndale, South Chicago, and New City/Back of Yards. Here's a look at the two visions for the 79th and Exchange location.  Development team: AIE Development Group, Urban Array Impact Dev., Brennan Investment, Group Keely Construction
Design team: Ware Macomb, BTR Engineering
Cost: TBD The Array Innovation Exchange team proposes a mixed-use, mixed-income complex containing 40 to 50 residential units, three to five retail storefronts, and the new home of the Museum of Black Technology and Engineering. The existing Ringer Building would retain its historic facade within the modern exterior of the complex on the south side of 79th Street. The development would feature rooftop greenhouses for vertical farming serving several restaurants. Other proposed uses include a coffee shop and roaster, a digital media studio, and/or a start-up incubator space. On-site parking would be provided for 36 vehicles. Development team: DL3 Realty Advisors, Revere Properties, Claretian
Design team: KOO LLC, dbHMS, Site, Pioneer, McRostie
Cost: $65 million The Thrive Exchange team envisions a mixed-use, mixed-income project anchored by 86 rental apartments and 24 for-sale condominiums on both the north and south side of 79th Street. The proposal's commercial spaces include 11,000 square feet for retail and restaurant uses. The Ringer Building would be preserved and repurposed as medical offices plus collaborative space for local businesses. The plan would provide parking for 140 vehicles. ",South Shore
Ten-unit condo development headed to South Shore,"Chicago's South Shore community is about to get its first new condominium development in years. A four-story, ten-unit masonry building will soon break ground at a long-vacant lot located at the end of a cul-de-sac at 3012 E. 78th Street—across from Rainbow Beach Park. On Thursday, the Chicago Plan Commission approved a Lakefront Protection Ordinance application for the South Side site. The vote is a crucial step in the approval process for the estimated $7 million undertaking.  The project at 3012 E. 78th Street comes from developer Elam Industries LLC. The company is led by local South Shore resident Anita Richardson, who intends to occupy one of the building's ten for-sale units when the structure is complete.  Each residence features an open floorplan, elevator service, 11-foot ceilings, and views of the park and Lake Michigan. The development will use two existing parking spaces as well as provide parking for eight more cars in attached rear garages. ID Architecture serves as project designer. The condos will sell for between $649,000 to $799,000, according to Crain's Chicago Business, and two units are currently listed for sale by Real Properties Realty Group. Elam Industries plans to hold a groundbreaking ceremony later this month, begin construction in August, and welcome residents in spring 2022. The upcoming condo project wasn't the only South Shore development approved by the Chicago Plan Commission. The commissioners also gave preliminary zoning to a $60 million film production studio slated for a 7-acre site at 1525 E. 77th Street.  ",South Shore
South Shore film studios move forward,"An ambitious proposal to build a massive film production facility around the corner from the historic Avalon Regal Theater is moving forward in Chicago's South Shore community. Dubbed the Regal Mile Studios, the project was granted preliminary zoning approval by the Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday, July 15. The South Side development replaces a sprawling site between the Chicago Skyway and Stoney Island Avenue. Plans call for transforming the mostly vacant 7-acre parcel into five sound stages, flex space, ""green room"" facilities, supporting offices, and off-street parking for 95 vehicles. The Regal Mile Studios are a joint venture between Chicago developer Loop Capital Markets and Derek Dudley, a producer of Showtime's The Chi series who grew up in the South Shore neighborhood. Chicago-based Bauer Latoza Studio serves as design architect, according to the project's zoning application. The development team held several meetings with members of the public as well as city officials to refine their proposal. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development (DPD) had input on the contemporary design of the facade and requested the addition of trees and landscaping throughout the site. A public plaza was also added to the plan based on feedback from the community, according to materials posted by DPD.  The estimated $60 million project could be a major economic driver for the immediate area. It would create 250 construction jobs plus 34 permanent positions and roughly 300 production-related jobs during filming. The studio could also give a much-needed boost to struggling local businesses—and perhaps even kick-start the restoration of the landmark Avalon Regal Theater, which has sat vacant for more than a decade.  ""[South Shore is] in dire need of meaningful investment that will uplift the community,"" Derek Dudley told Crain's Chicago Business earlier this year. ""It's been forgotten. It's not the South Shore community I grew up in."" The Regal Mile Studios project isn't the only indication that Chicago's film industry is moving from strength to strength. Established production company Cinespace Studios is currently planning a big expansion of its North Lawndale campus. Meanwhile, a different group of developers is eyeing studio space in a former Marshall Field warehouse building located northwest of Logan Square.  On Tuesday, the Chicago Community Development Commission voted to approve the sale of six parcels of city-owned land at 1433-43 E. 77th Street and 7700-08 S. Blackstone Avenue for $31,000 to the development team.     ",South Shore
Quantum computing is headed to U.S. Steel South Works site,"Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Related Midwest, PsiQuantum, CRG, Clayco and other development partners recently announced the Illinois Quantum & Microelectronics Park (IQMP), a new quantum innovation campus that marks the first phase of a broader 400-acre master plan at 8080 S. DuSable Lake Shore Drive, in the South Chicago neighborhood. Related and CRG will co-develop the IQMP for anchor tenant PsiQuantum, a leader in quantum computing technology. 8080 S. DuSable Lake Shore Drive is located on the former U.S. Steel South Works site along the Lake Michigan shoreline, one of the largest contiguous infill waterfront properties in the country. The IQMP will occupy 128 acres on the southern end of the site. In addition to PsiQuantum, the campus will include cryo facilities and equipment labs, as well as research and office spaces for private companies and universities to collaborate. As a fully integrated, highly diversified industry leader, Related and its partners will leverage years of expertise in executing large-scale, multi-phase developments in Chicago and throughout the U.S. “The same ambition and innovation we’ve applied to some of Chicago’s largest and most complex real estate developments will be employed here as we deliver a next-generation quantum campus that will elevate Chicago and Illinois on the global stage,” said Curt Bailey, President of Related Midwest. “8080 S. DuSable Lake Shore Drive will catalyze investment in the South Chicago neighborhood, and we’re proud to be working with Governor Pritzker, Mayor Johnson, PsiQuantum and other stakeholders to lay the foundation for emerging industries that will propel the region’s economy into the future.” The first phase of the IQMP, designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, will occupy approximately 30 acres and is scheduled for completion in 2027. Clayco will serve as general contractor for the initial phase. Palo Alto, California-based PsiQuantum is a quantum computing company on a mission to build the world's first commercially useful quantum computer, which would be able to tackle some of the greatest challenges we face – across climate, energy, pharmaceutical, defense, financial services and beyond. “Building a utility-scale quantum computer at the IQMP is a generational project at an iconic location,” said Fariba Danesh, Chief Operating Officer, PsiQuantum. “We are thrilled to partner with Related and CRG to make this vision a reality on the aggressive timeline required to develop this critical technology. Innovative public-private partnerships like these are what earns Chicagoland its reputation as a global leader.” Located 10 miles from the Loop, 8080 S.

Red Line Extension receives $100 million grant,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has announced that the Red Line Extension Project, which will build a 5.6-mile extension of the Red Line to 130th Street, will receive another $100 million of federal funding, moving the project closer to the CTA’s goal of breaking ground in 2025. The project will receive a $100 million grant from the federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ)/Carbon Reduction Program, after receiving $30 million from the same source in 2021. The announcement follows the recent notification from the Federal Transit Administration in September 2023 that the RLE project was in line to receive $1.973 billion of federal “New Starts” funding. “CTA is successfully putting together the critical funding we need to build the transformational Red Line Extension, which will increase access to transit for Far South Side residents and serve as an economic catalyst for the region,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The Red Line Extension will improve residents’ quality of life by increasing access to jobs, education and more. I thank our federal partners for the continuing support of this life-changing project.” Originally promised by then Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1969, the Red Line Extension will look to extend the CTA Red Line past 95th St all the way down to the city’s southern border near 130th St. With work underway on the design, the $3.6 billion project will add another 5.6 miles of heavy rail and connect the Far South Side communities with 4 new stations. The Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  The remaining project funding will come from a $950 million Transit TIF approved by Chicago City Council in 2022 and other sources. The CTA is looking to award construction contracts in late 2024 and begin construction in 2025. The new Red Line Extension is targeted for a 2029 completion. ",South Side
CTA lands almost $2 billion in funding for Red Line Extension,"In a major milestone for the long-awaited transit project, the Federal Transit Administration has announced that the Red Line Extension (RLE) project is in line for $1.973 billion in critical grant funding needed to build the project. The grant would be the largest transit infrastructure grant awarded to CTA in the agency’s history. ""Reversing decades of disinvestment starts with providing accessible transportation for all residents of this city,"" said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “Today’s announcement serves as an important milestone for this project as we move to enhance capillary connections to create a more connected and accessible Chicago. We will continue to work with stakeholders, the state, and federal government to ensure this project is moving full steam ahead.” The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) notified CTA that the $3.6 billion RLE Project has advanced into the next phase of the federal “New Starts” program – an important step to moving the project closer to groundbreaking. CTA can now begin the “Engineering” phase of the project, which includes further design and engineering needed to build the project and identifies the federal grant dollars CTA can receive for the project once the engineering phase is completed and approved by FTA.  The infrastructure project will add another 5.6 miles of heavy rail both elevated and on grade with 4 new stations. The Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  “Today is a great day for the South Side of Chicago,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The Far South Side has been promised for 50 years that the Red Line would be extended to the city’s southern border, and today we can say that promise is significantly closer to being met. This project brings a wealth of job and training opportunities, and it enhances the quality of life for residents who will be able to access jobs and education more easily than ever before.” The Engineering phase of the project is expected to continue into 2024 and anticipates a funding award by the end of 2024 subject to federal review and approvals. The remaining project funding will come from a $950 million Transit TIF approved by Chicago City Council last year and other sources. ",South Side
CTA adds electric bus service to South Side,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) recently announced the roll-out of its newest fully accessible, all-electric buses to the #63 63rd route beginning this week after equipping its third bus facility to support all-electric buses. Today’s announcement marks the latest milestone in CTA’s efforts to convert to an electrified bus fleet by 2040 as part of CTA’s “Charging Forward Plan”. ""Improving bus services and connections for our most transit dependent riders has been and remains a priority for me and our expansion of all-electric buses to serve Chicago’s Far South Side is part of this commitment,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “Ensuring equity, the environment and the communities we serve are at the heart of our ‘Charging Forward’ Plan and we look forward to expanding the benefits of all-electric buses, especially to those communities that are disproportionately affected by air pollution, which are often those with low-income and minority populations.” The #63 route, which serves riders from Woodlawn to Chrysler Village, is now the second bus route to feature all-electric buses and is the first electric bus route out of the CTA’s 74th Street Garage, which is located in Chicago’s South Side. The CTA has prioritized equipping garages that serve neighborhoods with the highest air pollution levels, to best serve the communities in areas with disproportionately higher health vulnerability risks. In preparation for rolling out service along the #63 route, all bus operators based out of the 74th Street Garage received training on the specific features and systems of the new electric buses and how to operate them. The #63 route, which operates between 63rd/Stony Island and Midway, is one of CTA’s more heavily traveled bus routes, providing more than 2.4 million rides in 2022. CTA currently has 25 electric buses in its fleet and three of its seven existing bus garages are now equipped with charging facilities for electric buses, with plans to purchase additional vehicles and expand to additional routes and garages in the coming years. Since unveiling the “Charging Forward Plan” last year, CTA has received $29 million in grant funds from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to be used towards the purchase of fully accessible, all-electric buses, as well as bus facility communication and safety improvements to accommodate the new vehicles. Building upon a decade of leading an industry shift toward bus electrification, the CTA unveiled “Charging Forward: CTA Bus Electrification Planning Report” in February 2022 as a blueprint for the agency’s route to a full electric bus fleet and bus operational infrastructure over the next 18 years. Converting a bus fleet of more than 1,800 vehicles is a complex undertaking and will require new buses as well as charging station infrastructure and significant electrical power upgrades. The first of the CTA’s Proterra 600-Series, began running on the #66 Chicago route. Roll-out of these buses along the #66 route was the first step in a larger plan to electrify all bus service along Chicago Avenue. To accommodate the electric buses, the CTA added en-route chargers at Navy Pier, with plans to add more chargers as electric buses are added to additional routes. ",South Side
CTA announces finalists for Red Line Extension construction bids,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) continues to advance the transformational Red Line Extension (RLE) project with the announcement that it has selected three pre-qualified teams to submit proposals on the transformative project to extend rail service to Chicago’s Far South Side. Originally promised by then Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1969, the Red Line Extension will look to extend the CTA Red Line past 95th St all the way down to the city’s southern border near 130th St., With work underway on the design, the $3.6 billion project will add another 5.6 miles of heavy rail and connect the Far South Side communities with 4 new stations. The Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  “Today we move closer to providing Chicago residents with an extended and improved commute on the Red Line, our busiest line, by selecting the best and most qualified firms to ultimately build this dream and make it a reality,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “This historic project represents equity for the underserved South Side community by finally giving them a rail line that extends to the city limits.” In October of 2022, CTA issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) asking firms to submit their qualifications. After considering a pool of potential candidates, CTA selected the most qualified teams that have demonstrated the ability to design and build the rail extension. The three entities selected are: FH Paschen, Ragnar Benson, Milhouse and BOWA Joint Venture; Kiewit Infrastructure; and Walsh VINCI Transit Community Partners. These entities are representative of a variety of local, national and international businesses. This selected pool of candidates will move into the next phase of the competitive procurement process and CTA will decide which contracting team will ultimately be chosen to design and build the RLE project based on their submitted proposals. Project proposals will be due early 2024 with an expected execution by the end of 2024. The contracting teams’ proposals will be considered on a variety of criteria, including experience, price, diversity outreach plans, and other factors. CTA expects major construction of this project to begin in late 2025 and is dependent on securing full project funding. ",South Side
City Council approves Galleria 89,"The Chicago City Council has approved a mixed-use development dubbed Galleria 89. Located at the corner of E. 89th St and S. Commercial Ave, the project at 8854 S. Commercial was the chosen winner of the South Chicago Invest South/West RFP. The proposal is being developed by 548 Capital and Syzygy Cities. Designed by Rivetna Architects and Farr Associates, the development will see the construction of a new five-story, mixed-use building. Set to rise 76 feet tall, the building will have 46 affordable apartments with two commercial retail spaces along S. Commercial Ave. 12 parking spaces will be located along the alley. Residents will enter the building from the shared courtyard between the new construction and the adjacent existing building to the north that is also part of the development.  The massing of the building holds the corner of the site at the intersection while stepping back from the courtyard into a U-shape to minimize the shading of the courtyard. The facade is made up of a three-story masonry base topped by aluminum paneling on the upper two floors. The deep facade creates architectural interest while shading the windows.  With the structure set to meet Passive House standards, the building will use 60% less energy than permitted by code, have 40% lower utility bills, use heat pump technology, have quieter units, will be all electric, use induction cooking, and have a low embodied carbon. The building will have healthier interiors and include a rooftop solar array to help power the building. At 8840 S. Commercial, the development will renovate an existing, three-story, mixed-use building to contain 12 residential units and two ground-floor commercial units. The two retail spaces will face S. Commercial Ave while the residential entry will face the courtyard just like the new construction building. On the ground floor, two loft style apartments will face the back of the site and feature 13-foot ceilings. The upper two floors will have five apartments per floor with 4 out of 5 having balconies.  With a classic Chicago facade, the renovation will restore and maintain the current edifice. New storefront glazing will be added with steel details that celebrate the steel town history of the area. Glass garage doors will be added into the brick wall facing the courtyard for the future retail tenants to have access to the outdoor space. As mentioned, the development leaves a space in between the existing building and new construction to create a courtyard. This area gives access to the residential lobbies while giving a space for the community to gather.  With the Chicago City Council approving the project, the site will be rezoned from B3-2 to B3-3 with an overall Planned Development designation. The project is set to be funded by LIHTC equity and all of the units will be affordable at or below 60% AMI. With zoning entitlements in hand, the developers can move forward with securing funding and permits before beginning construction. A timeline for completion has not been announced. ",South Side

Transit TIF approved for Red Line Extension,"The Community Development Commission has approved plans for a Transit TIF to support the funding of the Red Line Extension. Originally promised by then Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1969, the Red Line Extension will look to extend the CTA Red Line past 95th St all the way down to the city’s southern border near 130th St.  With work underway on the design, the $3.6 billion project will add another 5.6 miles of heavy rail and connect the Far South Side communities with 4 new stations. The tracks will be elevated from the 95th St station down through 119th where it will transition to grade-level tracks running down to its new terminus at 130th St. With four new stations, the Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens.   Transit stations will be connected to the surrounding communities with bus connections, bike and pedestrian linkages, and with Park and Ride facilities. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  With equity at its core, The Red Line Extension will help those in the Far South communities gain access to new resources both inside and outside of their neighborhoods. For those traveling to the Loop from the area around 130th St, taking the Red Line extension will cut off 30 minutes from their commute. While stimulating new economic development for these areas, the plan will also align with the city’s climate initiatives, creating a new option for residents that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and helps with the climate change mitigation effort. The CTA has been working with DPD on an eTOD study to look into how economic development will be spurred in these areas with the new stations. An implementation roadmap is targeted for a presentation in front of the Chicago Plan Commission either late this year or early 2023. With more progress made in the last few years than over the last decade, the project’s recent history began with a non-binding referendum back in 2004 which showed local support for the project. In 2006, the CTA analyzed alternative alignments and formally selected the Union Pacific route as the locally preferred alternative in 2009. The draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was published in 2016, with the preferred track alignment selected in 2018. Late 2020 saw the entering into the project development phase as part of the Federal New Starts funding program and the CTA is wrapping up that portion of the timeline.  Now in 2022, the final Environmental Impact Statement was published, and the project team has reached 30% design completion. The CTA will launch an RFQ for major design-build contractors later this month and kick off a more than year-long engineering phase for the project. During this time, they will actively work on securing the final federal funding to achieve a full financing package. With this engineering and financing phase targeted to wrap up in mid-2024, the CTA will look to award construction contracts in late 2024 and begin construction in 2025. The new Red Line Extension is targeted for a 2029 completion.  As part of the $3.6 billion price tag, the CTA needs to contribute a “local match” to secure the federal funding through the Federal New Starts funding program. The Red Line Extension’s Transit TIF will raise $950 million in increment to provide that necessary local funding. Similar to a traditional TIF district, the Transit TIF allows for the increment raised to more directly benefit transit projects. With a boundary from Madison St to the north and 134th St to the south, the Transit Facility Improvement Area, or TFIA, includes all parcels within a half mile of the Red Line within the north/south extents just mentioned. Within that boundary, the Transit TIF will be a more specific area bound by Madison St to the north and Pershing Rd to the south. This district will make up the parcels whose tax increment will be earmarked for the Red Line Extension. Parcels already in TIF districts will be excluded from the Transit TIF. This distribution means that parcels south of Pershing Rd that are within the TFIA will not be contributing their potential tax increment to funding the project. Representatives from the CTA explained that this decision was made because, while properties north of Pershing Road will generate $950 million over the lifetime of the TIF, properties south of Pershing Rd would only contribute $43 million. The decision was made to not include those areas so that their increment could be used for traditional TIF districts if so desired in the future.  With the Community Development Commission’s approval of the Transit TIF, its next step will be to go before the Chicago Plan Commission this month for a land use review. The CTA plans to garner final approvals from the Finance Committee and full City Council in December 2022. ",South Side
City Council approves residential conversion at 500 N. Michigan,"The Chicago City Council has approved a residential conversion of the existing office building at 500 N. Michigan. Planned by Connecticut-based developer Commonwealth Development Partners, the 304-foot-tall, 24-story building along the Mag Mile was originally built in 1968 and houses a series of retail tenants with most of its office space vacant. Designed by GREC Architects, the building would be converted into 320 residential dwelling units on floors 6-23. With a mix of studios, one-beds, and two-beds, the project will include 64 affordable apartments. Retail would remain on the first two floors with office space retained on the third through fifth floors. Residents would have access to amenity space on the seventh floor as well as a new rooftop amenity space on the 24th floor. This top floor amenity space would be both indoor and outdoor but would require additional FAR to be obtained through the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund bonus framework while also increasing the building height from 304 feet to 322 feet.  The building has a parking garage on the basement with valet service that can accommodate 68 cars. Access is from Lower Illinois St and would be continued as valet service after the conversion. With City Council approval secured, the existing Planned Development will be amended to allow for the project. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Streeterville
Preliminary landmark designation approved for Erie Street Row,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for the Erie Street Row, a set of three rowhouses at 161 E. Erie Street. Built around 1877 as residences for Chicagoans who achieved success in professional and commercial endeavors, the buildings are faced with Joliet limestone, one of the earliest building stones used in Chicago after the Great Fire when fireproof construction was in need.  Meeting Criterion 1 for their heritage, the Erie Street Row was built around 1877 when the Near North Side was being rebuilt as a desirable residential neighborhood after it was devastated by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. From the 1870s to the 1910s, the families of successful merchants and professionals lived in the Erie Street Row, reflecting the social fabric of the Near North Side.  The development of North Michigan Avenue as a commercial boulevard in the 1920s transformed the Near North Side from a residential to commercial district. During this time the Erie Street Row was converted to offices for small creative businesses like advertising, publishing, architecture and commercial and fine arts. Also meeting Criterion 3 for its association with a significant person, the Erie Street Row is significant for its association with Johnson O’Connor and Eleanor Manning O’Connor, husband and wife, who in 1952 opened the Chicago branch of the Human Engineering Laboratory of the Johnson O’Connor Research Foundation, a nonprofit educational and scientific organization.  Trained as an engineer, Johnson O’Connor developed a testing program for the General Electric Company in 1922 that proved successful in placing employees in the positions that matched their inherent aptitudes. In 1938, OConnor expanded his testing program to the general public, opening branches across the country to help young people and adults make informed decision about their education and career. Eleanor Manning O’Connor was a pioneering woman architect who specialized in historic preservation, public housing and urban planning. Beginning in the 1930s, Eleanor Manning O’Connor influenced Johnson O’Connor to publish his research on women’s aptitude that encouraged women to pursue careers in architecture, engineering and the sciences. The Erie Street Row also meets Criterion 4 for exemplary architecture, as it is a visually distinctive group of row houses, a building type of importance to Chicago architectural history. Built around 1877, this set of row houses is a particularly early, surviving group. The row is distinctive for its fine use of the Italianate architectural style, a style of importance to Chicago architecture in the 1850s through early 1880s.  The Erie Street Row exhibits fine detailing and craftsmanship in Joliet limestone, a historically significant building material in the context of Chicago architecture and the most popular building stone used for Chicago buildings from the 1830s until the 1880s.  The Erie Street Row is also found to meet the Integrity Criterion as it retains good integrity from both its original construction in 1877 and alterations in 1920 that have significance in their own right. Granted, two of the westernmost rowhouses in the group were demolished in 1960, the three that remain continue to convey the building’s architectural and heritage values.  The Joliet limestone façade is intact and appears to be in good condition after nearly 150 Chicago winters. Two keystones have been replaced and the stone has been painted, but the overall Italianate design intent is clearly expressed. The building’s pressed metal cornice has areas of corrosion but is remarkably intact. Most of the original wood sash windows remain, though these exhibit deterioration typical for their age.  Exterior alterations were made to the building in 1920 when it converted from residential to commercial functions. The three, elevated separate entrances to the individual rowhouses were consolidated into a single entrance at grade. The elevated stairways were removed, and the entrance door openings were converted into windows. Two steel-frame window bays were added at this time as storefront window displays for retail tenants at the raised basement level. These alterations have achieved significance as they reflect the building's transition to new uses for creative businesses in the 20th century. The preliminary designation recognizes all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building to be deemed as significant features to be protected. The three-story common brick boiler house addition and one-story common brick garage at the rear elevation of the building are devoid of architectural treatment and the Commission may approve demolition of these additions to support new uses of the building.  With the preliminary recommendation approved, Landmarks staff will draft a final designation report before the Commission on Chicago Landmarks approves a final landmark recommendation. Once that approval is secured, the proposed designation will head to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.  ",Streeterville

Related Midwest celebrates groundbreaking of 400 Lake Shore Drive,"Related Midwest yesterday celebrated the groundbreaking of phase one of 400 Lake Shore in downtown Chicago. The two-tower residential development will bring luxury and affordable living options to the prominent waterfront site within the Streeterville neighborhood, the last undeveloped parcel where Lake Michigan meets the Chicago River. “Chicago is a city defined by innovation and tenacity, that continuously rises to meet challenges and exceed expectations,” said Curt Bailey, President of Related Midwest. “400 Lake Shore is the latest embodiment of this spirit and will set a new standard for vibrant, and equitable, urban living. I deeply appreciate everyone who has played a role in getting us to this pivotal moment.” Designed by Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill, the first phase of 400 Lake Shore includes a 72-story, 858-foot tower on the northern end of the site that will comprise 635 rental apartments in a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom layouts. Meeting ARO requirements, 20% of the apartments, or 127 units, will be affordable housing. Building interiors were designed by MAWD, with Stantec serving as the architect of record.  In conjunction with its development of the first tower, Related will also deliver the highly anticipated DuSable Park, named in honor of Chicago’s first non-native settler, Jean-Baptiste Pointe DuSable. In addition to making a $10 million commitment, Related will lead construction of the 3.3-acre park, located east of Lake Shore Drive and accessible via Founder’s Way—a planned extension of the Chicago Riverwalk that will also be completed as part of phase one. Including the park, 400 Lake Shore will offer 4.5 acres of publicly available space, including a plaza between the towers with amenities, a two-story podium and public art. Construction financing for the tower and public improvements, including the completion of the Chicago Riverwalk to DuSable Park, was a collaboration between the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA), Wells Fargo, Bank of America N.A., PNC and other leading financial institutions. During the groundbreaking ceremony for 400 Lake Shore, guests signed a link beam that will be lowered into the site’s infamous cofferdam—a relic of the Spire that is being incorporated into the new design—to become a permanent part of the new structure and connect one side of the foundation to the other.

Related Midwest completes marathon foundation pour for 400 Lake Shore Drive,"This week Related Midwest in collaboration with LR Contracting Company and BOWA Construction completed a mat foundation pour for the first of two towers at 400 Lake Shore Drive.  To form the foundation of the 72-story tower, a caravan of over 250 concrete trucks delivering every 2 minutes over a 12-hour period delivered 9 million pounds of concrete. Over 2,300 cubic yards, or 470,000 gallons, of concrete was placed on-site. The volume is equivalent to filling an Olympic size swimming pool or a 9-mile-long sidewalk.  Approximately 622,000 pounds of reinforcing steel, equivalent to about 155 automobiles, was placed on-site over the past two weeks in preparation for the foundation pour. The massive effort was managed by 30 workers on-site, plus 25 concrete truck drivers. Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill with Stantec serving as the architect of record, the towers feature thoughtful nods to Chicago architectural history and geography.

Heading up to the second and third floors, we walked through the parking garage which will accommodate 106 cars. The space is currently raw and construction netting is enclosing the floors. Working our way up the building, we stopped in the office space on the fourth and fifth floors. Spanning 45,000 square feet, the unique office opportunity presents office tenants with a flagship opportunity in Streeterville. The office space will have a separate bank of elevators from the residential units above. Due to the height of the building, structural cores are not needed around the elevators, and they are currently open to the rest of the floor plate with temporary metal plates infilling the holes in each floor plate. Structural loads are accommodated with the stair cores and reinforced columns.   Moving on to the residential floors, level 6 will be the first residential level. Mechanicals are currently intertwined with pole shores that are in place until the concrete fully cures. The volume of the building sets back at the 6th floor creating space for small private terraces. The apartments on upper floors will have protruding balconies.  Heading up to the top deck, we walked the 9th floor deck which was being prepared for a concrete pour the next day. Crews were laying MEP to be cast in place as well as structural rebar and post-tensioning cables. Goebel Construction is leading the concrete work. Wrapping up on the ground floor, the office lobby will come off of N. St. Clair St and head to the elevator lobby inside the floor plate. 7,500 square feet of retail space will fill out the street frontage on the corner and along E. Grand Ave, with the residential entry at the east end of the street frontage. Crews were finishing up utilities tie-ins near the corner of the building and masonry crews were beginning to enclose the bike room at the back of the building along the alley.  Lendlease began construction in December 2022 with work going vertical this past February. The concrete structure is set to top out in August, with windows beginning in June and wrapping up in October. The first occupancy is set for Spring 2024. ",Streeterville

In what will be a first for the developer in the Chicago area, Optima Verdana plants will stay green year-round and be maintained by Optima’s property management team. The self-containing irrigation and drainage system promotes evaporative cooling, re-oxygenates the air, reduces dust and smog levels, decreases ambient noise and detains stormwater. From start to finish, Optima Verdana will embody a 360-degree approach to sustainability. The building is being constructed to achieve two Green Globes through the Green Globes® building certification, an alternative to LEED certification.

Chicago Bears close on Arlington Heights property,"The Chicago Bears have announced that they have closed on the Arlington Heights property that is potentially set to become home to a new stadium and mixed-use destination. After signing an agreement for the purchase of the 326-acre site back in September 2021 and revealing their preliminary master plan back in September 2022, this milestone represents the next step in the process towards building a new stadium.   Paying a cool $197 million, the Bears assured that “finalizing the purchase does not guarantee the land will be developed.” According to team officials, there is “still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible.” Set to become one of the largest megaprojects of the Midwest, the master plan by Hart Howerton includes a multi-purpose entertainment district anchored by a new, best-in-class stadium that would be enclosed. The aspiration would be to have a caliber of facility that could host events such as the Super Bowl, College Football Playoffs and Final Four. ‏The stadium’s entertainment district would be complemented by the creation of a further mixed-use district, offering multi-purpose entertainment venues, commercial/retail spaces, and housing that could provide economic benefit to Cook County and the surrounding areas of Illinois. ‏The team envisions the expansive district to potentially include restaurants, office space, hotels, fitness space, new parks and open spaces, and other public realm improvements.  Team officials claim that “possible construction of a stadium-anchored development is projected by analysts to create more than 48,000 jobs, generate $9.4 billion in economic impact for the Chicagoland economy and provide $3.9 billion in new labor income to workers across the region.” The completed development could create almost 10,000 new permanent jobs and generate $1.4 billion in economic impact for Chicagoland. With all that said, team officials reiterated that they will need financial assistance ""to ensure feasibility, including our securing property tax certainty and support for infrastructure commensurate with the public benefits the project will yield to the region. For the development to move forward, and for this effort to be financially feasible, a public-private partnership addressing predictable taxes and necessary infrastructure funding for public uses is essential.” The official announcement from the team closed by claiming that there has been “no decision that the development of the recently acquired property will occur.” Pending battles with different governmental bodies for the financial assistance they seek and the unknown timeline for the actual project design, a timeline for when the scheme could come to fruition is as clear as mud.

According to the statement released by the team, they remain under contract to purchase the site, but there are still conditions that need to be met before they would be able to close on the property. If they do close, it is not a guarantee that the team will develop it.  While the project is not officially moving forward, the project would be one of the largest development projects in Illinois state history, according to the release. With Hart Howerton on board for the master plan, the vision includes a multi-purpose entertainment district anchored by a new, best-in-class stadium that would be enclosed. The aspiration would be to have a caliber of facility that could host events such as the Super Bowl, College Football Playoffs and Final Four. ‏The master plan goes on to create a further mixed-use district, offering multi-purpose entertainment venues, commercial/retail spaces, and housing that could provide economic benefit to Cook County and the surrounding areas of Illinois. ‏The team envisions the expansive district to potentially include restaurants, office space, hotels, fitness space, new parks and open spaces, and other public realm improvements.  The team estimated that construction of the plan would create more than 48,000 jobs with a resulting $1.4 billion annual economic impact. Tax revenues are projected at $16 million in annual tax revenue in addition to property taxes for Arlington Heights, $9.8 million for Cook County, and $51.3 million for the State of Illinois. According to the statement, the team would privately finance the stadium construction, but are looking towards the various governmental bodies for supplemental public funding as they build out the rest of the master plan.  ‏‏‎While they cannot discuss or explore any other alternative stadium sites or opportunities while they are under contract, the team reportedly is committed to Soldier Field and will honor the terms of its lease. This means they cannot respond to Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s recent proposals for a dome over Soldier Field or other improvements. There is much more work to be done before the Bears may say goodbye to Soldier Field in favor of a suburban, mixed-use district with a new, enclosed stadium. Once they close on the property, then they will decide whether to develop on it and what that timeline may look like.  The team is hosting a community meeting this Thursday, September 8th for an informational discussion about the potential purchase and redevelopment. The meeting will take place 7-9 pm at John Hersey High School's gymnasium (1900 E Thomas St, Arlington Heights). School parking lots are scheduled to open at 5 pm and doors open at 5:30 pm. Guests will not be allowed on campus prior to 5 pm. Attendees will be admitted first come, first served until capacity is reached. ",Suburbs

Chicago Bears ink deal to purchase Arlington Racecourse,"The prospect of the Chicago Bears leaving their longtime home at Soldier Field and building a new stadium in suburban Arlington Heights just became a little more real: The team signed a purchase and sale agreement for the 326-acre Arlington International Racecourse property. News of the deal—which still hasn't closed—was first reported by The Athletic and later confirmed by the Bears, Arlington Racecourse owner Churchill Downs, and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. It comes roughly two months after the Bears submitted a bid to purchase the sprawling northwest suburban site. ""We are excited to have executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) for the Arlington Park property,"" Bears president and CEO Ted Phillips said in a statement Wednesday. ""We are grateful to Churchill Downs Incorporated for their efforts to reach this point...  Finalizing the PSA was the critical next step in continuing our exploration of the property and its potential."" The team's dissatisfaction with Soldier Field and its Chicago Park District owners boils down to money. The stadium is geographically landlocked and one of the smallest capacity venues in the league. It doesn't offer the team revenue-generating perks such as a nearby entertainment district, on-site sports betting, or the option for a stadium naming rights deal. The team's lease with the city runs through 2033, but the Bears could theoretically break the agreement as early as 2026 and pay an $84 million penalty.  A spokesperson for the mayor's office said in a statement that City Hall was ""not surprised"" by the Arlington purchase agreement but will remain ""committed to continuing the work to keep the team in Chicago"" and are open to further discussions. ""My statement still stands on the Bears: my admin remains committed to continuing the work to keep the team in Chicago, "" Mayor Lightfoot tweeted late Tuesday evening. ""As I have said numerous times, our door in City Hall remains open.""  If the Bears go through with the move, it could also threaten the viability of the massive One Central real estate development proposed for the air rights above the rail tracks just west of Soldier Field. One Central developer Bob Dunn redeveloped land adjacent to stadiums for the Detroit Lions, Minnesota Vikings, and Green Bay Packers and is likely expecting the Bears to stay put. Conversely, if One Central is approved and built, the megaproject could potentially partner with the Bears and provide the year-round entertainment district and sportsbook the team appears to need so badly.  On September 25, Arlington Racecourse held what was likely to be its last horse races. The suburban location benefits from a Metra stop but is still some 25 miles northwest of the current stadium. The venue opened in the late 1920s, and its impressive main grandstand was designed by architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merril in the 1980s.

DPI pulls plug on new headquarters at The 78,"The Discovery Partners Institute has announced that they are pulling the plug on their planned new headquarters at The 78 megadevelopment. Set to be located at 1519 S. Wells, the project was set to anchor the south end of the 78 fronting the future intersection of W.15th St and S. Wells St. Since it was set to be funded by the state, the Illinois Capital Development Board has been overseeing the project. With OMA as the design architect and Jacobs as the architect of record, the project was supposed to take the form of an eight-story building that would have encompassed approximately 213,000 square feet of space. Rising 136 feet, the building was to house classrooms, meeting and event spaces, labs and offices for research, development and startups, as well as collaboration space interspersed throughout the building.  The announcement comes after years of work to get to a point where the beginning of construction was imminent. Local contractor Clark Construction had already begun fencing off and locating equipment on site to begin site work for the building.  DPI has announced they will split their new headquarters into a new building at the planned Illinois Quantum & Microelectronics Park on the US Steel South Works Site while also maintaining a downtown presence in their 200 S. Wacker location while exploring options for a new downtown location. As DPI leaves The 78 property, developer Related Midwest is already exploring new options with the concept of co-locating the new White Sox stadium and a dedicated soccer stadium for the Chicago Fire. Chicago Fire FC owner Joe Mansueto recently announced his intent to build a soccer-specific stadium and included that he intends to fund it with entirely private funds. With the DPI’s exit and the exploration of the new stadiums, the future development of The 78 is going back to the drawing board with no timeline for the construction of any buildings.  ",The 78
DPI HQ presents final design to Plan Commission,"The Chicago Plan Commission was presented the final design for the Discovery Partners Institute’s new headquarters at the 78 as the development looks to get final site plan approval. Located on a one-acre parcel, the project will anchor the south end of the 78, fronting the future intersection of W.15th St and S. Wells St, also known as the Wells-Wentworth Connector. The project, addressed as 1519 S. Wells, is being overseen by the Illinois Capital Development Board since the project is being funded by the state. With OMA as the design architect and Jacobs as the architect of record, the project will take the form of an eight-story building that will encompass approximately 213,000 square feet of space. Rising 136 feet, the building will house classrooms, meeting and event spaces, labs and offices for research, development and startups, as well as collaboration space interspersed throughout the building.  With programming driving the design, the building’s program was stacked into efficient volumes and then enclosed with a unified form. Derived from the multidirectionality of the site, the rounded forms seek to not privilege any direction, creating a democratic form that orients itself to all of its surroundings.  Each floor inside the building is split into three neighborhoods. The northern neighborhood will be the innovation neighborhood, home to computational labs and offices. At the south end, the experimental neighborhood will include experimental labs and workstations. The center of the building is home to the instructional neighborhood, which hosts classrooms as well as the building core to the east side.  The center of the building will be home to an atrium that is positioned as an active collision zone within a network of flexible collaboration zones interspersed throughout the building. Floating meeting rooms and connecting stairs will enliven the atrium with opportunities for users to interact and collaborate. The larger network of circulation and interaction zones includes perimeter-facing circulation that includes stairs with smaller flexible workspaces for those who want quieter spaces. The ground floor has been designed to be very open and public, with generous sidewalks and entry plazas for accessing the building. On the interior, a cafe will be open to the public, with multipurpose rooms available for programming and potential community meetings. A 100-person auditorium and the open floor plan will also allow for larger events, including potential career fairs.  For sustainability, the building will meet LEED Gold while also implementing bird protection, construction waste diversion, and workforce development. There will be no on-site parking for cars, but bike parking will be included with showers and changing rooms. With this courtesy presentation taken care, the development is making its way to a final site plan approval before construction can begin. As the first building set to begin construction in 2024, the rest of The 78 will follow at an undetermined timeline under the control of Related Midwest. ",The 78
Committee on Design reviews DPI HQ,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the proposed design for the Discovery Partners Institute’s new headquarters at the 78. Located on a one-acre parcel, the project will anchor the south end of the 78, fronting the future intersection of W.15th St and the Wells-Wentworth Connector. The project is being overseen by the Illinois Capital Development Board since the project is being funded by the state. With OMA as the design architect and Jacobs as the architect of record, the project will take the form of an eight-story building that will encompass approximately 213,000 square feet of space.

On the interior, a cafe will be open to the public, with multipurpose rooms available for programming and potential community meetings. A 100-person auditorium and the open floor plan will also allow for larger events, including potential career fairs.  The discussion opened with Juan Moreno, who asked the team what transpired between the announcement of them winning the project and now, considering the major design change. A representative from the Discovery Partners Institute stated that the process included the rightsizing of the building square footage considering the project’s budget. During their presentation, the architect from OMA showed how they began with a more stacked and stepped design for the program, which has been converted to the efficient vertical stacks in the current design.  Juan Moreno also commented that he appreciated the democratic space comment and the notion that it is a project for all. However, Moreno felt that, considering the building’s relationship to all the unique parts of the city around it, the uniform shape is potentially missing opportunities to tailor the design to its context. The architects responded that his comment is well taken, and they took the approach to be democratic, but a different approach could be to tailor the facades based on their orientation and directly address the surrounding context. Philip Enquist commended the team on a beautiful project and echoed Juan Moreno’s comment by saying that the surroundings are not the same in all directions, so each side is a different experience. Enquist added comments about the ground floor, mentioning that the cafe should face the Wells-Wentworth Connector and wondered why the auditorium and multipurpose rooms are closed instead of more open. Enquist’s last comment was a suggestion that the atrium collision zone should be more connected to the river by pulling it to the west facade, making it visible from the Wells-Wentworth Connector and the river.  The architects responded that some of these comments echo similar comments from DPD and they continue to study the ground floor in particular. Currently, the design is looking to orient activity towards the future W. 15th St where the sidewalk will connect people to the river. They also acknowledged that creating visibility between the street and the collision zone was a fair point.  Philip Enquist jumped back in with the final comment of the session, asking the team what their energy strategy was for the project. Since the team is dealing with budgetary constraints, the architects said they are looking at a fairly typical mechanical system while working to optimize performance through shading the building on the south and west facades, as well as working to meet LEED Gold.   With committee input, the project is moving forward with its final design. Groundbreaking is anticipated for 2024. ",The 78
Final design revealed for Discovery Partners HQ,"Announced by Governor JB Pritzker and the University of Illinois System’s Discovery Partners Institute, the final design for the Discovery Partners Institute headquarters has been revealed. Planned for a one-acre portion of The 78, the complex will be sited on the south end towards Chinatown. With architecture firms OMA and Jacobs collaborating on the design, the new building will provide more than 200,000 square feet of office, classroom, lab, and event space for DPI and its university and industry partners. The Illinois Capital Development Board oversees design and construction. The eight-story building has been designed to connect with its surroundings, exhibiting a multi-directional form that is impartial to any one specific direction. Engaged with the surrounding buildings, riverfront, and future phases of the Innovation District at The 78, the building’s base will hold a cafe, auditorium, and multi-purpose exhibition space. The building’s main entry will be located at 15th Street and Wells-Wentworth, with a Richard Hunt sculpture anchoring the site landscape. Upper floors will include classrooms, experimental labs, computational labs, and a terrace on the top floor. “DPI cultivates opportunities for research, learning, and innovation to diverse communities, requiring an architecture that adapts to continued growth of its programs. We wanted to provide a building that fosters interdisciplinary interaction and experimentation,” said Shohei Shigematsu, OMA Partner. “Programs are organized to maximize efficiency and potential to converge, and variegated layouts are configured around a central zone of collisions. A soft, transparent form and public ground floor offer an open invitation for the community to the building and its network.” As part of the University of Illinois system, The State of Illinois has provided $500 million in capital funding to launch DPI and establish its Innovation Network at regional universities throughout the state. Related Midwest, the developer of The 78, donated the land for DPI and will oversee the continued buildout of the 62-acre property. The project is expected to break ground in 2024, becoming the first building to begin construction in The 78 Innovation District. It will mark the beginning of a transformation that will connect the South Loop and Chinatown, filling a 62-acre void that has long separated them. ",The 78
Photos: Wells-Wentworth Connector making progress at The 78,"Just south of downtown, the Wells-Wentworth Connector is taking shape in new photos from the Chicago Department of Transportation.  ""The major segment of the new Wells Street roadway south of Roosevelt Road has been completed with final landscaping ongoing,"" CDOT spokesperson Michael Claffey told Urbanize. Crews from F.H. Paschen have also completed one of the two rail bridges associated with the project. The new bridge replaces one from 1930 and was completed six days ahead of schedule, according to Claffey. Construction on the second bridge will begin later this year.  The new north-south roadway features new lighting and a tree-lined double parkway designed to safely separate cyclists, pedestrians, and car traffic. The street uses raised speed tables (essentially flattened speed bumps) to discourage speeding. When the Wells-Wentworth Connector opens to traffic in 2022, it will not only provide a vital connection between the Loop and Chinatown, but serve as Main Street for what basically amounts to a whole new neighborhood: a 62-acre mixed-use megadevelopment dubbed The 78. Developed by Related Midwest and master-planned by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the estimated $7 billion project is zoned for up to 13 million square feet of residential and commercial buildings with towers reaches as high as 950 feet. The plan includes 12 acres of open space and a University of Illinois research and innovation center known as the Discovery Partners Institute. A public riverwalk at the 78 will eventually connect to riverfront paths at planned developments to the north, such as The Reed at Southbank. Construction of the Wells-Wentworth Connector is supported by $700 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) which the city approved for The 78 in 2019. The funds will also be used to complete other infrastructure at the site, including work to relocate Metra rail tracks and construct a new CTA Red Line subway station at Clark and 15th streets. The 78 is expected to take 10 to 20 years to fully build out. Related declined to comment on its schedule for breaking ground and completing other phases of the project, and the CTA did not respond to a request for comment regarding its timetable for the new Red Line Station. According to the City of Chicago's website for The 78, Related Midwest is ""studying potential modifications to their design and future plans in response to shifting market conditions prior to proceeding.""    ",The 78
City Council approves adaptive reuse of 208 S. LaSalle,"The Chicago City Council has approved a rezoning for The LaSalle Residences, an office-to-residential adaptive reuse project at 208 S. LaSalle. Planned by The Prime Group, the 21-story building was Burnham’s last design before he died, built in 1914 for the Continental and Commercial National Bank. The Prime Group has already converted the lower 12 floors into a JW Marriott Hotel and opened floors 18-22 as The LaSalle Hotel with 232 keys in 2022.  Completed in 1914, the historic 1.2 million-square-foot, 22-story building at 208 S. LaSalle St. was initially designed by world-famous Chicago architect D.H. Burnham & Co. in the Classical Revival style for the Continental and Commercial National Bank. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007. As part of the plan, roughly 222,500 square feet of office space on floors 13 to 16 will be repurposed into 226 apartments offered in studio, one- and two-bedroom floor plans. The LaSalle Residences will feature a new ground-floor lobby as well as residential amenities, including a state-of-the-art fitness facility; club-inspired tenant lounge spaces supporting coworking, meetings and social events; and penthouse-level community terraces with an outdoor pool and gathering areas overlooking the historic structure’s central atrium and offering panoramic views of the Loop’s iconic skyline. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative and Lucien Lagrange, the conversion will also upgrade all older mechanical systems with modern energy-efficient equipment and replace the existing single-pane windows with high-performance insulated glass. The mixed-income project will set aside 30% of the residences as affordable housing for qualifying individuals and families earning an average of 60% of the area mean income (AMI). The transit-oriented location is in the heart of Chicago’s central business district adjacent to the historic CTA Quincy station and within walking distance of other CTA stops, Metra commuter rail stations and Chicago Water Taxi service. With City Council approval secured, the property’s Planned Development designation will be removed, and the site will be reverted to its underlying zoning of DC-16 to allow for the residential conversion. The developer expects to begin construction on the $130 million redevelopment in early 2025.  ",The Loop
CDC approves $98 million in TIF for 135 S. LaSalle,"The Community Development Commission has approved $98 million in TIF funding for the residential conversion of The Field Building at 135 S. LaSalle. Originally proposed by Riverside Investment and Development and AmTrustRE, local developer DL3 Realty has been added to the development team.  135 S. LaSalle, known as the Field building, is a 44-story Art-Deco style building that was designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst, and White and was completed in 1934 and designated as a Chicago Landmark in 1994. The 1.35 million square foot building has large floor plates and has over 1.125 million square feet of vacancy (83%) mostly due to Bank of America’s headquarters relocating to 110 N. Wacker. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the new scope of the adaptive reuse will convert 624,000 square feet of space in the building into 386 residential units and 92,000 square feet of commercial space. On lower level one, the ground level, and level two, the project will feature 92,000 square feet dedicated to commercial space which is intended to include neighborhood amenities such as a small format grocer, health/fitness center, medical office, and complementary uses. Levels three and four will be converted into an approximate 100,000 square feet parking garage with 177 parking spaces. Located on Floors 5-14, the residential component of the project consists of 430,050 square feet. The floors will be converted into 386 residential units, of which 116 (30%) will be affordable to households with an average income of under 60% of the AMI. The unit mix is expected to include 228 studios, 106 one-beds, 52 two-beds, with the project listing a per-unit development cost of $500,140. The residential units will also have access to both indoor and outdoor amenity space on floors five, 25, 43, and 44.   The $241.5 million development will be funded by an $86 million private loan, $19.8 million in general partner equity, $98 million in TIF funding, $32.1 million in Historic Tax Credit Equity, and a $5.5 million deferred developer fee. With Community Development Commission approval, the proposed TIF funding will head to City Hall to get final approvals and sign off from the City Council.

Preliminary landmark approved for 111 W. Monroe,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for the Harris Trust & Savings Bank. Located at 111 W. Monroe, the building consists of a traditional Classical Revival skyscraper built in 1911 and an East Tower addition from 1960 designed in the modern idiom. The subject site measures approximately one acre, and the buildings are constructed to the sidewalks along the southwest corner of the intersection of Clark and Monroe streets.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city heritage, the Harris Trust & Savings Bank exemplifies the boom in banking in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century that led to Chicago being a prominent American financial center. The bank and its founder established the idea of buying and selling bonds as a primary business for the bank and sold it to the public. The Harris Trust & Savings Bank was a large employer and held major assets in Chicago for the majority of the 20th century. By the 1970s, the bank had amassed over $4 billion in assets and employed approximately 3,500 people in the Chicago area. In 1984, when it was purchased by the Bank of Montreal, Harris Trust & Savings Bank was the third-largest bank in Chicago.  Also meeting Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture, the 1911 portion of the Harris Trust & Savings Bank is an excellent example of Classical Revival architecture as applied to a skyscraper, influenced by the prominent 1893 World’s Fair and the city’s innovative approach to taller buildings. It features a tripartite design, monumental engaged pink granite columns, and applied terra cotta ornament.  Designed by SOM, the East Tower from 1960 is an excellent example of mid-century International Style architecture, influenced by the popularity of modernist architects in the United States. It features a steel structure, glass and metal curtain wall, and an absence of applied ornament. Though the Harris Bank Building and East Tower were not designed in the same style, they are visually integrated at the exterior with aligned floor levels and use of columns. They are also fully integrated in the interior.   Meeting Criterion 5 as the work of important architects, the 1911 building was designed by prominent firm Shepley, Rutan, & Coolidge who were also the architects for other notable works in Chicago including the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Cultural Center. The 1960 building was designed by Chicago-based firm Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill, an internationally important firm known for their skyscraper designs. The firm designed other significant buildings in Chicago including the Willis Tower and 875 N Michigan Avenue. Walter A. Netsch was supervising designer for the East Tower. Netsch was a noted individual designer who spent his career at SOM, working on projects like the Inland Steel Building and the U.S. Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel for the firm.  The Harris Trust & Savings Bank and the East Tower also meet the separate Integrity Criterion. They are in their original location on Monroe Street, and though the setting has been further developed in the second half of the twentieth century, they remain located in the commercial, financial, and civic center of the city. Overall, the Harris Trust & Savings Bank and the East Tower retain their original materials at the exterior. Like many early 20th century commercial buildings in the Loop, the cornice of the 1911 building has been removed. However, the Harris Trust & Savings Bank retains integrity of design and is still clearly recognizable as a Classical Revival building with its monumental Ionic columns. The East Tower is still clearly recognizable as an International Style building with minimal ornament, rectilinearity, and emphasis on volume. As proposed, the designation would declare the significant features to be protected as all exterior elevations of the 1911 Harris Trust & Savings Bank and the 1960 East Tower as well as the pair of bas relief bronze lion sculptures on the front façade of the 1911 Harris Trust & Savings Bank. As part of the LaSalle Reimagined initiative, this building will be redeveloped by Prime/Capri Interest, LLC, made up of The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group. The project has already received approval from the CDC for a $40 million TIF payment to convert the historic structure into a mixed-use building, set to include 345 apartments, 226 hotel keys, and meeting/event space on the second floor. The roof level will be reactivated by reopening the original Monroe Club as an amenity for residents and hotel guests. The former mechanical penthouse will become a restaurant, with the outdoor deck including a pool.  ",The Loop
Medline triples office space at Merchandise Mart,"Medline and Vornado Realty Trust have announced an agreement to expand Medline’s presence at THE MART by 110,000 square feet, making it one of the largest tenants at Vornado’s iconic, 3.7-million-square-foot property in downtown Chicago. Medline will more than triple its offices in THE MART from 51,000 to 161,000 square feet as part of a single, contiguous space across the majority of the 12th floor, committing to a long term lease with Vornado which will run through 2036. Headquartered in Northfield, Illinois, Medline is the healthcare industry’s largest medical-surgical product manufacturer, supply chain provider and clinical solutions partner.  Medline currently has over 39,000 employees worldwide and does business in more than 100 countries and territories.  Medline brings improved clinical, financial and operational outcomes across all points of care —from large healthcare systems and independent physician practices to home health patients and their families. “As Medline continues to grow, the company is committed to ensuring it has the space needed for employees to thrive, collaborate and feel connected to the culture that has sustained us through the years,” said Kate Slattery, Vice President of Real Estate and Construction for Medline. “Medline regularly optimizes our footprint and operations to best serve our customers and empower our team members. We are thrilled with the results from our current offices in THE MART and are pleased to be expanding this partnership further.” “Medline is one of the Chicago area’s largest and most pre-eminent companies, and we are thrilled to be able to support their continued growth,” said Glen Weiss, Executive Vice President, Co-Head of Real Estate at Vornado. “With its prime location and unrivaled amenity program, THE MART aligns perfectly with Medline’s needs and continues to be a major bright spot in the Chicago office market.” Vornado recently completed the final phase of a more than $70 million renovation program, which incorporates a grand staircase leading to a second-floor amenity program and gathering space that features a range of food and beverage options, a state-of-the-art fitness and conference center, an exclusive tenant lounge and an expansive landscaped River Park, serving as a “front lawn” to the building.

ZBA approves variation for 79 W. Monroe,"The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a variation for the residential conversion planned at 79 W. Monroe. Planned by R2 Companies and the Campari Group, the Rector Building is a 14-story Beaux Arts-style masonry office building constructed in 1905 with a large, seamless south addition completed in 1924. The building occupies the full site at the southeast corner of W. Monroe St and S. Clark St.  Designed by Ware Malcomb, the adaptive reuse and conversion will measure approximately 100,000 square feet within the building, including the basement and floors 7 through 14. The conversion will transform floors 7 to 13 into 117 residential units, 41 of which (35%) will be designated as affordable housing. The project’s unit mix will include 56 studios, 54 one-beds, 7 two-beds. Zero parking spaces will be included in the project. On the ground floor, the renovated lobby along W. Monroe St will feature a dedicated entrance for residents only, enhancing security and accessibility. Amenities provided for residents will include a tenant lounge, fitness center, outdoor areas, bike storage, and a dog run, all located in the basement and on floor 14. Floors 2 through 6 will undergo no changes; they will continue to house the Intrinsic School, a charter high school.    Preservation efforts will focus on retaining and repairing the building’s character-defining exterior masonry, including brick, stone, and terra-cotta elements. The non-historic windows on the second through seventh floors will be retained, while the historic wood windows on floors 8 through 13 will be repaired. Metal fire windows on secondary elevations will be replaced with new aluminum windows designed to match the existing profiles. Internally, the existing elevator lobbies and corridors on floors 7 through 13 will be preserved, with nearby office spaces reconfigured into apartment units.  The Zoning Board of Appeals approved a variation to eliminate the one required loading berth for the development. Due to the footprint of the building occupying the entire site, the physical configuration of the property makes it infeasible to add a loading space. Future residents would use the alley for loading. With the variation approved, the developer can continue to move forward with the project and get closer to starting construction. A joint venture of Leopardo Companies and GMA Construction Group is anticipated to begin work in Q1 2025 and open the converted space to new residents in Q1 2026. ",The Loop

Century and Consumers Buildings will be saved from demolition,"The GSA has released their Final Environmental Impact Statement which indicates their decision to not demolish the Century and Consumers buildings and look for a “viable” reuse plan. After $52 million in federal funds were approved to demolish the towers, the GSA and federal judges cited security and safety reasons for the Dirksen Courthouse as reasoning to clear this corner of the Loop. Built in 1915-16, the Century Building at 202 S. State is a strong example of an early 20th century commercial style building which was essentially an early urban mall, with shops on multiple levels where customers would pass through and shop. Designed by Holabird & Roche, the tower is designed with the fundamentals of the Chicago School with technological advancements that allowed for taller buildings with more glass and windows. The tower’s overall slenderness, narrow mullions, and recessed spandrel panels gave a sense of verticality to the building that was accentuated with its white glazed terracotta cladding.  Built just a few years earlier, the Consumers Building was completed in 1913 by developer Jacob L. Kesner, with Mundie and Jensen as the architects. Located at 220 S. State, the tower was built as a professional office building with extensive retail space on the lower floors. Also built in the commercial style with the tradition of Chicago School, the building’s steel frame is expressed by a more solid grid-like pattern of narrow, vertical piers and horizontal spandrel bands. The building also retains its lavish interior lobby, with carrera marble on the walls and ceilings with classical revival detailing. A marble staircase sits in an alcove while the space is adorned with decorative bronze fixtures.  During the federal government’s review process, the city underwent a long process of investigating landmark status, beginning with an overview and resolution to proceed reviewing the buildings, then a hearing where they did not advance a designation, then the Commission on Chicago Landmarks approved the preliminary landmark recommendation, and then a final landmark recommendation was approved. The buildings never became official city landmarks.  While the GSA has changed course and will not demolish the buildings, they have made a long list of stipulations for what they determine a “viable” reuse to be. Any proposal must meet all these criteria. -- 1. The Federal government must retain ownership interests to achieve its security objectives, as determined by the government in its discretion.  2. Occupancy/Use: Properties shall not be used for short-term or long-term residential or lodging, places of worship, or medical treatment, services, or research. No use that requires access to outdoor areas is permitted.  3. Access to the roof is restricted to maintenance and repair activities. Personnel and materials that will be present in this area shall be subject to clearance and controls necessary to meet court security objectives.  4. Developer would have no access or use rights to Quincy Court.  5. Loading is prohibited in Quincy Court and otherwise restricted in a manner to achieve court security. Loading on State or Adams Streets would be subject to local ordinance requirements. 6. Occupants and users of the buildings shall have no sight lines into the Dirksen Courthouse, the Dirksen Courthouse ramp, or the Quincy Court properties owned by GSA.  7. No parking or vehicle access is permitted on or within the properties.  8. Developer is responsible for staffing, at their expense, security 24 hours a day with personnel approved by the Federal Protective Service or an entity to whom security services are delegated by Federal Protective Service.   9. Developer must obtain and maintain access control systems to prevent unauthorized access to any location within the structures. Each exterior entrance point must have an intrusion detection system and access control system installed, and Developer must provide federal law enforcement access to each system.  10. Developer must install and maintain interior and exterior security cameras and provide federal law enforcement officials with access and the ability to monitor the feeds in real time.  11. Developer must install exterior lighting necessary to achieve courthouse security objectives. 12. Perimeter Security: Developer must prevent unauthorized access to the properties that would result in an unapproved sight line.  13. Fire escapes, and any other structures that would allow access from the street, must be removed.  14. All construction documents and specifications for any renovation, rehabilitation, modification, or construction of any portion of the building (interior or exterior) will be subject to review and approval by federal law enforcement agencies.  15. No project may start without the advance approval of GSA. -- As the GSA pursues a “viable” adaptive reuse, they will issue a Request for Lease Proposals to seek a reuse that meets the security needs of the Dirksen Courthouse.

PRC approves adaptive reuse at 111 W. Monroe,"The Permit Review Committee has approved the adaptive reuse of 111 W. Monroe. Planned by Prime/Capri Interest, LLC, made up of The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group, the developers acquired the building from BMO in the summer of 2022.

With Stantec on board for the design, the building will be converted into a mixed-use building, set to include 345 apartments, 226 hotel keys, and meeting/event space on the second floor. The roof level will be reactivated by reopening the original Monroe Club as an amenity for residents and hotel guests. The former mechanical penthouse will become a restaurant, with the outdoor deck including a pool.  The estimated $202.8 million project focuses on the residential conversion scope of the project. The 345 apartments will be spread across floors 13 through 20, with a large light well cut out of the center of the building to allow for natural light to reach the new apartments. At the middle of the building, two floors will be turned into a world-class spa and fitness center with an indoor pool, golf simulator, and fitness center.  The proposed unit mix would include 130 studios, 170 one-beds, and 45 two-beds. Of those, 40 studios, 50 one-beds, and five two-beds would be set aside as affordable ranging from 40-80% AMI.  Set to cost approximately $202.8 million, the residential conversion would be funded with $31.5 million in developer equity, $87.3 million in loans, $40 million in TIF funding, a $9 million deferred developer fee, and $35 million in tax credit equity.  With another milestone under their belt, the development team is moving forward with securing all the necessary approvals for the project. If approved, the developers plan to start construction in January 2025 and wrap up work by January 2027. ",The Loop
Renderings emerge for 208 S. LaSalle adaptive reuse,"Interior renderings have been revealed for The LaSalle Residences, an office-to-residential adaptive reuse project at 208 S. LaSalle St. in Chicago’s Loop. The renderings offer an early glimpse of the historic office building repurposed as market-rate and affordable residences and represent the first interior images to be released from any of the properties moving forward under the City of Chicago’s LaSalle Corridor Revitalization initiative. Led by Chicago-based developer The Prime Group, Inc., the plan for 208 S. LaSalle St. will repurpose roughly 222,500 square feet of office space on floors 13 to 16 into 226 apartments offered in studio, one- and two-bedroom floor plans. The LaSalle Residences will feature a new ground-floor lobby as well as residential amenities, including a state-of-the-art fitness facility; club-inspired tenant lounge spaces supporting coworking, meetings and social events; and penthouse-level community terraces with an outdoor pool and gathering areas overlooking the historic structure’s central atrium and offering panoramic views of the Loop’s iconic skyline. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative and Lucien Lagrange, the conversion will also upgrade all older mechanical systems with modern energy-efficient equipment and replace the existing single-pane windows with high-performance insulated glass. The mixed-income project will set aside 30% of the residences as affordable housing for qualifying individuals and families earning an average of 60% of the area mean income (AMI). The transit-oriented location is in the heart of Chicago’s central business district adjacent to the historic CTA Quincy station and within walking distance of other CTA stops, Metra commuter rail stations and Chicago Water Taxi service. Completed in 1914, the historic 1.2 million-square-foot, 22-story building at 208 S. LaSalle St. was initially designed by world-famous Chicago architect D.H. Burnham & Co. in the Classical Revival style for the Continental and Commercial National Bank. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007. “In addition to breathing new life into an under-utilized Chicago landmark, The LaSalle Residences will help bring back some of the 24/7 vibrancy to Chicago’s downtown financial district lost during and after the COVID pandemic,” said architect Alan Barker, principal and residential market leader at LJC. “The Loop is an amenity-rich area, but continued foot traffic is key to retaining and attracting retail business. Converting office space to 226 units at 208 LaSalle St. will not only enhance the built-in customer base for downtown retail and amenities, but it will also preserve a piece of Chicago’s architectural history.” The estimated total project cost is $130 million, and The Prime Group aims to start construction in early 2025, pending additional city approvals and permits.  ",The Loop
Lotte Hotels & Resorts opens L7 Hotel in Chicago,"Chicago-based McHugh Construction has completed the multimillion-dollar renovation of a 191-room, 14-story hotel at the corner of N. Wabash Ave and E. Wacker Pl in Chicago, which opened in June as L7 Chicago, South Korea-based Lotte Hotels & Resorts’ first L7-branded property in North America. McHugh also built out Perilla Korean American Steakhouse, the hotel’s anchor restaurant on the ground floor, as well as a new lobby. “We leaned into our extensive adaptive reuse experience to transform this 112-year-old building into Chicago’s first hotel dedicated to Korean culture and hospitality,” said Kathleen Arnold, McHugh project manager. “For instance, we maximized the project’s unusual crawlspaces and basement level to place ductwork and exhaust systems for the Korean BBQ grill tables used throughout the Perilla steakhouse.” In late August 2023, McHugh began demolition of the restaurant and lobby of the former Kimpton Hotel Monaco and erected temporary walls, so the hotel remained in operation throughout the renovation. Using a waterfall approach, McHugh started renovating the top floor in November 2023 and worked its way down one floor at a time. Hotel rooms, suites and corridors received new carpet, wall coverings, finishes and furniture; signature window seats in each room were reupholstered; and aqua-green tiles were installed on the wall alongside each guest room door. McHugh collaborated with interior designer New York-based AvroKO and project architect Chicago-based Grec Architects to create L7’s tranquil, calm atmosphere that is supported through a sage green and crème color palette. With an eye toward attracting millennials, the hotel’s lobby was designed with a relaxing living room vibe. McHugh achieved this aesthetic by replacing marble tiles with a wood floor laid in a block pattern and surrounding the lobby fireplace with aqua-green glazed tiles from floor to ceiling. Warm wood trim and acoustic tile were added to the walls of the lobby’s seating area, and forest green floor tiles cut in a radius design accent a seating area in the middle of the lobby. A reception desk made of carved wood complements the space. Opposite the lobby, the Perilla Korean American Steakhouse is filled with custom grill tables surrounded by banquette seating, a bar and a chef’s counter that offers a tasting menu. The steakhouse’s décor features a color scheme of plum, green and cream with acoustical panels to soften conversational noise levels. McHugh installed a black iron duct system connected to exhaust tubing at each grill table and added an air unit on the roof to pull in fresh outside air. Since the building is surrounded by high-rises, McHugh facilitated installation of the 25,000-pound air unit on the roof via helicopter. “Like many cities where we work, Chicago’s hospitality business is making a strong comeback. It’s this perfect blend of lifestyle and experiential travel, business travel, and recreational and political events that are all happening right now and have shined a spotlight on our growing hospitality division,” said Kate Ivanova, McHugh’s executive vice president who oversees McHugh’s robust hospitality portfolio of over 100 completed projects, including new construction and renovations for Four Seasons Hotel Chicago, Ritz-Carlton and Peninsula Chicago. “Of course, our experience and reputation in hotel renovations is certainly a benefit to our clients and is one of the reasons we were selected to transform this property into an L7 hotel.” Located steps from the Chicago Riverwalk and the Magnificent Mile, the 14-story building constructed in 1912 is one of 50 landmarks featured in Living Landmarks of Chicago and served as a hat factory and headquarters of D.B. Fisk Co., the largest wholesale millinery in the country until 1932. The building was converted to the Oxford House Hotel in the 1950s. Ironically, McHugh served as general contractor of its conversion to Hotel Monaco shortly after Kimpton acquired the building in 1999, and McHugh performed a refresh of the guest rooms around 2011. Lotte Hotels & Resorts acquired the property in 2022 and hired McHugh for its conversion to an L7 hotel. ",The Loop

On the ground floor, a residential lobby will be located along W. Washington St flanked by retail on each side. The office lobby will be retained along N. LaSalle St with back of house space along W. Calhoun Pl which acts as an alley. Residents will have access to a mail room and bike room for 124 bikes behind the residential lobby. Outside, new landscaping and seating will be added with a dog run along the west side of the building. On the second floor, the conversion will include leasing offices as well as a resident lounge and coworking space. Another bike room with space for an additional 97 bikes and mechanical space will round out the floor.  With 23 units per floor typically, the project’s 349 units will be split into 222 studios, 98 one-beds, and 29 two-beds. Of those, 66 studios, 30 one-beds, and nine two-beds will be set aside as affordable between 40-80% AMI.  The exterior of the building will remain largely the same, except for the installation of new windows at the residential units. On the 11th floor, residents will have access to a new projecting terrace that will feature a variety of seating areas and fire pits.  The interior of the 11th floor will have a resident lounge, party room, fitness center, and locker rooms.  The $135 million project will be funded by $25.5 million in equity, $51 million in loans, $57 million in TIF funding, and a $1.5 million deferred developer fee.  With underwriting underway, the approval secured from the Community Development Commission will allow for negotiations to continue with the Department of Housing as they draft a redevelopment agreement. The plan will need final approval from the City Council before the proposal is fully approved. If approved, the developer plans to begin construction in March 2025 and complete the project by January 2027. ",The Loop
Renderings: New computer science building headed to UIC,"The University of Illinois Chicago is gearing up to begin work on a new 135,000-square-foot computer science building. Known as the Computer Design, Research, and Learning Center or CDRLC, the $117.8 million project will replace a parking lot at 900 W. Taylor Street. The upcoming facility will double the capacity of the school's computer science program and consolidate the department within a single building. The structure calls for 15 classrooms, 35 labs, an auditorium, offices for student affairs, and an undergraduate learning and community center—all connected by a five-story atrium grafted onto the existing Engineering Research Facility at neighboring 842 W. Taylor Street. The new building comes from Seattle's LMN Architects and Chicago-based architect of record Booth Hansen. The design features a ""muscular precast concrete and terra cotta facade,"" which draws inspiration from the school's late modernist eastern campus designed in 1965 by Walter Netsch, according to LMN's website. The project aims to achieve LEED Gold certification and will utilize geothermal technology for both heating and cooling. Construction on the Computer Design, Research, and Learning Center is supported by Gov. Pritzker's Rebuild Illinois capital investment plan. ""As Chicago's only public research university—and one of the most diverse universities in the country—we're making investments to further cement UIC's place as a national leader, propelling it into the future,"" said Pritzker at a groundbreaking event earlier this month. That groundbreaking ceremony, however, was just that—ceremonial. No permits have been issued for the project, and the parking lot where the new building will rise is currently fully intact. According to UIC, the Computer Design Research and Learning Center is expected to open to students in summer 2023. The CDRLC is the third recent addition to UIC's east campus. It follows the Engineering Innovation Building and the Academic and Residential Complex, which both opened in 2019. The university also intends to break ground (at some point) on its $95 million Center of the Arts designed by New York architecture firm OMA and Chicago's KOO LLC. ",University Village
Next phase of Roosevelt Square will bring 222 apartments to Little Italy,"Chicago developer Related Midwest is preparing to move forward with the next stage of its mixed-income Roosevelt Square project to revitalize 137 acres of mostly vacant Chicago Housing Authority and city-owned land in the Little Italy neighborhood.  The latest phase of the project—known internally as phase 3B—calls for a trio of new-construction mid-rise buildings with a total of 207 apartments, plus 15 units in a rehabbed historic building that will also contain a new home for the National Public Housing Museum. Nearly 100 of the new apartments will be offered at market-rate, while 80 apartments will be reserved for CHA families. The remaining 45 units will be set aside as affordable and workforce housing for residents earning 60 to 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Related also plans to update and modernize an additional 184 existing units located in the first phase of Roosevelt Square during this time. When complete, the Roosevelt Square project will bring more than 2,400 mixed-income units to the former site of the demolished ABLA Homes. ""The key to the redevelopment is replacing isolated public housing buildings with integrated high-quality homes that are available to all members of the community, regardless of income,"" said Related's Michael Kaplan at a virtual community meeting earlier this month. 1237 & 1357 W. Roosevelt Road These ""sister"" buildings will rise six stories and contain 70 apartments each. Designed by architecture firm DesignBridge, the structures will use textured precast and metal panels to create a ""dynamic layering effect"" on their similar (but not identical) exteriors. The lobbies, amenities, and management offices will be located on the ground floor and face Roosevelt Road to bring active uses to the streetfront. A dog park, grilling stations, and 41 parking spaces will be located at the rear of each structure. 1002 S. Racine Avenue Designed by Landon Bone Baker Architects and Moody Nolan, the third new construction building will rise along Taylor Street between Racine Avenue and Lytle Street. Also set to rise six stories, the proposed mid-rise structure features traditional brick cladding on its base and modern panels for its set-back upper levels. New retail space will run the length of Taylor Street and there will be 34 parking spaces available at the rear of the building.  National Public Housing Museum The fourth building of Roosevelt Square's third phase doesn't involve new construction but rather the sole surviving remaining remnant of the demolished Jane Addams Homes. Designed by architect John Holabird in 1938, the masonry structure at the corner of Taylor and Ada streets will be rehabilitated into a long-discussed new home for the National Public Housing Museum. Fifteen mixed-income apartments will occupy the historic building's northern wing.  The soon-to-be repurposed building is located across the street from the Roosevelt Square Library and Taylor Street Apartments. Completed in 2019 during phase 3A of Roosevelt Square, the eight-story structure from Skidmore, Owings & Merrill includes a new Little Italy Chicago Public Library branch topped by 73 mixed-income apartments. This week Related Midwest filed a zoning application for Phase 3B of Roosevelt Square with the city. The proposal will need the support of the Chicago Plan Commission and City Council before construction can begin. If approved, the developer expects to complete the work sometime in 2023. ""This has been a long road to get to where we can build at Roosevelt Square,"" said Related Midwest President Curt Bailey at this month's virtual meeting. ""We are so excited to get started on this important development.""       ",University Village

A new marquee will protrude over the entrance, spanning the inset center section of the facade. The marquee will feature a white backlit sign with individual black letters. On the underside, socket-style lights will harken back to the original historic marquee of the building.  The $10.4 million development will be funded with $1.6 million in equity, $3.6 million in lender financing, $125,000 from an Adopt-A-Landmark grant, and $5 million in TIF funding. With funding approved by City Council, the project is another step closer to coming to fruition.

Black Ensemble Theater adjusts mixed-use development plan at 4427 N. Clark,"The Black Ensemble Theater has revised their plan for the Free to Be Village, their proposed mixed-use development plan at 4427 N. Clark. Planned for a site across the street from their existing space at 4450 N. Clark, the new building will rise at approximately 4427 N. Clark, replacing the one-story building that used to house the Japanese American Services Center and a parking lot. Designed by Gensler, the project is aimed at bringing an arts and cultural destination to Uptown while forwarding Black Ensemble Theater’s goals of eradicating racism through the arts. The original plan for the development called for a six-story residential building with a performing arts center attached. In response to concerns about the building height, its setback from the alley, and casting shadows onto the neighbors, the project was cut by one floor down to 59 feet in height from an originally planned 70-foot-tall building. The new design varies its setback from the alley and consolidated loading into one loading dock instead of two.  The revised five-story scheme will include a 14,000-square-foot Performing Arts Education Center, 7,000-square-foot Media and Technology Center, and 14,000 square feet of retail space. The residential component has actually increased from 50 to 53 affordable residential units designated for artists. Down from 92, there will be 89 parking spaces located at-grade along the alley and in a single level of underground parking. 53 bike parking spaces will be included in the building.  The ground floor of the building provides a literary cafe at the corner of the site near the intersection of W. Sunnyside Ave and N. Clark St, with the lobby to the performing arts education center to the south of it. A small portion of the retail sits just south of the performing arts education center lobby with the bulk of it occupying the southern end of the site. The residential lobby is accessed midway along the street frontage through the planned outdoor space along the street. With Site Design Group in charge of the landscaping, the project’s open space at the center of the site is viewed as the heart of the building, as a space to connect with the community and have them connect with the programming in the building. With two levels of public space, the design calls for a sloped walkway that creates an amphitheater of seating and planters to connect the public plaza to a public rooftop deck on the second floor. To close the upper terrace at night, a perforated screen wall creates an opportunity for commissioning an art piece or mural. The owner is seeking to rezone the site from C1-2 to B3-3 with a Planned Development designation. Approvals will be needed from Alderman Clay, the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and City Council. Construction is intended to begin on the Studio Theater in Q4 2024, while construction of the first phase of the Free to Be Village Phase 1 would begin in Q2 2026. Both components would then finish construction in Q3 2027. ",Uptown

"UChicago, UChicago Medicine, and City Colleges of Chicago announce healthcare development","The University of Chicago and UChicago Medicine joined City Colleges of Chicago recently to announce plans for a joint project that would create new jobs and establish healthcare career pathways for South Side residents. The multifaceted project would be built on currently underutilized land on Garfield Boulevard, between the Green Line station and Washington Park. The project, which has been guided by community input, includes two related elements. On a vacant parcel of land owned by the University of Chicago, UChicago Medicine plans to build a new facility that consolidates its existing clinical labs, modernizes their operations, and maximizes lab test efficiency to ensure best-in-class care. In the second part of the project, directly west of the proposed UChicago Medicine lab facility, City Colleges of Chicago would build a new learning center for Malcolm X College. The new facility would be built on land owned by the Chicago Transit Authority, immediately east of the Garfield Green Line station. The connected projects would provide an on-ramp and clear pathway to careers in the health sciences for South Side residents, accelerating their ability to secure in-demand positions that pay well, are available at UChicago Medicine and other South Side hospitals, and are accessible with a one- to two-year degree. Together, the facilities would support approximately 600 jobs, including 200 newly created positions at UChicago Medicine. The Malcolm X College Learning Center in Washington Park will serve up to 800 students and establish the first clinical lab technician program in Chicago. The proposed Malcolm X Learning Center is part of a broader City Colleges plan to support more South Side residents interested in pursuing healthcare careers. City Colleges also will bring a full nursing pathway to Kennedy-King College in Englewood, which will include an associate degree in nursing and a licensed practical nursing program operated by Malcolm X College at KKC, and a basic nursing assistant program and general education courses operated by Kennedy-King College.  The project will help meet the significant and growing demand from local employers who have contended with a shortage of qualified candidates for clinical lab technician roles in recent years. UChicago Medicine often struggles to hire qualified candidates for its clinical lab tech positions, with positions remaining vacant longer than other healthcare roles. The scarcity of qualified candidates is even greater for South Side safety net hospitals. Each year, there are approximately 500 job openings for medical laboratory positions in Chicago, 1,000 in Illinois, and 25,000 across the country. The proximity to UChicago Medicine’s clinical labs will create experiential learning opportunities for Malcolm X College students and job prospects for future graduates. Students enrolled in the clinical lab tech program, for example, will get real-world experience through a clinical rotation at UChicago Medicine. The Malcolm X College Learning Center would include classrooms, dry labs, office space, and retail space at the street level, as well as support approximately 50 full-time and part-time employees.  The UChicago Medicine facility would support 550 jobs—including approximately 200 new positions—and help the hospital add critical lab capacity to meet the expanded diagnostic needs of a new cancer pavilion, expected to open in 2027. Each of the facilities will include new ground floor retail space to provide opportunities for local businesses and serve residents, employees, and students, as well as other foot traffic stemming from the Garfield Green Line station. The project also includes a parking structure for students and employees. ",Washington Park

City Council approves purchase of shuttered Aldi in West Garfield Park,"City Council has approved the plans to purchase the abruptly-closed Aldi in West Garfield Park. As part of its steps to help get a grocery store back to the West Garfield Park neighborhood, the City of Chicago has taken this step to allow the Department of Planning and Development to enter into a negotiated site acquisition agreement. First reported by Austin Weekly News, the store shuttered abruptly at the beginning of October 2021. After serving the neighborhood for over 30 years, the closure has left the neighborhood severely void of grocery stores. After discussions with Aldi, city officials reported in the December 2021 Community Development Commission meeting that Aldi will not reopen the location. The now-approved acquisition authority comes as part of the city’s strategy to get a grocer back into the retail space. While the city is not buying the plot at this time, the authority allows the city to quickly pivot to do so if that becomes their designated strategy. Currently, the city and DPD is actively referring grocers to the site’s broker to get a new grocery tenant as quickly as possible. If the city decides to pursue the purchase of the parcel, the city would pay $700,000 for the property and would allow them to control the re-tenanting process. Aldi is reportedly aware of the city’s move to potentially purchase the site and would engage in the sale. The acquisition goal would be to further help facilitate re-tenanting. DPD is looking to work with the local community to ensure the new use of the property meets the community’s needs. ",West Garfield Park

Proposed by Sulo Development and Sterling Bay, the project site is  a full block site along W. Fulton St from N. Elizabeth St to N. Ada St. Currently a vacant property, the site was previously envisioned as an office development site. With New York-based KPF teaming up with local Park Fowler Plus, the project’s design consists of three towers on the site, with one on each corner and one centered along W. Fulton St. The building’s will have their individual residential lobbies at their base with a restaurant located midblock under the center tower. Two motor courts are located between the three buildings and connect into the parking podium that will hold a total of 364 parking spaces for the buildings.

The center tower, located in Subarea B, will hold 54 condos in a 301-foot-tall tower. The western tower, situated in Subarea C, will be the largest building, holding 106 condos in a 538-foot-tall building. Outdoor amenity decks will be located on top of the parking podium that stretches across the entire site. As a residential development, affordability requirements still apply for the condominium project. In lieu of building affordable units, the developers will pay a fee in-lieu of approximately $5.3 million to cover their affordability requirement. To allow for the scope of the project, the developers are seeking to rezone the site from M2-3 to DX-7 with an overall Planned Development designation. The team will pay into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to get an additional 4.5 FAR bonus.

Further details emerge for development at 1060 W. Van Buren,"Further details have been outlined for the residential development planned at 1060 W. Van Buren as the developer presented their plans to the community. Planned by F & F Realty Partners, the project site includes the existing building at the corner of S. Aberdeen St and W. Van Buren as well as the surface parking lot and small one-story metal structure to the north of it. Designed by FitzGerald, the design will convert the historic industrial building designed by Daniel Burnham into apartments while adding a new 26-story tower on the northern portion of the site. The new tower will have a podium that matches the height datum of the existing building clad in a glass and masonry design. Topping out at 290 feet, the remainder of the L-shaped residential tower above will be clad in metal and glass with corner balconies.  A six-story volume will be situated between the new and existing buildings clad in glass as a buffer between the two while also connecting them with one cohesive main entrance. With the north wall up against the lot line, a mural is proposed for the facade because the design cannot include any windows.  With a total of 325 units, the 8-story masonry building will have 111 units with the remaining 214 units in the new tower. The unit mix is expected to include 60 studios, 34 studio pluses, 119 one-beds, 58 one-bed pluses, 51 two-beds, and 2 three-beds. To meet ARO requirements, 65 of the units will be set aside as affordable. 106 parking spaces will be included in the new building and 339 bike parking spaces will also be provided. To allow for the project, the developers are seeking to rezone the property from DS-3 to DX-7 with an overall Planned development designation. To allow for an additional 4.3 FAR, the development team would pay $2.7 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.  The project and its community feedback will be reviewed by Alderman Conway before he gives his final position on the project. If he approves it, the team would file a zoning application and hope to go before the Chicago Plan Commission before the end of the year. Construction could start in the middle or end of 2025 with construction expected to last for 22-24 months. ",West Loop
City Council approves residential addition at 112 S. Sangamon,"The Chicago City Council has approved a zoning application for a residential addition at 112 S. Sangamon. Located midblock between W.

With City Council approval secured, the site will get a new Type 1 zoning amendment to allow for the scope of the development under the site’s existing DX-5 zoning. ",West Loop
Permit issued for adaptive reuse at 801 W. Madison,"A renovation permit has been issued for the adaptive reuse of the former Mid-City Trust & Savings Bank Building. Located at 801 W. Madison, the building occupies the southwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Halsted St. Purchased in 2022, Experiential Capital Group is leading the redevelopment of the building. With Pappageorge Haymes Partners serving as the architect, the project will rehabilitate the exterior and convert the interior into a hotel operated by The Neighborhood Hotel with commercial space on the ground floor. The landmark building’s significant features are designated as all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as the interior entrance lobby of the main banking hall, including skylights, original check desks and counters, and historic lighting. On the exterior, the rehabilitation will clean, repair, and repaint the historic bronze windows on the first and second floors. Non-historic windows on the third through sixth floors will be repaired and replaced if they are beyond repair. A new entrance canopy along W. Madison St will be added for the hotel entrance and exterior uplighting will be installed on the building’s facade. A mural is proposed for a portion of the common brick on the west elevation, with historic preservation staff recommending the use of vapor permeable paint or attaching mural panels onto the masonry to prevent damage to the brick facade. On the interior, the rehab will retain historic features of the banking hall. The hotel’s main entrance will be at the northwest end of the building’s W. Madison St frontage, with the main entry to ground floor space at the northeast corner. A new passenger and service elevator will be added. A glass partition between interior columns will enclose the monumental stair for the hotel space to separate it from the rest of the ground floor banking hall space.  The elevator lobby and main corridors of the upper floors will be retained, and the existing door locations will be used for the hotel rooms wherever possible. The historic skylight will be modified and renovated to add a new daylighting system over the exterior skylight structure and a new translucent acoustical panel system will be added on the interior that will have the appearance of glazing.  With the permit issued, general contractor Bulley & Andrews can begin the interior renovation work to convert the building into hotel rooms. The hotel is expected to open sometime in 2025. ",West Loop

Plan Commission approves revised development at 1016 W. Jackson,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved Mavrek Development’s revised proposal for a mixed-use development at 1016 W. Jackson. Located just west of the intersection of W. Jackson Blvd and S. Morgan St, the new version of the proposal includes the corner parcel next to the original site. The new development would replace an existing five-story office building, a two-story commercial structure, and a large parking lot.  Designed by Eckenhoff Saunders, the revised development cuts the tower’s height by three floors going from 28 floors to 25 stories, resulting in a 20-foot haircut to 275 feet down from 295 feet. An additional 10 residential units will result in 380 apartments with 76 affordable apartments. With a grocery store now part of the proposal, the retail square footage will increase from 6,500 square feet to 23,000 square feet. Parking has also increased from 125 to 163 parking stalls.  The revised design for the project refines the original design language with a gridded metal facade volume intersecting a glass volume. The design uses a corten steel frame with a glass and aluminum glazing system. In this revised version, the glass volume wraps around to the north facade to lighten the massing of the building as seen from the north. The project’s podium has been designed with two facade expressions to break up the long frontage along W. Jackson Blvd. The dark toned brick of the corner volume of the building contrasts with the gridded metal facade used on the tower portion of the site.  On the ground floor, the majority of the enlarged floor plan will be used by the grocery tenant who hasn’t been officially announced. The paseo will lead back to the residential entry and has been redesigned without columns to address safety concerns and allow for more light to enter the area. Parking access and loading for the grocer will be from S. Morgan St with loading access for residents from the alley. A bike room for 188 bikes is also included. With the zoning application filed and, in the works, Mavrek is seeking to incorporate the new parcel into the Planned Development and rezone that site from DS-3 into the unified DX-5 of the project. With approval from the Chicago Plan Commission secured, the $100 million development can now go before the Committee on Zoning and full City Council to get final approval. ",West Loop

City Council approves Class L for 801 W. Madison,"The Chicago City Council has approved a Class L tax incentive for the adaptive reuse of the former Mid-City Trust & Savings Bank Building. Located at 801 W. Madison, the building occupies the southwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Halsted St. Purchased in 2022, Experiential Capital Group is leading the redevelopment of the building. With Pappageorge Haymes Partners serving as the architect, the project will rehabilitate the exterior and convert the interior into a hotel operated by The Neighborhood Hotel with commercial space on the ground floor. The landmark building’s significant features are designated as all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as the interior entrance lobby of the main banking hall, including skylights, original check desks and counters, and historic lighting. On the exterior, the rehabilitation will clean, repair, and repaint the historic bronze windows on the first and second floors. Non-historic windows on the third through sixth floors will be repaired and replaced if they are beyond repair. A new entrance canopy along W.

Amtrak wants public input on Union Station redesign,"Amtrak is in the process of reimaging the concourse at Chicago’s Union Station and is seeking input from the traveling public, station users, and local residents. Open through the end of the month, those who are interested can fill out the survey at this link. “The station first opened in 1925 and Amtrak will involve our partners and the general public to develop a preferred design that will take us into the next hundred years,” said Jeannie Kwon, Amtrak Vice President, Mega Programs Development and Coordination. “The work at Chicago Union Station, our most critical linchpin for travel across the national network, will be performed using federal capital funds along with generous contributions from our partners for both the design and construction elements of the project.” This is the design for the first major enhancement at track level and above since 1991 in a station that serves tens of thousands of Amtrak and Metra customers daily. It is an element of CHIP, the Chicago Hub Improvement Program, which has been repeatedly endorsed by state, regional and federal leaders. When the current concourse design was finished 32 years ago, Amtrak had an annual passenger count of 2.3 million in Chicago. In 2019, that total was 3.3 million, with new routes to and from Chicago in development in Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, among other Amtrak Midwest states. Annual Metra ridership, over the same period at Chicago Union Station, has grown from 26.6 million to 32.6 million. “We will continue, with our partners at Metra, the City of Chicago, Cook County, the states of Illinois and Michigan, among others, to pursue all viable funding avenues. This includes, but is not limited to, pursuing grant opportunities to help fund the construction to rework the Concourse and deliver a state of the art, first-class station that mirrors the stature of a premier city,” said Barney Gray, Amtrak Assistant Vice President for Major Stations. Leading the design team at this Amtrak-owned station is Chicago-based Epstein, in partnership with FXCollaborative. This partnership combines Epstein’s expertise in managing large, multi-faceted teams on complicated public facilities with New York-based FXCollaborative’s design experience on transportation projects. This is one of several major infrastructure projects Amtrak’s newest department, Capital Delivery, is advancing. Amtrak is investing in modern trains, updated stations, new tunnels and bridges, and other critical infrastructure upgrades. They’re enhancing the customer experience across the country, improving safety and reliability, driving economic development, reducing trip times, expanding capacity, advancing accessibility and promoting a more sustainable future.

Skender complete buildout of offices for Fetch,"Skender has completed the interior buildout of a new Chicago office for Fetch, the nation's No. 1 rewards app and leading consumer-engagement platform, founded in Madison, Wisconsin. The 20,000+-square-foot workspace spans the top three floors at 609 W. Randolph, a new West Loop office building completed in 2022 and built by Skender as general contractor. The finished space features 60 open-concept workstations, three café areas, three all-gender restrooms, 19 conference rooms, 17 phone rooms and a game room outfitted with arcade machines and a pool table. To meet Fetch’s need for an all-hands space, two of the conference rooms can be combined through the use of an operable partition, then further combined with the neighboring café via the rollup of two glass doors, creating one large integrated area for all-company meetings and events. Additionally, the AV systems in the all-hands space are set up to function seamlessly as both individual rooms and as one cohesive room, a complex programming process that required the company to have its own AV network.  “This move gives Fetch ample room to grow and stretch out,” said Brian Eddy, Project Manager at Skender. “Our team seamlessly embraced the challenges presented by the simultaneous construction on three separate floors as well as the complexities of the AV system setup. Fetch employees now have a modern new office that caters to many kinds of work styles.” “As a remote-first hybrid company, Fetch empowers employees to design flexible work arrangements tailored to their role, and we've structured our operations to maximize collaboration across virtual and in-person environments,” said Rachel Olchowka, Chief People Officer at Fetch. “Physical office space plays a key role in our work and culture by serving as a hub where employees can come together to foster innovation, strengthen connections, and bring our shared values to life.” Construction started in March 2023 and wrapped up on time in July. In addition to Skender’s role as general contractor, the project team consisted of architect BOX Studios; Lumen Workplace acted as owner’s representative; the engineering and LV engineering was completed by Cosentini and Engineering Plus respectively; CBRE acted as broker.

Permits are in the works for 566 W. Van Buren,"New construction permits have been filed for the planned new mixed-use development at 566 W. Van Buren. Planned by Riverside Investment & Development and Bluestar Properties, the project was previously occupied by a three-story masonry building and a two-story masonry building which were both recently demolished. The rest of the site is currently a surfacing parking lot. With a design from Antunovich Associates, the new 14-story tower will rise 155 feet within the site’s existing DX-7 zoning. The new development will deliver 198 residential units with 2,500 square feet of retail on the ground floor facing the intersection of W. Van Buren St and S. Jefferson St. The residential lobby will front W. Van Buren St, with balconies rising above on the south facade. Planned with a mix of studios, junior one-beds, one-beds, one-bed plus dens, and two-beds, residents will have access to a suite of rooftop amenities including a fitness center, co-working space, and a club room. On an exterior rooftop deck, residents will have access to a rooftop pool and grilling stations. On the ground floor, a dog run and dog spa are located behind the parking ramp along the alley. Parking for residents will total 76 car parking spaces and 99 bicycle spaces. Parking access for 24 cars on the ground floor will be via the public alley, with a parking ramp off of S. Jefferson St for the remaining 52 spaces on the second floor. The building has been designed to fit into the context of the West Loop neighborhood incorporating a brick and glass façade. The parking floors are clad with translucent glass and the ground floor will be set back approximately 2 feet from the property line to provide a wider sidewalk with new street planters and trees along both Jefferson and Van Buren Streets. The existing curb cut on Van Buren Street has been removed and the Jefferson Street curb cut has been reduced by 5’ for the parking entrance. The project is being developed as an as-of-right development which means that the building fits under the existing zoning rights. Since no formal city approvals are required, the developers can move forward with construction once permits are issued. While a timeline for completion is currently unknown, Lendlease has been tapped to serve as the general contractor. ",West Loop Gate
The Warehouse is officially a Chicago landmark,"The Chicago City Council has officially designated The Warehouse as a Chicago Landmark. Located at 206 S. Jefferson, the building, built in 1910, was home to a local dance club that became the birthplace of House music. According to a landmarks staff report, the building meets Criterion 1 for its value as an example of architectural, cultural, economic, historic, or social heritage. As the home of The Warehouse from 1977 to 1982, the dance club was the birthplace of house, a genre of dance music characterized by a driving beat, emotive lyrics and lush orchestration drawn from a number of genres including disco, R&B, gospel and techno. The Warehouse is also culturally significant to Chicago’s LGBTQ, Black and Latino community as the first supporters of house music at The Warehouse and who found a sense of community, self-expression and hope in The Warehouse’s revolutionary music. Over time, The Warehouse became popular with a broad range of Chicago club goers, and it was one of the first venues that broke down the barriers between gay and straight club scenes. Meeting Criterion 3 for its identification with a significant person, The Warehouse is significant for its association with DJ Frankie Knuckles, influential American DJ, record producer, and remix artist, who significantly contributed to the music culture of the City of Chicago and the United States as the “Godfather of house music.” DJ Frankie Knuckles, one of Chicago’s cultural pioneers, created house by transforming existing songs by extending, combining and overlapping them to create completely new experiences of music. Knuckles also used analog and digital technologies to alter songs to make them more up-tempo and danceable. The building also meets the Integrity Criterion as the design and materials of the building are intact from The Warehouse’s tenure between 1977 and 1982. The neighborhood context is somewhat altered by new construction, but many industrial loft buildings from the period of The Warehouse survive. The significant features of the building will be designated as all exterior elevations, including rooflines.  With the landmark designation approved, the building is officially saved from demolition. The current owners have expressed their intent to keep the building as an office building, with it currently occupied by a few office tenants.  ",West Loop Gate

Knuckles also used analog and digital technologies to alter songs to make them more up-tempo and danceable. The building also meets the Integrity Criterion as the design and materials of the building are intact from The Warehouse’s tenure between 1977 and 1982. The neighborhood context is somewhat altered by new construction, but many industrial loft buildings from the period of The Warehouse survive. The significant features of the building will be designated as all exterior elevations, including rooflines.  With the preliminary landmark recommendation approved, the building is tentatively saved from demolition. Landmarks staff will work on the report before voting on a final landmark recommendation to send to City Hall. The designation will need approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. The current owners have expressed their intent to keep the building as an office building, with it currently occupied by a few office tenants.  ",West Loop Gate
City Council approves 640 W. Randolph,"The Chicago City Council has approved a new mixed-use tower at 640 W. Randolph. Planned by Vista Property Group, the new building would occupy a corner site near the developer’s recently completed 609 W. Randolph. Currently a surface parking lot, the site is located at the northwest corner of W. Randolph St and N. Desplaines St.  Designed by Antunovich Associates, the new mixed-use building will rise 15 floors, holding approximately 2,500 square feet of retail space and roughly 117,00 square feet of office space across 12 floors. Standing 225 feet high, the building will include 19 parking spaces on the second floor, a ground floor bike room, and rooftop amenities that include a club room, outdoor terrace, fitness center, and meeting center. Occupying a narrow site, the building has been designed with a modern loft aesthetic, with the use of brick and divided-lite windows. The facade has been designed to have a higher percentage of glass than 609 W. Randolph and each office floor will have a private, west-facing terrace. The west facade underwent major changes when the building core was shifted towards the interior of the building, allowing for active space and vision glass along the west facade. Previously, the west facade was a concrete shear wall, but now has been articulated with brick and punched window openings. On the ground floor, the retail space will hold the corner, with the office lobby fronting W. Randolph St. The bike room for tenants will also be accessible from W. Randolph St at the westernmost end of its street frontage. The rest of the ground floor will hold back-of-house spaces along the alley with the parking and loading access from the alley. The parking ramp was relocated to the alley instead of opening onto N. Desplaines St in response to feedback from Alderman Reilly. To meet sustainability requirements, the building will exceed energy code, exceed the stormwater ordinance by 50%, is located in proximity to transit, will provide bike parking, plant trees, reduce indoor water use, install EV charging stations, install a CTA digital display, ensure construction waste diversion, and implement bird protection. The developers will pay $1.3 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to receive a 4.5 FAR bonus. With the green light from the Chicago City Council, the project is fully entitled and the developers can move forward towards construction. W.E O’Neil will be serving as the general contractor for the project. ",West Loop Gate
Mixed-use proposal planned at 135 N. Desplaines,"A mixed-use proposal is being planned at 135 N. Desplaines. Planned by Rogers Park Holdings LLC, the site is located at the southeast corner of W. Randolph St and N. Desplaines. Currently a vacant surface lot, the site will be cleared to make way for the new development.   While the architect has not been announced, the new building is set to rise nine floors, containing ground floor retail space and 50 residential units on the upper floors. Based on the renderings, the building will be clad in a mix of brick masonry and glass, with projecting balconies on the street-facing elevations.  With a unique lot size and shape, the developers will be going to the Zoning Board of Appeals to receive variations to reduce the rear setbacks of the building, to reduce the required parking from 18 down to 3 spaces, and to allow a driveway access to the first-floor garage from N. Desplaines St. The site does not have any alley access. According to Alderman Reilly’s newsletter, the proposal will head to the ZBA later this month to receive its variances. If approved, the project would be allowed to proceed with permitting and construction. A timeline for the development has not been announced.  ",West Loop Gate

Office tower proposed for 640 W. Randolph,"Developer Vista Property Group has proposed a new mixed-use tower at 640 W. Randolph. Revealed via Alderman Reilly’s newsletter to constituents, the new building would occupy a corner site near the developer’s recently completed 609 W. Randolph. Currently a surface parking lot, the site is located at the northwest corner of W. Randolph St and N. Desplaines St.  Designed by Antunovich Associates, the new mixed-use building will rise 15 floors, holding approximately 2,500 square feet of retail space and roughly 117,00 square feet of office space across 12 floors. Standing 225 feet high, the building will include 19 parking spaces on the second floor, a ground floor bike room, and rooftop amenities that include a club room, outdoor terrace, fitness center, and meeting center. Occupying a narrow site, the building has been designed with a modern loft aesthetic, with the use of brick and divided-lite windows. The facade has been designed to have a higher percentage of glass than 609 W. Randolph and each office floor will have a private, west-facing terrace. As a result of feedback from the alderman, multiple changes have been made to the original proposal. The retail entry was relocated to the W. Randolph St frontage to further activate that street and the parking ramp was relocated to the alley instead of opening onto N. Desplaines St. The west facade underwent major changes when the building core was shifted towards the interior of the building, allowing for active space and vision glass along the west facade. Previously, the west facade was a concrete shear wall, but now has been articulated with brick and punched window openings. Since the developer is requesting a 4.5 FAR bonus, the development will be required to be approved as a Planned Development and will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. A presentation before the Committee on Design is also possible. While a timeline for construction has not been shared, W.E O’Neil will be serving as the general contractor for the project.

Demo permits issued for 566 W. Van Buren,"Two demolition permits have been issued to clear the way for a new mixed-use development at 566 W. Van Buren. Planned by Riverside Investment & Development and Bluestar Properties, the permits will demolish a three-story masonry building and a two-story masonry building, both fronting W. Van Buren St. The rest of the site is currently a surfacing parking lot. With a design from Antunovich Associates, the new 14-story tower will rise 155 feet within its current DX-7 zoning. The new development will deliver 198 residential units with 2,500 square feet of retail on the ground floor facing the intersection of W. Van Buren St and S. Jefferson St. The residential lobby will front W. Van Buren St, with balconies rising above on the south facade. Planned with a mix of studios, junior one-beds, one-beds, one-bed plus dens, and two-beds, residents will have access to a suite of rooftop amenities including a fitness center, co-working space, and a club room. On an exterior rooftop deck, residents will have access to a rooftop pool and grilling stations. On the ground floor, a dog run and dog spa are located behind the parking ramp along the alley. Parking for residents will total 76 car parking spaces and 99 bicycle spaces. Parking access for 24 cars on the ground floor will be via the public alley, with a parking ramp off of S. Jefferson St for the remaining 52 spaces on the second floor. The building has been designed to fit into the context of the West Loop neighborhood incorporating a brick and glass façade. The parking floors are clad with translucent glass and the ground floor will be set back approximately 2 feet from the property line to provide a wider sidewalk with new street planters and trees along both Jefferson and Van Buren Streets. The existing curb cut on Van Buren Street has been removed and the Jefferson Street curb cut has been reduced by 5’ for the parking entrance. The project is being developed as an as-of-right development which means that the building fits under the existing zoning rights. Since no formal city approvals are required, the developers have moved forward to begin construction. With Lendlease tapped as the general contractor, Atlas Industries has been hired for the demolition. A timeline for completion has not been announced.  ",West Loop Gate
CoD reviews 655 W. Madison,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the two-tower office plan for 655 W. Madison. Located along the Kennedy Expressway, the project site is a full-block lot bound by W. Madison St, N. Desplaines St, W. Monroe St, and the highway. Conceived by The John Buck Company, the project is targeted at office tenants flocking to high quality Class-A office space within the city. Designed as a collaboration between JGMA and HOK, the development consists of 1.5 million square feet of office space situated within two towers rising 39 and 29 stories. Retail and restaurant space will activate the ground floor, while parking will occupy three floors of the podium. Atop the podium, a one-acre rooftop park has been designed by Site Design Group, with multiple amenity offerings connected to the park on that floor.  The project’s massing began as an extrusion of the site that was carved out to create a void between the two towers whose heights have been staggered. At the base, a sense of human scale has been added, with the towers having been separated visually from the podium. The tower masses have been carved to angle away from each other with the horizontal orientation of the floor plates accentuated with enlarged spandrels.  Driven by the expectations of Class-A commercial high-rise development, the towers have been developed with distinctive floor plates that measure 30,000 square feet on the low-rise portions and 27,000 square feet on the high-rise levels. Balconies will be included on the west elevation on every third floor. Each office floor will have its own isolated exhaust and intake air for the HVAC system, never mixing air between floors inside the building. The articulated spandrels on the tower act as functional gills to provide the fresh air for each floor. At the ground floor, the site design will shift as Phase 1 and Phase 2 are built over time. The lobby for the northern tower will face the intersection of W. Madison St and N. Desplaines St, pulled back from the property line to increase sidewalk space. A retail space will occupy the northwest corner of the floor plate and a large restaurant space will face onto N. Desplaines St with a wide sidewalk space for outdoor dining. After Phase 1 is complete, an entry plaza will occupy the footprint of Phase 2 while it is awaiting construction. Once construction on Phase 2 is complete, the southern tower’s lobby will occupy its respective corner, continuing the building setback to create a generous outdoor space. Parking and loading access will be off the western end of W. Monroe St. The discussion began with Lesley Roth asking about the treatment of the exposed walls that will face the open footprint of Phase 2 before it is constructed. The development team commented that they are looking at the need to enclose the podium on the southern side and have yet to determine what it would be. While they think preleasing efforts may mean they could start construction of Phase 2 directly after completing Phase 1, plans for covering that south facade could include a conventional wall or public art. Sara Beardsley asked if the park on top of the podium will be accessible to the public. The development team responded yes, and the design team tried to show the circulation via one of the elevators in Phase 1. John Ronan chimed in to question how anyone from the public unaffiliated with the building would know how to get up to the park. Ronan felt that it is not a truly public space and should just be restricted to the office tenants. Sara Beardsley also questioned how it would feel to be next to this large, six-story podium and how the architecture could be used to alleviate the mass. The development team spoke about how the carve outs in the base of the building work towards a human scale and the number of setback entries create some shelter as you walk around the building. Brian Lee discussed the importance of the project as a contribution to the city and that he sees it as an island that is not related to its surroundings. Lee questioned whether the amount of parking could be reduced to bring the green space closer to the public realm. Ultimately, considering a set of issues with the proposal, Lee wondered whether such a strong developer and design team could do more to elevate the level of commercial architecture in Chicago. Replying specifically to the discussion of parking, the development team said that parking is always a tradeoff where they would like people to take public transportation, bike, or walk to work. However, in a post-COVID world, the ability to drive and park at work rather than taking the train can be a significant decision for office tenants and with the direct adjacency of the Kennedy Expressway this can be a strong advantage for leasing the building. As a concession, the design team noted that the parking floors are isolated from the ramps and the floor-to-floor height is taller than usual so it would be possible to convert it to other uses in the future. With the Committee on Design review complete, the development team and DPD will review and take the comments into consideration as the project moves forward. Due to an already approved Planned Development active on the site, it is currently unclear what slate of approvals the plan will be required for the project.   ",West Loop Gate
Developers plan mixed-use development at 566 W. Van Buren,"Riverside Investment & Development in partnership with Bluestar Properties has proposed to develop a mixed-use tower at 566 W. Van Buren. Announced through Alderman Reilly’s newsletter to constituents, the new project would replace a surface parking lot and two two-story retail buildings.

John Buck proposes two-tower office project at 655 W. Madison,"The John Buck Company has revealed plans for a proposed two-tower office development at 655 W. Madison. Conceived for a full-block site along the Kennedy Expressway, the new proposal would replace an existing surface parking lot bound by W. Madison St to the north, N. Desplaines St to the east, and W. Monroe St to the south.  Designed by JGMA and HOK, the new plan would consist of a 36-story northern tower that would hold 850,000 square feet of space. Mirrored to the south, the southern tower will be slightly shorter and house just 600,000 square feet of office space. To connect the two buildings, a five-story podium will occupy the entire site footprint and will be topped with a two-acre outdoor urban park. Reported in a recent article in Crain’s, the project scope is a shift from a taller 1.5 million-square-foot tower originally planned when John Buck Company made a deal with the site’s owner back in 2019. Shifted to allow for more flexibility, John Buck indicated that construction could begin based on the pre-leasing of 150,000-200,000 square feet rather than a typical anchor tenant lease of 500,000 square feet. Tenants will have access to a secure porte cochere for arrival with over 200 parking spots provided within the project. 55,000 square feet of space will be set aside for tenant amenities as well as an outdoor park spanning an acre on top of the shared podium. The towers will have a state-of-the-art HVAC system that ensures that each floor has its own dedicated airflow, not sharing between floors.  While the project is within the site’s zoning, the project will need approval from City Council before construction could begin.

Office renovation and addition lands permits at 550 W. Randolph,"Permits have been issued for an office renovation and addition project at 550 West Randolph Street in West Loop Gate. The existing warehouse building is located at the corner of W Randolph Street and N Clinton Street. W.P. Carey is the developer in charge of the project.  With a design by Gensler, the development proposes to convert a turn-of-the-century brick and heavy timber warehouse into a bold and contemporary office building. Built in 1909, the timber-framed masonry warehouse was originally built as a central distribution center for McKesson & Robbins, a wholesale apothecary, elixir and drug distributor. The revamped and expanded six-story building will span 227,500 square feet, with large, efficient, and flexible floor plates nearing 39,500 feet each. The structure will include LEED Gold sustainable design features and tenant amenities. The proposal will reinvigorate the historic building, restoring the original façade and creating a contemporary addition with highly tailored details both inside and out. The addition will allow for the expansion of the building footprint, providing even greater open and flexible floor plates. The facade restoration will also create an engaging retail and streetscape experience. Tenant-focused amenities include a rooftop outdoor terrace and green space, a covered rooftop bar and lounge, shaded outdoor lounge areas, a ground floor lobby lounge, a fitness center with a wellness center, showers, and locker rooms, a conference meeting room space, and an indoor bike room. The salvaged heavy timber structure and metal strapping will be exposed throughout the interior, celebrating the heritage of the original warehouse. Further finishes of walnut, brass, and leather will give the building’s refined public spaces a historic resonance. Details of the interior are expected to recall the ornate and colored apothecary glassware once filled on site, while plant choices will reinforce the story of health and wellness through botanical species used in early medicine. With permits issued, general contractor Power Construction can begin work on site. Completion of the project was originally expected for the end of 2021 according to Alderman Reilly’s newsletter back in December 2020, but a new completion date has yet to be announced.

640 W. Washington gets haircut and redesign,"The mixed-use tower planned for 640 W. Washington Blvd has gotten trimmed and redesigned. Announced via Alderman Reilly’s recent newsletter to constituents, developer Crescent Heights has redesigned the project in advance of construction planning.  Originally approved by City Council in May 2021, the mixed-use tower was approved to rise 47 stories and 520 feet. The building would hold 413 residential units, 217 bicycle parking spaces, 137 car parking spaces, and provide approximately 8,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.  Changes in the new redesign include the reduction of height from 520 feet and 47 stories to 425 feet and 38 stories. This height chop removes the glassy top portion of the tower, while increasing the height of the main volume slightly. The tower massing has been widened east to west, shifting the bay spacing of the south and north elevations. At the podium, one floor was added, increasing the podium height from 46 feet to 51 feet. The parking count was also reduced from 137 to 121. Unit counts and mix will remain the same.  ﻿This change will not require any approvals from Alderman Reilly, the Committee on Zoning, or the City Council. The developer plans to begin construction later this year. ",West Loop Gate
Rendering vs. Reality: Downtown Porsche dealership opens,"Work is complete on a new Porsche dealership in the base of the Presidential Towers in West Loop Gate. Known as Porsche of Downtown Chicago, the project represents the first—and so-far only—Porsche dealership within Chicago city limits.  Developed and owned by Napleton Automotive Group, the showroom and service facility stands at the northeast corner of Jefferson and Monroe streets. The dealership occupies a commercial space that has sat vacant since the Walmart Neighborhood Market small-format grocery store closed in early 2017. Car dealerships typically represent the opposite of sound urban design, but this one is about as inoffensive as they come. It lacks a large surface lot and uses an existing curb cut and driveway for its service department. The design from RC Bowman Architecture utilizes a frameless storefront system and a minimalist (albeit on-brand) corporate facade of gray and black metal panels.  Although the dealership repurposes an existing space, the project did have to go before the city in May 2020 for a technical zoning amendment to allow additional uses, including ""indoor light equipment sales and rental” and “motor vehicle repair.""  General contractor International Contractors, Inc. started interior demolition later that year and was issued its build-out permit in January 2021.          ",West Loop Gate

Fifth City Commons begins construction at 3155 West 5th Ave,"At a ceremony held on July 26, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson led a groundbreaking ceremony for Fifth City Commons, a new affordable housing complex which will rise from a long-vacant property on Chicago's West Side. Skender, the project's general contractor, is working with Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH), which was selected in 2019 to develop the site at 3155 West 5th Ave through the C40 Reinventing Cities competition. Plans call for the construction of a new three-story building which will feature 43 one-, two, and three-bedroom rental units for East Garfield Park residents earning between 30 and 80 percent of the area median income level. “Fifth City Commons and the City of Chicago, with its commitment to and investment in sustainable affordable housing, transportation, and energy-efficiency will demonstrate the impact cities and the built environment can have on climate change,” said Mayor Johnson at the ceremony. “More than 100 years after Chicago showed the world how to design and build skyscrapers, today we are poised to lead the way in the development of sustainable affordable housing. As Mayor, and as a West Sider – I could not be more excited.” The all-electric project incorporates features such as triple pane windows and rooftop solar panels to limit energy usage. Plans also call for landscaping, EV charging, bicycle parking, and space for on-site composting. The complex will be all-electric, with sustainable features such as triple pane windows and air sealing to lower the building’s energy needs in accordance with Passive House principles. Two-thirds of all its energy needs will be supplied by rooftop solar panels. The property will also have mature landscaping, EV charging stations, extensive bicycle parking, and on-site composting.  Perkins & Will is designing Fifth City Commons alongside Nia Architects, which would provide residents with access to community rooms, a fitness room, an outdoor terrace, and three laundry rooms. “It is a privilege to work on the construction of such a sustainable development with POAH and the community,” said Skender project executive Joe Pecoraro. “We are excited to see the positive impact this building will have on the West Side.” Funding for Fifth City Commons comes from tax increment financing and HOME Investment Partnership Program assistance, sales tax returns, bonds, and low-income housing tax credits. Most of this funding was provided through the City of Chicago. ",West Side

A sign on the North Ave elevation will be removed and the terracotta behind it will be patched and repaired. Renovations will also include roof work, where crews will add a new reflective roof membrane to reduce heat gain. The second and third floors, which currently lack air conditioning, will get new ductless HVAC units. On the ground floor, exterior HVAC units on the commercial storefronts will be removed and there will be further electrical and plumbing fixture upgrades. For ADA accessibility and life safety, new elevator cabs will be installed in addition to enlarged elevator doors. A new sprinkler pump and fire alarm system will also be installed.  To meet sustainability requirements, the project will meet a 25% indoor water use reduction, is located in proximity to transit, and will install CTA digital displays. Approved by the Permit Review Committee last month, the $4.2 million rehabilitation qualifies under the Class L’s minimum investment of $2.67 million. The owner is expected to receive a total tax abatement of $4.1 million over the 12 year period of the Class L property tax incentive.  With the Commission's approval of the Class L application, the proposal heads to City Hall to get approvals.

Wicker Park condo proposal passes zoning committee,"A long-discussed plan to redevelop a vacant former used car lot near the border of Wicker Park and Humboldt Park is finally moving forward. On Tuesday the city's Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards signed off on the plan for 1317 N. Western Avenue and sent it to the full City Council for final zoning approval. The upcoming five-story development, which comes from Gibbons Construction Service and Jonathan Splitt Architects, calls for 38 two- and three-bedroom condominiums priced between $400,000 and $500,000. The ground floor will contain garage parking for 32 cars accessed via a rear alleyway and two commercial storefronts offering nearly 6,000 square feet of combined retail space.  The project won the support of local groups including the Wicker Park Committee and East Humboldt Park Neighborhood Association late last year, and Ald.

Woodlawn Central: “A model for the new Black community”,"Planned by J. Byron Brazier and his father, Apostolic Church pastor Byron Brazier, Woodlawn Central is a multiphase megadevelopment centered around the church at 63rd and Dorchester. After initially announcing the concept in December 2021, J. Byron has been working with partners Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, Gensler, AECOM, Citibank, the University of Chicago, and Preservation of Affordable Housing to move the proposal forward. Urbanize recently sat down with J. Byron to see where the project stands and how it stands out as a model for the new Black community. As a catalytic development for the South Side, J. Byron sees Woodlawn Central as the chance to show the city that the Black community has the ability to develop itself and to develop it from the inside out, and to do it without displacement. “I think we've been saddled with the idea that we don't know what we're doing. And a lot of that has to do with the lack of modern representation,” said J. Byron. “As you know, there's about 25,000 residents within the community who are predominantly Black. And the objective is to develop and put them as a priority so that they can stay. But historically, Woodlawn is known for having a 90,000-person population, so we have a lot of room to grow,” said J. Byron. While it has been over two years, the proposal has remained largely consistent. “We're still doing the two high rises, two mid-rises and promenade with the staircase that is inspired by the Spanish steps,” said J. Byron. The boutique hotel, call center, data center, residential buildings, theater, urban farming, parking, and microgrid are all still included in the plan.  With approximately 800 residential units planned, the development will offer a mix of workforce housing, artists’ housing, senior housing, affordable housing, and market-rate living. While they will not be using any LIHTC funding, the development team will meet the 30% affordability requirement applied in Woodlawn. J. Byron walked through the intent to offer both for-sale housing and rentals both to cater to capital partners, and to offer the amenities necessary to have Black Chicagoans who have moved away from Woodlawn to come back and re-enter the community. Through our conversation, it became clear that Woodlawn Central will be driven by cutting edge technology. “One of the things that traditionally developers don't do is a digital master plan. That is a part of our entire approach.” “I love the conversation about AI, AR, and VR being integrated into economic development, health, safety, education, tourism, and entertainment.” While J. Byron plans to integrate AI and other technology into the development he believes “technology is a tool and it should be used as a tool and not a solution. It should be humanity over technology, as opposed to technology over humanity.”  With sustainability in mind, the development will have its own microgrid for electricity and energy generation. “There's a company that I'm really attracted to called Bloom Energy, and they have these components where they're taking the CO2 out of the air, and they're utilizing the gas. So, we're connecting to the gas and the electric utilities, but it's actually using the CO2 to store and to regenerate that energy back into the community,” J. Byron outlined. The technology also has the opportunity to be applied to individual buildings when larger master plans are not feasible. As the project moves forward, the timeline is still in flux. “We would love to do it by 2025, but I'm not going to put that into stone, because things change. But in the process, we want to do an installation around the perimeters of some of the parking lots, which remind our community where we've been,” said J. Byron. The development will need to go through a rezoning process to amend the church’s current Planned Development to allow for the large mixed-use development, with construction expected to proceed parcel by parcel individually once approved and financed.

Committee on Design reviews Woodlawn Social,"The Committee on Design has reviewed Woodlawn Social. Chosen as the winner of the Woodlawn RFQ process back in May, the project site is a plot of vacant, city-owned land on E. 63rd St between S. Ellis Ave and S. Greenwood Ave. POAH, KMW Communities and Tandem Ventures are the developers behind the winning proposal. Designed by Koning Eizenberg and HED, the design began as a chance to make a neighborhood town square for Woodlawn featuring a new model of housing in Chicago that introduces a cross grain, breaking down the street wall and turning the residential massings to sit perpendicular to the street. This configuration creates a scale of development that maintains sunlight on the street and gives all units ample access to light and air. While looking like a series of buildings, the development only envisions two individual structures for the site. The larger building will stand six stories tall and hold 60 rental units divided up into 36 one-beds, 16 two-beds, and 8 three-beds. Its ground floor will hold 8,500 square feet of retail that faces onto a 9,000 square foot public plaza. To the west, a smaller four-story building holds 10 for-sale townhomes that will include 5 two-bed and 5 three-bedroom configurations. Residents of the buildings will have access to 10,000 square feet of outdoor space separate from the public plaza. 26 parking spaces will be lined up against the alley at the back of the building. The residential masses above the ground floor split the double-loaded corridor configuration into thinner bars that are more contextual to the smaller residential typologies of the area. The projecting and cantilevering volumes exhibit a faceted facade overlooking the plaza and use the same staggered cantilever expression at the back of the building overlooking the alley and residential neighborhood to the south.  The public plaza works to create a sense of place and community as it is large enough to be inviting and offer a space for rest while being activated by landscaping and vibrant retail space looking onto it. While not part of the scope of this project, the design team envisioned using the parcel across the street to build upon the public plaza idea and create an even larger outdoor space to help anchor this area as a community hub. Among a number of city objectives, the innovative project takes sustainability to the next level, designing in an energy and ecologically conscious way to try and achieve the Living Building Challenge. Along with a myriad of other efforts, the structure will be topped with solar panels to help with energy generation. The discussion opened with Philip Enquist, who praised the project as a great addition to the 63rd Street corridor. Asking about the south facade, Enquist clarified with the design team that the building does overhang the new alley extension at the rear of the property. Asking about the parking spaces along the alley, the design team clarified that they are studying a mix of secured, enclosed parking spaces for residents and open, easy access spaces for workers and retail patrons. Enquist’s final comments were about the focus of retail space towards the east versus the west and the design team responded that their current organization allows for the retail to orient itself more towards the nearby school, keeping the townhomes near the finer residential grain towards the south while also allowing the public plaza to align with the potential open space on the parcel to the north. Catherine Baker spoke next and commented how she loved the broken-down massing and acknowledgement of getting sun onto the southern side of the street. Baker next posed a question about how the townhomes worked, upon which the design team clarified that the townhome structure is essentially a series of two-story townhomes stacked two homes high, creating a four-story building. The bottom townhome will get a front stoop and patio facing the street as well as some outdoor space at the back, while the upper homes will get a private rooftop deck.  Andre Brumfield chimed in next and asked about how much the buildings would be overhanging the alley to the south. The design team clarified that their overhangs are within the property line and the section of alley discussed is actually a private driveway on the project site that currently does not exist and is proposed as a way to extend the alley and provide access to parking spots and loading zones. Eleanor Gorski wrapped up the commenting period by asking about the building materials and whether the team has anticipated potential alternatives in case value engineering has to happen later on down the road. The design team responded that they have discussed alternatives including doing a panelized brick system for the facade system, but ensured that while individual materials may be changed, the fundamental strategy and design intent of the currently shown materials would stay in place regardless of any potential value engineering. With input received from the committee, the development team and DPD will review and take the comments into consideration as the project moves forward. If the project seeks any zoning relief or city financing, it will need to go through the city’s formal review process before commencing construction. ",Woodlawn

DPD reveals Woodlawn RFQ designs,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has revealed the three proposals competing in the Woodlawn RFQ process. Produced by development and design teams that responded to a DPD Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in August 2022, the projects are vying for the chance to develop vacant, city-owned land on E. 63rd St between S. Ingleside Ave and S. Greenwood Ave.  According to the RFP, the land consists of Site 1 and Site 2, each of which represent unique opportunities to continue the revitalization of Woodlawn with new mixed-use buildings, leverage ongoing investments by the Obama Presidential Center, University of Chicago and other institutions, and to provide new housing and retail opportunities for Woodlawn residents. The first proposal, dubbed Woodlawn Social, comes from the developer team of POAH and KMW Communities. Set to develop Site 2, the development team includes the collaboration of architects KoningEizenberg and HED Architects on the design. Working to create community through the architecture, the design takes the traditional street block and cuts it up, turning the forms and creating spaces in between for residents and the public.

"DraftKings Sportsbook set to open next week, but without betting","The DraftKings Sportsbook under construction at Wrigley Field will open to the public next Tuesday, June 27th, albeit without sports betting as the team awaits approval from the Illinois Gaming Board. Led by Marquee Development, DraftKings, and Levy, the two-story structure is located at the corner of W. Addison St and N. Sheffield Ave, adjacent to the ballpark but not directly linked. With sports betting still awaiting approval, the team is expecting to draw customers with the massive 2,000 square foot video board that hovers above the bar and can show up to 25 sports games at once. With a two-story space, tables on the ground floor are available for walk-ins or reservations with seating options including bar seating, high-top tables, or booths. The upper floor mezzanine will hold more theater-style seating overlooking the bar and video board while also including rentable group spaces that include designated TVs that can be programmed with the groups preferred sports games.  Talking with Shawn Fawell, Project Manager for Gensler, the sportsbook has been designed so that there is truly no bad seat in the house. “Every detail was highly considered with a focus on an incredible viewing experience, from the positioning of the screens to the comfortable seating options sports fans need to settle in for a game,” Fawell said. With Wrigley Field’s standing as a National and Chicago landmark, the architecture was highly coordinated to meet the historic guidelines of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, National Park Service, and State Historic Preservation Office. The result is a contemporary structure that references the historic ballpark with its green steel elements while incorporating a substantial amount of glass to create a transparent, airy feel.  With the venue opening to customers next week, food and beverage service will include a menu of American bar fare with elevated and unique twists. Crafted by Levy, the Cubs’ hospitality partner, signature dishes will include the House Smoked Pastrami Sandwich, the Colossal Hot Dog, and a Prime Rib Sandwich. The bar service will include 10 signature selections on tap, with further wine and spirits offerings. All guests must be 21 years of age or older to enter the Sportsbook. In terms of sports betting at the venue, a DraftKings representative couldn't provide specifics on the timing of when approvals are expected, but they must go before the Illinois Gaming Board to receive the necessary permissions before sports betting could begin.  ",Wrigleyville
