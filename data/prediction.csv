Adaptive reuse begins construction at 310 N. Peoria,"Construction is kicking off on the adaptive reuse of a former warehouse building at 310 N. Peoria. Occupying the southwest corner of W. Wayman St and N. Peoria St, the building was originally designed by Adler and Sullivan and is located within the Fulton Randolph Market District. MRR 310 Peoria LLC and Fulton Market Hospitality are the developers behind the proposal. Designed by Hirsch MPG, renovation plans call for adding a setback fifth floor and repurposing the timber loft into boutique office space with a new restaurant on the first floor, second floor and basement. The hotel lobby for the adjacent approved hotel midrise will be located under an existing industrial style canopy which will also shelter diners on a large, raised exterior patio. There will be no parking spaces in the building. Approved back in 2021, it is the first phase of a larger Planned Development that will see the construction of a 14-story hotel tower with 296 hotel rooms. With permits issued for the renovation, general contractor Mint Renovations will begin work imminently.  ",Fulton Market,0.0
Hotel development at 1016 W. Lake heads to Plan Commission,"A proposed hotel development at 1016 W. Lake is heading before the Chicago Plan Commission later this month. Planned by New York-based Cogswell Realty and investor Erol Stapleton, the project is being planned for the northeast corner of W. Lake St and N. Carpenter St. The property currently includes a surface parking lot and a three-story building that will be cleared for the new development. With the values of community, sustainability, and wellness, the new hospitality concept is looking to develop a timeless and modern building that fits into the community. The project is seeking to exceed many sustainability requirements and goals including achieving WELL certification, LEED certification, and net-zero energy. The all-electric building will include solar panels on the roof as well as bird-friendly glass with bird fritting. Set to rise 220 feet, the new hotel tower will stand 15 floors high. With 143 hotel rooms planned in the building, guests will have access to a rooftop sky lounge and three floors of amenity space at the base of the building. On the ground floor, guests will enter through the hotel lobby facing N. Carpenter St and a commercial space will front W. Lake St. The building will have no parking spaces, but will offer valet service at the building’s drop off zone along N. Carpenter St. Designed by M Moser Associates, the tower will be clad in a bluestone facade with punched window openings.

1353 W. Fulton gets foundation permit,"A foundation permit has been issued for a mixed-use development 1353 W. Fulton. Planned by Shapack Partners, the development, also known under the address of 220 N. Ada, is located at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Ada St. A demolition permit was issued back in May to clear the site of the existing one-story masonry building on the property.  Rising 314 feet, the project will consist of a 29-story, mixed-use tower with 308 residential units, ground floor retail space, 115 parking spaces, and 58 bike parking spaces. The unit mix will consist of studios, one-beds, and two-beds. With a design from SOM, the building will consist of a three-story podium with a square tower portion rising above oriented along N. Ada St setback from W. Fulton St. The residential entry will front N. Ada St while retail space will span from the residential entry up to W. Fulton St. Amenity space will top the podium and occupy the top floor of the tower. Balconies will dot the facade in a seemingly random pattern that aligns with unit types. The podium will be expressed as two separate massings. The portion under the tower is expressed with a similar materiality and gridding as the tower above. To the north of the tower, the podium at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Ada St is expressed as a solid volume with brick detailing that creates porosity and creates a play of light and shadow as the sun moves.  The project will meet sustainability goals by achieving a Green Globes 2-Globes certification, installing two EV charging stations, preparing 23 parking spots for EV charging readiness, installing a CTA digital display, and ensuring 80% construction waste diversion.  To meet affordability requirements, the developers will provide 20% of the units as affordable housing on-site at a weighted average of 60% AMI. With the foundation permit in hand, general contractor Clayco Inc can begin construction on the building’s caissons. A full building permit has yet to be filed for the $135 million tower.

919 W. Fulton celebrates groundbreaking,"Developers Fulton Street Companies and JDL Development yesterday celebrated the groundbreaking of 919 W. Fulton. Situated in Fulton Market, the project marks Chicago’s first major new office development to commence construction in over a year. “Today’s groundbreaking event is a win for Chicago,” said Alex Najem, Founder and CEO of Fulton Street Companies. “We have assembled the very best organizations and companies, led by exceptional people, to remind the world that we can – and will – continue to build in downtown Chicago. Shanna Khan is the definition of exceptional people, and 919 W Fulton would not be possible if not for her belief in the project, her vision as the chief design officer and commitment as the lead equity investor with SNK Capital. As such, Fulton Street is grateful for Shanna, the leadership of Alderman and Vice Mayor Burnett, our tenants and all of our partners for making this ambitious and remarkable development a reality for our great city.” The 400,000 square foot mixed-use building is set to become home to the headquarters of Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, who will occupy 112,000 square feet of space in the 11-story building. On the ground floor, Gibsons Restaurant Group will occupy 15,500 square feet of the planned retail space. 65 car parking spaces will be included in an underground parking level. Designed by Morris Adjmi Architects and FitzGerald, the 11-story building features a facade that was designed to fit into the historic context and exhibits a series of notches and setbacks as it rises to reduce its visual impact on the historic Fulton-Randolph Market District that it will sit within. Originally planned to connect to the residential building at 910 W. Lake and convert it into more office space, the revised scope of the project will leave the existing building as apartments due to the stronger demand for residential.  The project pays great attention to air quality, material selection, energy efficiency, wellness and environmental impact, and is pursuing WELL and LEED Silver certifications. With two lobbies—one on Sangamon and one corridor connecting access between Fulton and Lake streets—the address of the finished building will be 217 N Sangamon. Financial backing for the project was secured through strategic partnerships with Bank OZK and Manulife Investment Management. SNK Capital assumed the pivotal role as the lead equity investment partner. With Skender serving as general contractor, the construction is expected to be completed in 2025. ",Fulton Market,0.0

Urbanize tours penthouses at The Row Fulton Market,"Urbanize returned to The Row Fulton Market to see the upper residences and penthouses at the top of the building. Overlooking Fulton Market and the surrounding city, the building at 164 N. Peoria was developed by Related Midwest with the design coming from Morris Adjmi Architects.  Starting on the 33rd floor, the Tier 3 model unit was a 3-bedroom, 2.5-bath layout measuring 1,650 square feet. Priced at a range of $6,495-$7,465 per month, the particular layout we viewed featured a southeastern view from the large living space and kitchen. One of the bedrooms was staged to show how residents could use it as a private home office in an era of working from home. Heading up to the 42nd floor, the first penthouse we toured measured almost 2,400 square feet with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths. The large living space and kitchen faces northeast, giving sweeping views of downtown and the lakefront going north, while the east-facing primary suite also features expansive views of downtown. 12-foot ceilings, motorized window shades, and heated floors in the primary suite bathroom are just a few of the luxury features in the penthouse that is listed for $15,250 per month. Our final stop was a 43rd floor penthouse featuring a northwest exposure in the main living space with bedrooms facing west. With 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, the almost 2,400 square foot layout would rent for $16,250 per month. While sharing many of the luxury features of the other penthouse, this configuration includes a 430-square-foot outdoor terrace that wraps around the northwest corner to give views west and north from the building. In our previous tour at the end of June, we saw the building’s amenity spaces which are on the sixth floor. Residents will have access to the Gather Room and connecting Study, which offer a range of seating configurations and workspace options ranging from booths to library tables to private conference rooms oriented around a three-sided fireplace; the Athletic Club, a fully equipped fitness center with adjacent Wellness Studio and two separate terraces for open-air workouts; the Playhouse, a colorful, interactive play area for children outfitted with toys, games and spaces for playdates and parties; and the Social Club, a reservable entertainment suite with adjacent terrace.  Outside, the 13,800-square-foot landscaped deck wraps the tower on three sides, featuring the west-facing lap pool with lounge seating; the three outdoor grilling kitchens tucked under pergolas and separated by high planters; the lounging hammocks; and the two fire pits overlooking the surrounding cityscape.

Guinness Open Gate Brewery celebrates ribbon cutting,"Guinness recently celebrated the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Guinness Open Gate Brewery in Fulton Market. Located at 901 W. Kinzie, the former rail depot consists of a brewery, taproom, restaurant, and bakery housed in a 15,000-square-foot newly transformed space. This site will combine more than 260 years of brewing experience from Ireland, with cutting edge American brewing innovation, for a uniquely Chicago experience.  “This is an exciting step in the continuing evolution of the Guinness brand in America. It’s been a long journey, but we are so thrilled to be opening our doors this week and to contribute to Chicago’s world class food and beer scene,” said Rodney Williams, President of Diageo Beer Company. “As a Chicago native, I can confidently share that we aim to celebrate and showcase this great city and make a positive impact in the community, all while serving great beer.” Designed by Whitney Architects and Studio K Creative, the design of the building marries new and old, transforming a long vacant building into a state of-the-art facility, with a front patio with stairs reminiscent of Chicago’s Riverwalk steps, and a contemporary door with weathered steel finish. The space features a hand painted mural, complemented by a bubbly amber sculptural light fixture – a nod to the iconic foam atop a fresh pint of Guinness – which flows throughout the brewery. A nearly 10,000-pound harp sculpture with layered ambient lighting sits high above the main taproom bar.  Guests can expect 12-16 rotating experimental draughts, most of which will be brewed on site and exclusively available in the taproom, alongside signatures like Guinness Draught Stout, Guinness Extra Stout, and Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, which will always come straight from Dublin.

Two-tower residential development planned at 400 N. Elizabeth,"A rezoning application has been filed for a two-tower residential development at 400 N. Elizabeth. Fronting N. Elizabeth St, the irregularly shaped lot is bound by W. Ogden Ave to the west, N. Elizabeth St to the east, and Metra rail tracks to the north and south. Developer Mark Goodman & Associates who owns the site is teaming up with Weldon Development Group for the project. Designed by Archeo Design Studio, the new development proposal will include two residential towers totaling 724 apartments, with 145 (20%) of them set aside as affordable. Designed as two rectangular point towers, the towers will have gridded facades made up of metal panel and glazing. The parking floors will have a hybrid of architectural mesh and open-air glazing. On the eastern half of the site, the phase one tower will reach 395 feet tall with 384 residential units and 384 bike parking spaces. On the western half of the property, the second phase tower will reach 375 feet in height with 340 units and 340 bike parking spaces. Between the two buildings, residents will have access to a total of 348 parking spaces. On the ground floor, both residential lobbies will face east towards N. Elizabeth St. An access drive will stretch across the north side of the site for loading and parking access including a drop-off zone. Designed by Confluence, the southern portion of the site will have a pedestrian plaza that will include a pedestrian path connecting N. Elizabeth St and N. Ogden Ave. The proposal comes after developer Mark Goodman & Associates received approval for a 16-story life sciences office building back in November 2021. That building, designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, would have had approximately 503,000 square feet of lab and office space. Now partnering with Weldon Development Group, the new proposal is seeking to rezone the site to DX-7 before reinstituting the Planned Development. A 4.5 FAR bonus would increase the allowable FAR to 11.5. With the rezoning application submitted to the city, the development will undergo a full review and approval process, requiring approvals from Alderman Burnett, the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and full City Council.

Trammell Crow signs lease expansion with Belay Diagnostics,"Trammell Crow Company has announced that Belay Diagnostics has expanded its footprint at Fulton Labs only a few short months after signing a lease in August 2023. The company, which uses a proprietary molecular testing platform to revolutionize how brain and spinal cord cancers are detected, signed a deal for an additional 6,100 square feet of space at 1375 West Fulton, bringing its footprint at the life science building to just over 10,000 square feet. Belay will now occupy 5,750 square feet of expansion space on the ninth floor of the building, 420 square feet on the fifth floor, as well as the 4,000-square-foot science-ready lab suite that the company already occupies. Driven by positive fundraising efforts and clinical trial results, the company is rapidly growing, with plans to utilize its expanded space to advance its work on a proprietary molecular testing technology for brain and spinal cord cancers. “We are incredibly pleased that Belay has expanded their footprint within 1375 West Fulton,” said Morgan Baer-Blaska of TCC. “This expansion is a testament to the life science ecosystem that we are working to create across not only our Fulton Labs campus, but our entire life science portfolio in Chicago. The science-ready lab suites at 1375 were designed to be key contributors in the growth of their users, allowing companies to focus exclusively on their work, which ultimately results in a need for more space to accommodate the scale of each business. TCC’s expansive Fulton Labs campus, which also includes 400 N Aberdeen, stands at the ready to accommodate this growth that many tenants are experiencing; Belay’s recent expansion is a perfect example of this.” ""Fulton Labs and Trammell Crow offer not only world class space but a genuine partnership for emerging companies. It is uncommon to say you have a relationship with your landlord, but in this case, it is an honest assessment,"" shared Brian Coe, CEO of Belay Diagnostics. 1375 West Fulton is part of TCC's 725,000-square-foot Fulton Labs campus in Chicago, which includes nearby 400 North Aberdeen. Additionally, TCC’s Chicagoland lab portfolio includes Evanston Labs and Hyde Park Labs, both of which are set to deliver in 2024. ",West Loop,0.0
Developer pivots from condos to bathhouse at 1010 W. Madison,"Developer Fulton Street Cos. has scrapped plans for a 10-story condominium development in favor of a two-story bathhouse. Located at the northwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Morgan St, the 17,000-square-foot site is currently a surface parking lot. Designed by Gensler, the new scheme envisions a 40,000 square foot, two-story spa set to be occupied by New York-based Bathhouse. The building is set to include a rooftop restaurant and pool. Renderings show a concrete structure with arched bays filled in with opaque glazing. The scheme is a distinct shift from the ten-story condo building, a sign of the struggling condo market in the city. If it had been built, the condo building would have had 25 homes, priced from $2 million to $6 million. With the build-to-suit-lease planned with Bathhouse, construction could begin as soon as the beginning of 2024 with opening targeted for Spring 2025. ",West Loop,0.0
PRC approves adaptive reuse at 801 W. Madison,"The Permit Review Committee has approved plans for the adaptive reuse of the former Mid-City Trust & Savings Bank Building. Located at 801 W. Madison, the building occupies the southwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Halsted St. Purchased in 2022, ECG Madison LLC is leading the redevelopment of the building. With Pappageorge Haymes Partners serving as the architect, the project will rehabilitate the exterior and convert the interior into a hotel with commercial space on the ground floor. The landmark building’s significant features are designated as all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as the interior entrance lobby of the main banking hall, including skylights, original check desks and counters, and historic lighting. On the exterior, the rehabilitation will clean, repair, and repaint the historic bronze windows on the first and second floors. Non-historic windows on the third through sixth floors will be repaired and replaced if they are beyond repair. A new entrance canopy along W. Madison St will be added for the hotel entrance and exterior uplighting will be installed on the building’s facade. A mural is proposed for a portion of the common brick on the west elevation, with historic preservation staff recommending the use of vapor permeable paint or attaching mural panels onto the masonry to prevent damage to the brick facade. On the interior, the rehab will retain historic features of the banking hall. The hotel’s main entrance will be at the northwest end of the building’s W. Madison St frontage, with the main entry to ground floor space at the northeast corner. A new passenger and service elevator will be added. A glass partition between interior columns will enclose the monumental stair for the hotel space to separate it from the rest of the ground floor banking hall space.  The elevator lobby and main corridors of the upper floors will be retained, and the existing door locations will be used for the hotel rooms wherever possible. The historic skylight will be modified and renovated to add a new daylighting system over the exterior skylight structure and a new translucent acoustical panel system will be added on the interior that will have the appearance of glazing.  With approval from the PRC, the redevelopment plan can move forward permitting and construction. A timeline for completion is currently unknown.  ",West Loop,1.0
Height and parking cited as issues for 420 N. May,"Developer Crescent Heights presented their revised design for 420 N. May to the local community, receiving heavy pushback on the proposed height and parking concerns. Located at the western end of the West Loop, the project site is bound by the Metra tacks to the north, N. May St to the east, W. Kinzie St to the south, and N. Racine Ave to the west.   Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the 53-story skyscraper would top out at 615 feet and include 587 residential units with just 3,100 square feet of retail space. To meet affordable requirements, 118 of the units, or 20%, will be set aside as affordable.  The tower’s design combines a vertical point tower that features faceted glazing with a stepped portion connected by an inset reveal between the two sections. At the base, the six-story podium is broken down with setbacks to maintain a relationship with the surrounding neighborhood context. At the southeastern corner of the site, an existing masonry brick building will be maintained and stained to integrate it into a cohesive podium expression. On the interior, the podium has been designed to activate all street-facing elevations. On the ground floor, the residential entry and common space will sit underneath the residential point tower, while leasing offices and retail space will face W. Kinzie St. A coworking amenity space and bike parking will face N. May St. On the upper floors of the podium, residential units will screen the parking spaces before the amenity deck tops off the podium. The existing water tower will also be retained in the new design. With parking a top concern, the developer already increased the parking count from 339 to 440 spaces. The developer said that they have seen an increased demand for parking at their other residential properties, so the increase of 101 spaces is in line with that increased demand and will help relieve pressure on nearby street parking. The extra parking spaces will be accommodated in a level of parking underground to avoid impacting the scale of the podium. Despite this increase, neighbors continued their calls for more parking and cited concerns over traffic in the neighborhood.   Another major concern for neighbors was the height of the building, citing concerns of the shadows it will cast on the buildings to the north of it and that it was “excessive” for the neighborhood. While the architects responded that this design was in line with architectural and urban design standards and direction from DPD, Alderman Burnett asked the developer to take a look at the height of the building, commenting that he doesn’t always agree with planning. As it stands, the developer is looking to rezone the site from M2-3 to DX-5 and get a FAR bonus of 3.1 by paying over $5 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. The Planned Development designation and rezoning needs approval from Alderman Burnett before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council can review and approve it. The projected $300 million development will need to receive its necessary approvals before looking to secure financing in these difficult financial times. The developer commented that the project is at least a year out from breaking ground if approvals and funding fall into place. The construction timeline would then take 26-30 months. ",West Loop,1.0
Belay Diagnostics signs lease at Trammell Crow’s Fulton Labs,"Trammell Crow Company signed a lease with Belay Diagnostics at 1375 West Fulton, where the company will lease a 4,000-square-foot science-ready lab suite. The company, which uses a proprietary molecular testing platform, licensed from Johns Hopkins, to revolutionize how brain and spinal cord cancers are detected, will move into the fifth-floor space in September. “The leasing momentum we have seen at our Fulton Labs campus this year is not only a testament to the world-class product we have developed, but to the evolution and continued growth of Chicago as hub for life science innovation,” said Morgan Baer-Blaska of TCC’s Chicago team. “We are excited that Belay Diagnostics chose Chicago and the science-ready lab suites at 1375 West Fulton as their homebase to conduct incredibly important and life-saving research.

Zoning application filed for 420 N. May,"A zoning application has been filed for Crescent Heights’ proposal for a 615-foot-tall tower at 420 N. May. Located at the western end of the West Loop, the project site is placed between the two sets of Metra tracks, bound by N. May St, W. Kinzie St, and N. Racine Ave.   Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the tower is planned as a focal point for the highly visible site, creating a gateway to the West Loop with an iconic design. The dynamic massing reflects the convergence of surrounding neighborhoods and extends the life and activity of the street vertically up the facade. An existing masonry building will be preserved and incorporated into the design, while a pedestrian corridor will be made where Ann St. used to run through the property. Rising 53 floors, the tower’s design began as an extrusion. That volume was stepped to the west and distinguished with a reveal and facets in the vertical massing. The design was completed by adding a crown and making the facade contextual. The bulk of the building sits to the west side of the site, with a lower six-story podium occupying most of the property towards the east.  At the ground floor, the first residential lobby will sit at the base of the tower, facing a pedestrian plaza at the northeast corner of W. Kinzie St and N. Racine Ave. Along W. Kinzie St, the building will hold 3,100 square feet of retail, a second residential entry, 2,700 square feet of coworking amenity, and a bike amenity space. Totaling 587 units, the building’s apartments will be a mix of micro, studio, one-beds, one-bed plus dens, two-beds, and three-beds. To meet affordable requirements, 118 units will be designated as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. Within the podium, 440 parking spaces (up from 339) will be wrapped with residential units facing the street frontages. 587 bike parking spaces will also be provided.  With the official zoning application submitted, the developers are moving forward with plans to rezone the site from M2-3 to DX-5 with a Planned Development designation that includes the use of a 3.1 FAR bonus. As the proposal progresses, it will need to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council for full approval.  ",West Loop,1.0
Fulton Labs scores another new tenant,"Trammell Crow Company has signed another lease at Fulton Labs. Located at 1375 W. Fulton, the newest tenant is Charles River Laboratories, who will occupy 8,800 square feet of space on the seventh floor. “Watching Fulton Labs come to life over the last few years has been an incredible journey for TCC and our project partners. The state-of-the-art campus is attracting users in the life sciences space that are seeking high-quality lab and office space that affords them an opportunity to grow in Chicago. We are energized to see the continued interest in the Fulton Labs properties, as well as the heightened interest in Chicago as a top-tier life sciences market,” said Morgan Baer-Blaska, Vice President with TCC. “We look forward to welcoming CRL into their new space at Fulton Labs later this year.”  CRL’s CRADL business already occupies 10,000 square feet on the ground floor at 1375 West Fulton. The campus was designed to meet the needs of the growing companies like CRL, which will use their expansion space to accelerate and augment their own clients’ discovery efforts. Trammell Crow has landed multiple other new tenants recently for the building, including the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago and Dimension Inx. Other tenants include Celadyne Technologies, Portal Innovations, Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Vanqua Bio and Talis Biomedical. ",West Loop,0.0
1101 W. Van Buren lands full building permit,"A full building permit has been issued for the mixed-use development at 1101 W. Van Buren. Sitting at the south end of S. Aberdeen St before the Eisenhower Expressway, the project is planned by Pizzuti Development. After being approved all the way back in 2015, the site has sat empty and the Planned Development designation almost expired until the developer received an extension from the Department of Planning and Development.  With Goettsch Partners on board for the revised design, the tower will rise 21 floors, down from 26 stories. While the height has been reduced from 274 feet down to 226 feet, the 298 apartments will be retained. The project will also reduce the previously approved 140 car parking spaces down to 82 parking spaces. With STL Architects previously in charge of the design, their plan called for a large rectangular volume that was adorned with modules of windows in different sizes. A large “frame” element was introduced at the amenity level as a feature piece of the design. The new design switches out the metal, gridded facade for one that is clad in glass and steel. Stretching out horizontally, the volume is broken up with a series of insets that stagger up the facade.  At the ground floor, the glass has been recessed to reveal brick-clad columns across the entire W. Van Buren St frontage. Residents will enter the building through the residential entry located at the middle of the building’s street frontage. Retail space will occupy the northeast corner, with coworking, a game room, and bike parking on the west end of the ground floor. Parking access will be from a private driveway on the eastern side of the property.   With all permits now issued, Power Construction can continue construction all the way through completion. The building is set to be completed in late 2024.  ",West Loop,0.0
City Council approves 1016 W. Jackson ,"The Chicago City Council has approved a proposed mixed-use development at 1016 W. Jackson. Located just west of the intersection of W. Jackson Blvd and S. Morgan St, the new tower would replace an existing five-story shared office building that includes a large parking lot. While currently nothing is proposed for it, the zoning application includes a second site just across the alley facing onto W. Adams St. Planned by Mavrek Development, the new mixed-use building will stand 28 floors tall, rising 295 feet to its parapet. As a mixed-use project, the tower will hold 370 residential units with a mix of 40% studios, 40% one-beds, and 20% two-beds. The ground floor will offer approximately 4,500 square feet of retail space fronting W. Jackson Blvd, along with the residential lobby and a bike room with 350 spaces for residents. With BKV Group in charge of the design, the building meets the ground with a three-story podium that has been setback to create a wider sidewalk along W. Jackson Blvd. The ground floor sets back further to create an arcade and inviting space for the residential entry which is tucked around the side behind the retail space fronting W. Jackson Blvd. Site Design Group has been tapped to design this pedestrian-friendly paseo with lighting, bike racks, outdoor furniture, and benches. Above the ground floor, the second and third floors of the podium will hold parking for 125 cars and will be screened from the exterior in a combination of metal paneling and translucent glass. The roof of the podium will be activated with an outdoor amenity deck for the residents which will include an outdoor pool. The tower portion of the building, rising above the podium, will be set back from the street with a T-shaped footprint and inset balconies. To create variety and interest, the tower will be clad in a combination of glass and rust-colored metal paneling composed in a way that contrasts portions of the building on each elevation.  To meet the ARO requirements, the developers have elected to provide all of the required 74 affordable units within the building at an average of 60% AMI. The project will meet sustainability requirements by achieving a Green Globes 2-Globes certification, implementing green roofs, providing EV charging stations, and ensuring construction waste diversion. With all approvals secured, the site will be rezoned from DS-3 to DX-5 with an overall Planned Development designation to head to the Committee on Zoning and then the full City Council. To receive a 3.1 FAR bonus, the developers will pay $1.85 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.  Since the current office building on the site has active businesses in the building, the site won’t be cleared until full approvals and funding is secured. With all city approvals secured, the developers expect to break ground on the $100 million by the end of 2023 and deliver the new building in Spring 2025. ",West Loop,1.0
Urbanize tours 150 N. Ashland,"Urbanize toured the recently topped out structure of 150 N. Ashland. Planned by Marquette Companies, the structure stands at the intersection of N. Ashland Ave and W. Lake St, where the Women’s Treatment Center used to stand. Designed by Brininstool + Lynch, the new 12-story building will connect to the adjacent 1920s building at the south end of the site. Rising 154 feet tall, the development will hold 210 dwelling units, with ground floor retail and amenity space. Walking with representatives from Marquette Companies and Power Construction, we began the tour by heading up to the 12th floor, which will house an amenity space as well as an east-facing outdoor deck. The interior amenity space was being prepped for a final concrete pour, with the rest of the rooftop planned for future mechanical units. Views from the deck overlook Union Park towards the West Loop and downtown beyond. Heading down the building, we stopped on the ninth floor where the very first mechanicals are being installed and the building is still open to the exterior. Units facing Union Park will have balconies protruding from the facade. Stopping next on the 6th floor, facade construction has begun with the installation of cold-form metal framing. The building exterior will be clad in fiber cement paneling hung on the cold-form metal framing with insulation in between. The third floor of the building has insulation attached on the exterior and is awaiting the fiber cement paneling. As part of the development, the adjacent 1920s structure is being renovated and incorporated into the building. Crews framed out a structural link and blew through the old building’s wall to connect the new structure to the old one. Due to uneven floor heights, the 5th floor will have ramps down into the historic building. Further down in the building, the second floor is the first level to have interior framing installed with drywall stacked and ready to be installed. On the ground floor, the historic building will hold residential amenities including an outdoor deck carved from an old mechanical area that will feature grilling stations. The ground floor of the new building will hold 27 parking spaces with the residential lobby and coworking spaces fronting N. Ashland Ave at a slightly lower elevation. The retail space will hold the corner at W. Lake St and N. Ashland Ave, with the remaining 26 parking spaces located on the basement level. With the building structure topped out, Power Construction plans to remove the tower crane in a few weeks and have the exterior enclosed by the summer. Turnover of units to ownership will occur in Q3 and Q4 this year, with pre-leasing set to begin late summer. Move-ins are expected to begin in November.  ",West Loop,1.0
Sterling Bay revises plan for 1300 W. Carroll,"Sterling Bay has presented its revised plans for 1300 W. Carroll. Located at the northwestern corner of Fulton Market, the large site is bound by N. Elizabeth St to the east, W. Carroll Ave to the south, N. Ada St to the west, and the Metra tracks to the north. Originally revealed in Fall 2021, Sterling Bay has been going through the review process with DPD since then to get to the current version of the project. With SOM in charge of the design, the scheme still includes two towers that are mixed-use with retail, office space, and residential units. Originally designed with a bar typology, the towers have been redesigned as point towers separated across the site as far as possible. Designing more slender towers allows for them to have a skyline presence of points rather than walls.   Focusing on Phase 1, the revised tower will stand 515 feet tall with 40 floors. Planned to be mixed-use, the first four floors will have ground floor retail space and office space along the south frontage with parking behind. With a total of 259 spaces, there will be one floor of parking placed underground to mitigate the height of the podium. With an amenity level and outdoor deck on the fifth floor, full office floors continue above on the sixth through ninth floors. The 10th floor will hold more amenities before the building switches to a vertical tower on floors 12 through 38 which will hold 361 residential units.  Inspired by the former ADM Flour Mill, elements from the historic structure have been interpreted in contemporary ways. The office portion is designed with a concrete expression and fronts W. Carroll Ave with rounded bay windows that are reminiscent of the silos. Along N. Elizabeth St, the bay windows give way to an X-ray expression of the structural system showing the columns and their capitals. Every office floor will get an inset terrace that breaks down the podium’s scale, with the residential entry located on the northern end of the Elizabeth St frontage. The residential tower above will be clad in metal and glass topped by a silo-like crown that creates a recognizable feature on the skyline. Working with Omni Ecosystems, the first phase will see the construction of a new pocket park across N. Elizabeth St to the east. The green space will be linked to the development with newly widened sidewalks that will be uninterrupted since all of the curb cuts have been consolidated into one access point for parking and loading off of N. Ada St. The north terminus of N. Elizabeth St has been pulled back to expand the pocket park with a provision for a potential future Metra stop connection along the tracks. While the second phase was not presented in detail, the building has been pushed to the southwest corner of the site and will also be a point tower set to rise 418 feet. Shaped for daylighting, the second phase will also include a heavily expanded plaza midblock along W. Carroll Ave. Paired with Phase 1, the buildings will produce a total of 741 units (down from an original 971) and have a combined FAR of 10. The development will be paying $4.27 into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to receive an FAR bonus and the residential buildings will include 20% affordable units, producing 72 units in Phase 1.   While a date for a Plan Commission hearing has not been set, Sterling Bay hopes to begin construction on Phase 1 by Q4 2023 and would take two years to build. Phase 2 would then begin construction within a year of completing Phase 1. ",West Loop,1.0

Urbanize tours construction progress at Embry,"Urbanize recently toured Embry, a new 16-story residential tower at 21 N. May. Planned by Sulo Development, the project will bring 58 luxury condominiums to the area. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the 201-foot-tall structure will be clad in an Art Deco-inspired facade with floor-to-ceiling windows and a bronzed aluminum finish.  Starting at the top, the 15th floor will be home to the two penthouse units offered in the building. With taller 11-foot windows, the homes will have extensive access to the outdoors with large outdoor terraces measuring 2,200 square feet each with their own private swimming pools. Stopping one floor down, the 14th floor is the highest typical floor plate, with four condos that will each have direct to unit access from the elevator. To give west-facing homes a downtown view, the building steps out at the north and south ends to give the units an east-facing view corridor.  Heading down the building, our next stop was the 5th floor where crews are installing the facade. Designed as a window wall system, the facade has an Art Deco-inspired profile that reacts to the sun as it moves throughout the day. Due to its more complex nature, the window wall system takes crews two weeks to complete one floor.  Stopping down a level on the fourth floor, the building is fully enclosed on this level and mechanicals are being installed. With a post-tensioned concrete structure, the floor plates have very few columns, allowing for better unit layouts. Materials for interior framing have been staged and are awaiting installation.  Our next stop was the third floor, which has the top level of the duplexes overlooking N. May St. With living spaces on the third floor, each unit has its bedrooms on the second floor. Framing was just beginning on the third floor, while the second floor is close to fully framed. With amenities occupying the eastern part of the second floor, residents will have access to a chef’s kitchen and lounge, tenant storage, and fitness center. A southern terrace will offer residents fire pits and grilling stations, while the northern terrace will have a dog run and putting green. Heading down further, we stopped briefly in the basement which will house underground parking. To meet market demands without having a large podium, the building was designed with one level of underground parking in addition to ground floor parking. Offering 78 spaces, the ground floor’s facade has been designed to screen the parking behind it.  With the tower topping out back in mid-January, window installation is ongoing and set to finish in the second quarter of this year. With McHugh Construction leading the construction, a full turnover to the development team is planned for Q4 2023. ",West Loop,0.0

Specific features will include roll-in showers, pull-under sinks, accessible appliances, lower switches/outlets, windows and door handles. The building will also incorporate a variety of common space and market rate amenities. The approximately $52 million development will be funded with $5.8 million in Multi-Family Program Funds, $19 million in IHDA multifamily housing revenue bonds, $1 million from an IHDA senior loan, a $13 million loan from BMO Bank, $7.2 million from the IHDA Trust Fund, $5 million in a seller loan, $11 million in LIHTC equity, and $600,000 from OTR.

With Pappageorge Haymes Partners serving as the architect, permit filings indicate the development will be 12 stories tall with 110 residential units. The ground floor will have commercial space and the building will provide 81 parking spaces on the first and second floors. With the site zoned DX-5, the mixed-use development is likely proceeding as-of right, avoiding a review by City Hall and associated committees including the Chicago Plan Commission and Committee on Zoning. Renderings or drawings have not been made public at the time of writing. Developer CMK Companies is keeping busy in the area, with permits issued or in the works for developments at 1630 S. Wabash, 1700 S. Wabash, and 1723 S. Michigan. This permit issuance will allow general contractor Brandts Build, LLC to begin construction and install the foundation piles for the building. Further permits for the full foundation and superstructure as well as the full building permit have been filed and are awaiting issuance. ",South Loop,0.0

PRC approves development at 2348 S. Indiana,"The Permit Review Committee has approved plans for an optical signal processing plant at 2348 S. Indiana. Located at the southwest corner of S. Indiana Ave and E. 24th St, the project site stretches all the way to S. Michigan Ave. Planned by Lumen Technologies, the project will carve out a new 20-foot north/south alley and the parcel facing S. Michigan Ave will be sold.  Designed by EXP, the processing plant will occupy a new two-story building, topping out at 58 feet. The building’s massing retains the historic street wall and uses a consistent scale and massing within the historic district. The facade is broken down into a series of storefront bays, with a secondary wall inset three feet behind the glass on the ground floor that will be activated with informational displays and graphics. The second-floor glazing will be opaque spandrel glass. Precast concrete panels will be faced with brick veneer to create the appearance of brick construction, with decorative frames and inset brick surrounding the storefronts.  On the interior, the ground floor will have mechanical spaces surrounding the gateway floor. An exterior yard for loading and proposed generators will be accessed from the new alley. The second floor will be mostly empty space to allow for future expansion.  With approval from the Permit Review Committee, the $72.5 million development can move forward with permitting and construction. A timeline for completion is currently unknown. ",South Loop,0.0
Full building permit issued for 1700 S. Wabash,"A full building permit has been issued for a residential development at 1700 S. Wabash. Located across from Fred Anderson Park, the 48-foot-wide site is just north of the CTA Substation at 1714 S. Wabash. The subject property is currently vacant and has no alley access due to the CTA tracks behind the parcel. Developed by CMK Companies, the new residential building will rise 9 floors and host 37 apartments. The unit mix will consist of 11 studios, 10 one-beds, 14 two-beds, and two three-bedroom units on the top floor. 4 parking spaces will be provided inside the ground floor towards the back of the building. Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the ground floor will occupy the full site, with the residential entry and garage entry both facing S. Wabash Ave. Starting on the second floor, the residential tower sets back from the south and west property lines and gives second floor units outdoor terraces. Clad in a glass and metal window wall system, the tower massing continues up vertically until the ninth floor, where the building steps in from the east and west sides to create terraces for the two three-bedroom units. The tower will top out at 115 feet with mechanical screens blocking the mechanical units from view. The project received a series of variances from the Zoning Board of Appeals in July. The first approval was for a special use to establish a residential use below the second floor. The first variation was to reduce the rear setback from the required 30' to 15'. The second variation allowed for the alternative compliance with the open space requirements for the project. Due to the constrained lot size and dimensions, the third variation allowed for the reduction of off-street parking spaces from the required thirty-seven to four. The final variation was to permit a proposed 14' wide driveway to access the development despite its location on a pedestrian street due to the lack of alley access. After receiving permits for the building’s foundation piles and superstructure, this latest permit will allow general contractor Brandts Build LLC to continue construction through completion.

Lendlease completes first condo closings at The Reed,"Lendlease announced today it has begun closings for the condominiums at The Reed at Southbank, the 41-story residential tower at 234 W. Polk in Chicago’s South Loop. As the second building in the developer’s Southbank master plan along the Chicago River, The Reed is a hybrid residential building offering both rental and for-sale options.  “As one of the first residential towers developed directly on the Chicago River south of Madison Street, The Reed is a rare offering that allows residents to live – and own – along the river in the heart of downtown, with a 2-acre park as their backyard,” said Jon Cordell, director of development, management and operations, for the central region at Lendlease.  Perkins&Will is designing the Reed, which draws from the industrial character of Printer’s Row with a sleek dark exterior which translates into the interior design of the building. Homes feature nine-foot custom concrete ceilings and metal accents enhanced with luxury features such as floor-to-ceiling windows and six-inch wide-plank hardwood flooring. Kitchens include Bosch appliances, quartz countertops, a porcelain backsplash, and large islands with architectural steel legs. Baths feature custom-designed vanities and Kohler and Hansgrohe fixtures. Buyers can choose from three different finish packages. Some residences feature balconies overlooking the Chicago River and cityscape. For-sale homes, located on floors 23 through 41, comprise 216 of The Reed’s 440 total residences. Ranging from 630 to 1,660 square feet, condos include one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans priced from the low $400,000s to $1.4 million. Condominium owners have exclusive access to a dedicated suite of amenities located on the second floor, including a fireplace lounge, show kitchen and flexible workspaces. A covered outdoor terrace on the building’s northwest corner overlooks the adjacent river and Southbank Park, the publicly accessible green space at the center of the Southbank master plan that features its own riverwalk section linking Harrison and Polk streets. Condo residents will also have access to amenities on the eighth floor shared with renters, featuring a 15,000-square-foot outdoor amenity deck with a resort-style pool and cabanas, a sunning lawn and fire pits. Addressing heightened interest in outdoor entertaining, the deck also includes fully equipped kitchens and dining areas. The amenities continue indoors with an expansive fitness center connected to the outdoor exercise terrace, with dedicated HIIT and yoga spaces, and cardio and strength training equipment. Other offerings include a wet lounge, show kitchen and dining room; lounge room with TVs, billiards table and seating areas that can double as workspaces; virtual sports simulation room; salon; massage and media rooms. “We have found the hybrid model, offering both for-sale and rental homes, works very well for a variety of reasons, including the ability to offer a wider range of amenities that are simply much better than typical condominium buildings, without excessive monthly assessments,” according to Jon Cordell, director of development, management and operations, for the central region at Lendlease. ”In most condominium buildings, the scale and variety of amenities that are available at The Reed would price out many buyers who would otherwise have to pay much higher assessments.” The Reed is built to achieve LEED Gold, Fitwel and ENERGY STAR certifications. Lendlease, which plans to reach absolute zero carbon by 2040 used a propriety low embodied carbon concrete in the construction of The Reed. The development also continues Lendlease’s partnership with The Roof Crop, installing and maintaining rooftop flower beds, U-Pick gardens and beehives from which honey will be harvested for use by residents and local businesses. Prospective buyers can tour three furnished models at The Reed by appointment. For more information, call (312) 260-9797 or visit www.thereedsouthbank.com. ",South Loop,0.0

Crescent Heights lists NEMA Phase 2 site for sale,"Miami-based developer Crescent Heights has listed the vacant site at 1201 S. Michigan in the South Loop. Measuring 43,123 square feet, the property is at the southeast corner of W. Roosevelt Rd and S. Michigan Ave overlooking Grant Park. According to Crain’s, the developers have hired CBRE to market the property. Sited directly adjacent to the 76-story skyscraper NEMA Chicago that Crescent Heights finished in 2019, the site was once planned to get a second phase of NEMA, which would have risen approximately 900 feet and include an additional 621 units. The zoning entitlements for a tower of this scale will stay in place for a future developer to use or modify. The marketing information included that the site could have one tall tower, or two shorter buildings built in phases.  Crescent Heights has owned the property since 2012 but cite a focus on Fulton Market as reasoning for trying to offload this property. The developer has entitlements for a 38-story, 425-foot-tall residential tower at 640 W. Washington and is working through the approval process on a 615-foot-tall skyscraper at 420 N. May.  ",South Loop,0.0
1000M tops off over Grant Park,"1000M has officially topped off, with the final floor of concrete poured for the 73-story tower. Developed by Time Equities, JK Equities, and Oak Capitals, the skyscraper will tower above Grant Park providing sweeping views of the Loop and Lake Michigan.  Designed by the late Helmut Jahn, the 805-foot-tall tower features a highly sculpted form with an angled, cantilevered base topped by glass-clad residential floors that widen as the building rises. With 738 apartment units, residences will range from studios to three-bedroom penthouse units. 325 car parking spaces and 356 bike parking spaces will be included in a large parking garage at the back of the building. Future tenants will have 80,000 square feet of amenities including a golf simulator room, an outdoor swimming pool with cabanas, a cookout area, a resident lounge and commercial kitchen, an indoor pool and spa, a two-level fitness center, and a partial basketball court. With McHugh Concrete topping out the structure, general contractor McHugh Construction can continue installing the glass curtain wall and working on the interior buildout.

1000M launches marketing as tower nears topping out,"Co-developers Time Equities, JK Equities, and Oak Capitals have officially launched the marketing campaign for 1000M as the structure nears topping out. Rising above Grant Park in the South Loop, the 73-story tower is set to transform the Chicago skyline. With a newly launched website – www.1000MChicago.com - interested renters can be the first to get priority invites to tour the property’s showroom opening this Fall, as well as sneak peaks at unit plans, renderings, construction updates, and they will be among the first to have access to select their apartment home in the new tower.  New renderings feature a glimpse of what the tower will look like when it’s complete as well as a few examples of the 738 lavish apartments in the building and the rooftop pool amenity deck for the building, just part of the over 80,000 square feet of amenity offerings for future tenants. 1000M was designed by the late, luminary German architect Helmut Jahn and his company, Jahn, which remains the architectural firm of record for the development. Renowned Chicago-based interior designer, Kara Mann, designed the apartment and amenity area interiors.  “We think that luxury apartment renters in Chicago are going to be extremely impressed with 1000M. We’ve had the benefit of time to completely redesign the apartments and public areas – every detail has been carefully optimized. We hope to exceed resident expectations, which is, of course, not an easy thing to do,” said Robert Singer, Director of Development at TEI. “And beyond the tower itself, the South Michigan Ave/Grant Park/Museum Campus neighborhood has continued its dramatic evolution into maybe the premier residential neighborhood in the city,"" Singer added. With McHugh Construction serving as the general contractor, photos show the progress of the building with the concrete structure nearly topped out and the curtain wall facade following behind it. First unit deliveries are anticipated in Spring 2024, with additional units being delivered in phases throughout the balance of 2024. ",South Loop,0.0
City Council approves housing at 1800 S. Michigan,"The Chicago City Council has approved a residential development at 1800 S. Michigan. Located along E. 18th St, the project consists of an existing building at 1801 S. Wabash and a surface parking lot at 1800 S. Michigan. With Mercy Housing in charge of the project, the development consists of the rehabilitation of the existing residential building at 1801 S. Wabash and the new construction of another affordable residential building at 1800 S. Michigan. With Nia Architects in charge of the design, the new residential building at 1800 S. Michigan will stand five stories tall, set to deliver 50 affordable residential units. The 50 residential units will be split into 39 one-beds and 11 two-beds, with residents having access to a rooftop deck and community room on the fifth floor. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will be at the corner, with the fitness center and yoga room fronting S. Michigan Ave and the E. 18th St frontage flanked with management offices, the laundry room, and computer stations for the residents. The remaining space on the ground floor will hold 14 parking spaces. Rising 63 feet tall, the building will be clad in a material palette of three different colors of brick with aluminum windows and juliet balconies to create a contextual building for the neighborhood. The ground floor facade has been designed with storefront glazing to enhance the pedestrian experience along the building. The existing building will have no significant changes to the building structure, but the interior will be renovated and reconfigured with a new interior layout. The ground floor will hold the in-house management offices, a residential lobby, package room, an activity room, a recreation room, and a fitness center. The SRO building will be converted into 100 studio units that will be fully affordable. Behind the building, the courtyard will get new amenities including a playground and bike storage. As mentioned, the development will be an entirely affordable project. With a total of 150 units, the apartments will be income-restricted to an average of 60% AMI. This distinction will allow for some of the units to be rented at 80% AMI, allowing Mercy Housing to continue providing housing to some current residents in the Wabash building who are over the 60% AMI threshold.  With City Council approval secured, the sites will be rezoned from DX-5 and DR-3 to a unified DR-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. The project is seeking city funding before moving forward with construction. ",South Loop,1.0

The tower will top out at 115 feet with mechanical screens blocking the mechanical units from view. The project received a series of variances from the Zoning Board of Appeals. The first approval was for a special use to establish a residential use below the second floor. The first variation was to reduce the rear setback from the required 30' to 15'. The second variation will allow alternative compliance with the open space requirements for the project. Due to the constrained lot size and dimensions, the third variation allows for the reduction of off-street parking spaces from the required thirty-seven to four. The final variation was to permit a proposed 14' wide driveway to access the development despite its location on a pedestrian street due to the lack of alley access. With ZBA approval, CMK Development can move forward with the project at this site. Permits have yet to be filed or issued and a timeline is currently unknown. ",South Loop,0.0
Urbanize tours The Reed,"Urbanize recently toured The Reed, a 41-story residential tower at 234 W. Polk that first welcomed residents at the beginning of June. As a hybrid between rental apartments and condominiums, The Reed is the second residential high-rise in Lendlease’s 7-acre Southbank master plan development which is rising up along the Chicago River in the South Loop. Designed by Perkins & Will, the high-rise features an industrial-modern aesthetic, with a sleek dark exterior that transitions seamlessly through to interiors, which showcase 9-foot custom-finish concrete ceilings, wide-plank wood flooring and expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. With the tour led by Lendlease, we began by walking through the lobby which includes a fireplace, hospitality-style bar, and a variety of seating configurations for remote work and small social gatherings. Overlooking the river, the building will have a public riverwalk that passes by the lobby to connect to Southbank Park.  Heading up into the building, we next looked at a series of model units within the building. Out of the 440 total units, 224 of them are rental apartments and they are located on floors 9 through 22. The mix includes studios, convertibles, one-beds, two-beds, and three-beds ranging from 544 to 1,417 square feet, with monthly rents starting at $2,205 for studios and convertibles, $2,610 for one-bedrooms, $3,880 for two-bedrooms, and $5,430 for three-bedrooms. Apartment kitchens include stainless steel appliances, honed black granite countertops and flat-panel, soft-close cabinetry with under-cabinet lighting. Baths feature frameless glass showers, quartz countertops and Hansgrohe and Kohler fixtures. Residences offer views of the downtown skyline, adjacent Southbank Park and Chicago River, per plan, and select units also include balconies. Stopping next on the 8th floor, The Reed offers a full floor of amenities for the tenants. The interior offers an expansive fitness center that connects to the outdoor exercise area and includes dedicated HIIT and yoga spaces; a wet lounge adjacent to the pool deck; show kitchen and dining room; lounge room with TVs, a pool table and seating areas that can double as workspaces; virtual sports simulation room; salon; massage room; and media room. Heading outside, the outdoor deck features a series of grilling stations and outdoor seating that face the river, while the south side of the deck will be home to The Roof Crop at The Reed, whose green rooftop will house flower beds and U-Pick gardens, as well as apiaries from which honey will be harvested for use by residents and local businesses. On the north side of the amenity deck, the main feature is a large pool that is surrounded by seating and cabanas while complemented by a sunning lawn and fire pits for residents to gather around. Residents can take in the expansive views of downtown and The Willis Tower from this outdoor deck while also overlooking Southbank Park, the central open space of the development designed by Hoerr Schaudt. Like other multifamily buildings in Lendlease’s portfolio, The Reed is designed to achieve LEED Gold, Fitwel and ENERGY STAR certification, a reflection of the company’s focus on sustainability and wellness. The first building in Chicago to use a proprietary low-carbon concrete during construction, The Reed supports the company’s goal to achieve absolute zero carbon by 2040.   Furnished models and a new leasing center in the building are now available for tours seven days a week. Appointments are preferred, but walk-ins will be accommodated based on availability. For more information or to schedule a tour, call (312) 260-9797 or visit www.thereedsouthbank.com.

Urbanize Wrapped: Chicago’s Most Anticipated Projects in 2024,"After reflecting on 2023 with Urbanize Chicago’s Top Ten Articles of 2023, it’s time to look forward to some of the most anticipated developments in 2024. Here are some of the biggest projects we're looking forward to seeing progress on in 2024: Bally’s Casino With Bally’s temporary facility up and running at Medinah Temple, Bally’s Corporation can turn their attention towards the site of their permanent facility planned at 777 W. Chicago. With approval secured from the Illinois Gaming Board for their permanent license, Bally’s is working towards beginning construction in 2024 after they take control of the site this summer. With Gensler leading the redesign, foundation permits for the casino have already been filed. -- Lincoln Yards Chicago developer Sterling Bay missed their goal of breaking ground on the next phase of Lincoln Yards in 2023. While site plan approval was secured and permits are pending for the next two buildings, Sterling Bay has struggled to piece together financing for Lincoln Yards, putting the future of the megadevelopment in question. In 2024 we’ll be watching to see if Sterling Bay can secure a new financing structure to fund the required infrastructure work and development overall to allow for more buildings to start on the property. -- Halsted Pointe While this development also missed their goal of breaking ground in 2023, developer Onni Group received approval for the redesign to the first phase in June 2023 and have permits in the works to break ground sometime in 2024. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the first phase will be a 46-story, 497-foot-tall tower with 460 apartments, 200 parking spaces, and 18,900 square feet of retail. -- 1000M After construction was halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, developers of 1000M switched the tower from 421 condos to 738 rentals and secured new financing at the end of 2021. With construction back in full swing through 2022 and 2023, the tower is set to welcome residents this summer 2024. -- Thompson Center After the saga of trying to sell the Thompson Center, the purchase by The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group means the building will be saved from the wrecking ball. With Google on board to occupy the building after its redevelopment, work is expected to begin in 2024 on the initial demolition of the facade and interiors, with the late Helmut Jahn’s firm Jahn/ leading the redesign. -- 400 Lake Shore Drive Over 15 years after the demise of the Chicago Spire proposal, construction is finally underway on a new skyscraper development at 400 Lake Shore Drive. Led by Related Midwest, the SOM-designed skyscraper will reach 875 feet tall with 635 rental units inside. Crews will begin below-grade work, including caissons, sheeting, and the cofferdam in 2024 for the northern tower, with construction set to finish in Q3 2027. The southern tower will begin sometime following the first, set to be either condos or rentals based on market conditions. -- LaSalle Street Reimagined After the Lightfoot Administration launched and judged proposals for the redevelopment of office properties on LaSalle Street, newly elected Mayor Brandon Johnson has been quiet on the future of city funding lined up for these proposals via the city’s TIF coffers downtown. In 2024, we’re looking to see if the new budget that pulls money out of TIF districts means the end of city funding for these series of proposals or if Mayor Johnson will work with DPD and DOH to push them forward.  -- Redefine the Drive IDOT and CDOT showed off renderings of the potential future conditions of an expanded North Jean-Baptiste Pointe DuSable Lake Shore Drive between Grand Ave and Hollywood Ave in 2023. 2024 will see the announcement of the decision of their preferred design plan for the redevelopment.

Urbanize Wrapped: Chicago’s Top Ten Articles of 2023,"Reflecting on 2023, Urbanize Chicago wrote over 600 articles about commercial real estate, architecture, construction, and urbanism in our city. Despite a tumultuous economy, many developments rose and wrapped up construction this year and numerous projects were approved throughout the year. While new starts were fewer than previous years, we recently got to share a rare groundbreaking in 2023 at 919 W. Fulton after the developers secured financing. Before we begin 2024, we thought we’d share the stories that you all read the most. Here is Urbanize Wrapped: Chicago’s Top Ten Articles of 2023: 10. Tribune East Tower may still happen Almost three years after the tower was originally approved, Urbanize reported that developer CIM Group has publicized a bidding opportunity for the development on their website. Shortly after our reporting and other outlets shared the news, the bidding opportunity disappeared from the site with no official comments from the developer. Designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the supertall skyscraper will stand 1,442 feet, just 8 feet shy of Willis Tower’s 1,450 feet.

First phase of Kennedy Expressway work wraps up,"IDOT has announced the completion of the first phase of the rehabilitation of the Kennedy Expressway, spanning from the Edens Expressway junction all the way down to W. Ohio St. This past year of construction focused on improvements to the inbound lanes and bridge rehabilitation work. Carved through the northwest neighborhoods of Chicago, the Kennedy Expressway opened back in 1960, with its latest major rehab dating back to 1994. IDOT claims the project will improve safety, traffic flow, and reliability for the more than 275,000 drivers who use the expressway every day.  In 2024, IDOT will close the reversible express lanes to modernize the system that controls the gates to the express lanes. Work on the bridge structures will be performed and pavement patching also be done. Mainline lane closures should also be expected for the installation of new LED lighting in both directions of Hubbard’s Cave. If crews can stick to the schedule, this second construction phase will wrap up by fall 2024.  The third construction season, planned for 2025, will focus on the outbound lanes. Two lanes will be closed at a time, with additional overnight and ramp closures needed to complete the work. To mitigate traffic during this season, the express lanes will be set for outbound traffic. Work on the LED lighting in Hubbard’s Cave will continue on the outbound lanes in this season as well. Like the first two years, crews are expected to finish this work by the fall of 2025. Projected to cost $150 million, the project will rehabilitate 36 bridge structures along the stretch, replace overhead signage, install new signs and LED lights, patch pavement, and perform structural painting. Additionally, the project will modernize the 52-year-old system that controls the gates to the express lanes and update Hubbard’s Cave with new paint and LED lighting. ",Citywide,0.0
CTA announces more scheduled service on select L lines,"The Chicago Transit Authority has announced that rail service is being added back to rail lines that saw recent, temporary reductions. The new scheduled service improves headways—the scheduled time between trains—which will result in shorter waits for riders, as well as increased reliability as the scheduled service reflects the available workforce. Effective as of yesterday, Monday, November 13, more frequent rail service will be scheduled on weekday Red, Orange and Pink Lines. Effective November 18, Saturday scheduled service on both the Brown and Orange lines will be increasing. “With the first phase of the track work on the Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line complete, we can now provide more service across the rail system,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “More service will be added in 2024 as we continue our aggressive efforts to hire and train more rail operators, which is the key to bringing back even more service.” According to the CTA, scheduled service improvements will be as follows: Weekday Saturday With the recent completion of work at Morgan Middle, a track-turnaround area along the Forest Park Branch near the UIC-Halsted station, Forest Park-bound Blue Line trains are now able to “short turn” at UIC-Halsted to head back north toward O’Hare. This puts more trains on the busiest parts of the Blue Line between downtown and O’Hare, helping to address issues of crowded trains and platforms due to increasing ridership. With Morgan Middle now available, O’Hare-bound train headways at UIC-Halsted will be scheduled every 6 -12 minutes instead of 10 -12 minutes weekdays between 6:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 6 - 7.5 minutes instead 10 minutes between 3:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. ",Citywide,0.0
Rental offerings expand outdoor fitness amenities,"With the Chicago summer weather in full swing, the amenity arms race has brought on a new offering in the latest luxury buildings as tenants prioritize health and well-being close to home. Designers and developers are responding to the trend by providing new fitness amenities that take the workout outside.   At Related Midwest’s The Row Fulton Market, the luxury rental tower’s amenity suite embraces the idea of outdoor entertainment and wellness. The Athletic Club and Wellness Studio provide renters with access to two separate terraces with a combination of hardscape and grassy surfaces that can be used for outdoor workouts. Yoga mats and select exercise equipment can be brought outside by tenants to use during their workout. Along the South Branch of the Chicago River, The Reed by Lendlease is both condos and apartments, with an expansive fitness center that offers wraparound views of the adjacent outdoor pool deck and 2-acre park to the north of the building. At the other end, the gym connects to an outdoor fitness terrace that is separate and can be used by individuals or groups. Further south, 1000 S. Clark features an outdoor track along the perimeter of the building on the amenity level of the building. Complementing the 10,000-square-foot fitness center and indoor/outdoor pool, the track equals 1 mile after 6 laps. ""The outdoor track was a true lifeline for our residents over the past few years when many recreational activities were limited, and it remains a hugely popular amenity today,"" said Diana Pittro, executive vice president of RMK Management Corp. As a small sampling of new rental offerings, these developments represent the shift towards health and well-being in the amenity offerings within the rental market in Chicago. Outdoor amenities and fitness spaces are becoming more and more common across the city. ",Citywide,0.0
"One Central study, underground development hits roadblock, and more","One Central megaproject study set to start as Dunn eyes $6.5 billion in state subsidies: At long last, the state of Illinois appears ready to begin a detailed study of whether the proposed One Central megaproject makes financial sense — a study that, depending on the results, could kill off the South Loop proposal once and for all or clear the way for developer Bob Dunn to get the $6.5 billion state subsidy he wants. The study will be conducted by a private group retained by the Illinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity. DCEO received bidders in January in response to a request for proposal and is expected to select a vendor soon. (Crain's Chicago Business) Ozingas’ underground development on Southeast Side may be dead due to mining ban: A massive underground warehouse development proposed for a long-dormant piece of former steel mill land on the Southeast Side may be dead on arrival as City Hall officials signal that a ban on mining likely prohibits the project from being approved. For more than two years, the Ozinga family, owners of the namesake concrete and materials business, has pushed the idea of a 6 million square foot commercial space below the surface that drops down 350 feet deep along the Calumet River near East 112th Street. (Chicago Sun-Times) Vintage business signs could be saved under proposed ordinance: In the 2012 book “Signs, Streets and Storefronts,” author Martin Treu wrote that old neon signs “often serve as important urban landmarks.” They “help to visually identify key locations in a city, marking them with distinct visual icons,” he wrote, and give streets “character and animation, reinforcing local history.” Mayor Brandon Johnson and his new City Council floor leader obviously agree. At Wednesday’s Council meeting, Johnson introduced an ordinance aimed at protecting Chicago’s most iconic “vintage signs,” including the Grace’s Furniture sign in Logan Square. (Chicago Sun-Times) Austin’s Landmarked Seth Warner Home, One Of Chicago's Oldest, Damaged In Fire: One of Chicago’s oldest homes caught fire early Thursday, injuring a firefighter in the process. The fire occurred at 631 N. Central Ave. with the roof suffering extensive damage, Fire Department officials said. The owner, civil rights attorney James Bowers, was asleep at home with his wife when the fire started. The couple managed to escape unharmed with their four cats, he said. Two neighbors across the street say they saw fire from the top of the roof around 1:30 a.m. Thursday, lasting for roughly an hour. Fire Department officials said one firefighter was hospitalized and is in good condition. No other injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is not yet known, officials said. The home was built by abolitionist Seth Warner in 1869 and designated last year as a Chicago landmark. (Block Club Chicago) ",Citywide,0.0
CTA set to get $200 million for new trains,"The Federal Transit Administration announced that the Chicago Transit Authority will be receiving $200 million in federal funding to replace aging railcars in the fleet to improve reliability, safety and accessibility. Funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the money is coming from the new Rail Vehicle Replacement Program, which was created to improve safety, service, and the customer experience on subways, commuter rail, and light rail systems.  ""Every day, millions of Americans rely on subways, commuter rail, and light rail to get to work or school, buy groceries, and see loved ones, but many railcars still in service are decades old and in need of replacement,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. ""These grants will help bring riders faster, safer, more reliable service on America’s rails."" For the CTA, the new funding provides the opportunity to buy up to 300 new electric propulsion passenger railcars to replace railcars that have been operating since the 1980s. This project will improve CTA’s state of good repair needs in a fleet where the average age of its railcars is nearly 40 years. Exact details about the features of the new cars and timing of their delivery are currently unknown. ",Citywide,0.0

Carmen Ave. A demolition permit has already been issued for the existing one-story retail building that currently occupies the site. Planned by DLG Management, the new construction will yield an eight-story mixed-use building. With retail space and 39 parking spaces on the ground floor, the upper seven floors will be home to 77 new residential units. Residents will also have access to 77 bike parking spaces. Designed by Jonathan Splitt Architects, the building will be clad in brick masonry with stone detailing. Rising 84 feet tall, the massing steps out over the W. Carmen Ave sidewalk and lines each facade with hanging metal balconies. While not pursuing a LEED or Green Globes certification, the building will have very minimal energy use thanks to a geothermal system set to be installed under the structure. Due to the proximity to the lakefront, the development needed the Chicago Plan Commission to approve the Lakefront Protection Ordinance application. With the full building permit issued, developer DLG Management, who is also serving as the general contractor, can begin construction on the new building. ",Uptown,0.0

Portrait welcomes residents at 948 W. Sunnyside,"Urbanize recently toured Portrait, a new mixed-use development in Uptown that has opened to residents. Located at the corner of N. Sheridan Rd and W. Sunnyside Ave, the five-story building has been developed by Mavrek Development. Designed by NORR, the building will deliver 59 residential units and 7,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. Touring with Mavrek Development and the leasing team from Peak Realty Chicago, we began by walking through the ground floor of the building. Residents enter through the lobby on W. Sunnyside Ave, which opens up to the building’s coworking amenity space that offers residents meeting rooms and space to work from home. Behind the coworking space is a large fitness center as an additional amenity. Heading up to see units, we began with a model unit on the third floor. Offering a mix of studios, junior one-beds, one-beds, and two-bedroom configurations, all of the units have private balconies and designated office nooks designed into each floor plan.  The building had its first move-ins on June 1st and is already 60% leased. Studios start at $1,693/month, junior one-beds begin at $1,816/month, one-beds start at $1,929/month, and two-bedroom units start at $2,940/month. We finished the tour by walking through the surface parking behind the building. With 36 parking spaces provided, the development team enlivened the parking area by having a local artist paint murals on the walls. Mavrek is still in conversation with retailers regarding the lease out of the 7,000 square feet of ground floor retail space that wraps the street facades of the building.  ",Uptown,0.0
Sarah’s on Lakeside breaks ground at 4737 N. Sheridan,"Sarah’s Circle has celebrated the groundbreaking of their latest project, dubbed Sarah’s on Lakeside, located at 4737 N. Sheridan. Set to replace a portion of a surface parking lot, Sarah’s Circle has partnered with Brinshore Development to deliver the supportive housing development.  With Perkins & Will in charge of the design, the new building will rise five floors, providing 28 SRO units and office space for Sarah’s Circle. A large meeting room, demo kitchen, computer lab, and laundry rooms will be available for use by the women living there. For Sarah’s Circle staff, there will be offices on the second floor including a conference room and outdoor terrace. 6 parking spaces will be provided alongside the alley. The Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units will be approximately 350 square feet and will include a refrigerator, oven, range, microwave, and individual HVAC unit. They will come furnished with a bed, dresser, nightstand, dining table and chairs. The organization will provide residents with bed linens, dishes, and cutlery.   The design of the 65-foot-tall building consists of three masses that separate the building. The base of the building is wrapped with brick and holds public space, the upper mass will hold the SRO units and office space, and the core of the building consists of a solid bar along the north side of the building. The separation reduces the scale by setting back the apartments from W. Lakeside Pl, while landscaping softens the corner of the property at the building’s entry. A mural will be painted on the north facade.   The $16 million project’s funding stack includes $4 million in multi-family program funds from the Chicago Department of Housing, approximately $3.85 million in IHDA Supporting Housing Program Funds, $1.35 million in IAHTC proceeds, roughly $3.1 million in ARO fee in-lieu funds from the 4600 N.

Committee on Design review Black Ensemble Theater development,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the Free To Be Village, a mixed-use development proposed by the Black Ensemble Theater. Planned for a site across the street from their existing space at 4450 N. Clark, the new building will rise at approximately 4427 N. Clark, replacing the one-story building that used to house the Japanese American Services Center and a parking lot. Dubbed the Free to Be Village, the project is aimed at bringing an arts and cultural destination to Uptown while forwarding Black Ensemble Theater’s goals of eradicating racism through the arts. The proposed mixed-use development will be a six-story, 78-foot-tall building that includes a 22,000-square-foot Performing Arts Education Center, 8,000-square-foot Media and Technology Center, 14,000 square feet of retail space, 50 affordable residential units and 92 new parking spaces. With the residential units set to be affordable for artists, the unit mix will include 37 one-beds and 13 two-beds. With Nia Architects and Gensler collaborating on the project, the design team began by considering three massing options, including a simple bar building, a second option that has a central plaza to activate the sidewalk, and a third option that had a full-depth open space splitting the project into two fully separated buildings.  The chosen massing begins with moving a full floor of cars below-grade, providing 71 spots underground. The ground floor provides a literary cafe at the corner of the site near the intersection of W. Sunnyside Ave and N. Clark St, with the lobby to the performing arts education center to the south of it. Retail occupies the center of the floor plate, with the residential lobby at the south end of the site. At the back, the remaining 21 parking spaces are accessed along the alley. Going up, the media and tech building rises at the corner, and the performance arts education center sits just south of it. The residential building rises separately on the southern half of the property with an angled massing. The design team studied different facade treatments for the media and tech building alongside the performing arts education center, with two more opaque concepts that use different materials and colors and a third concept that reads as a glass box with colorful volumes inside. The first two ideas were deemed too visually heavy and the glass box one wouldn’t have been ideal considering its energy use. The refined concept presented in the meeting uses a glazing system shaded by a twisted wooden louver. The residential portion also underwent facade studies playing with the colors and facade materials. With Site Design Group in charge of the landscaping, the project’s open space is viewed as the heart of the building, as a space to connect with the community and have them connect with the programming in the building. With two levels of public space, the design calls for a sloped walkway that creates an amphitheater of seating and planters to connect the public plaza to a public rooftop deck on the second floor. To close the upper terrace at night, a perforated screen wall creates an opportunity for commissioning an art piece or mural instead of simply creating a harsh barrier. The development will exhibit sustainability by achieving LEED Silver and Enterprise Green Communities, as well as by decarbonizing the building, providing onsite renewables, installing green roofs, and including EV charging stations.  The discussion opened with Eleanor Gorski, who enjoyed the site plan and thought the team addressed the program in a thoughtful manner, but wondered about the scale of the building up against the three residential homes to the north along W. Sunnyside Ave. The design team responded that they have tried to maintain heights within the context as much as possible and it has been a large discussion in the community meetings they have had.  Catherine Baker chimed in with a similar concern, wondering about the north elevation of the performing arts education center and how it looked like a five-story blank wall. The design team responded that they would study the building’s facade and adjacency to the residential buildings.  Philip Enquist spoke next, commending the team on a wonderful design and expressing his thoughts that the massing and emphasis on three distinct volumes was a great way to break up the program. While agreeing that the north wall seems to need some work with the existing townhouses, Enquist thought the media tech and housing buildings worked really well and the luminous facade screened with wood was very imaginative. Enquist finished his comments by questioning what the role of the amphitheater would be on a normal day. Jackie Taylor from the Black Ensemble Theater responded that they visualized the amphitheater as a community space for the community to use as they see fit, letting them program it and activate it in their own way.  Maria Villalobos was the last person to comment, questioning the amount of retail on the ground floor. Jackie Taylor responded that the retail space is there to earn revenue for the theater while also pushing forward their mission of eradicating racism. With that in mind, Taylor said they would be working to fill the retail space only with retailers who share their vision, with hopes of including a restaurant. With input received from the committee, the development team and DPD will review and take the comments into consideration as the project moves forward. With a rezoning and Planned Development proposed, the development will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council. ",Uptown,0.0
McHugh Construction completes Platform 4611,"McHugh Construction has announced the completion of Platform 4611, a nine-story mixed-use apartment building developed by The John Buck Company and Free Market Ventures at 4611 N. Broadway. The building brings 200 rental units and approximately 9,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space to the northeast corner of N. Broadway and W. Wilson Ave, just steps from the Wilson CTA train station. “Having started on the building during the height of the pandemic, we were thrown a couple of curve balls, but our team presented creative solutions throughout the project that saved time and added value,” said Jeanne Bartels, McHugh senior project manager who oversaw the construction of Platform 4611. “From using existing foundations to strategically reduce costs to securing materials and appliances through our broad network of suppliers during the pandemic-induced supply chain challenges, McHugh was able to deliver this project on schedule and on budget.” Designed by Pappageorge Haymes, the mid-rise building features a masonry and glass façade. Levels two through eight offer a mix of studio, one-, and two-bedroom units, while the top floor includes two two-bedroom and two three-bedroom penthouse units and a host of building amenities. Units feature exposed concrete ceilings, poured and finished by McHugh Concrete, the project’s concrete subcontractor. Building features include secured elevators, a fitness center, and reservable office space on each residential floor. The rooftop amenity floor is home to a dedicated co-working space as well as an outdoor terrace offering grilling stations for residents, multiple seating areas, and sweeping views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline. As a transit-oriented development steps from the Wilson CTA train station’s Red and Purple Lines, Platform 4611 also offers its residents easy access to downtown Chicago as well as provides surface-level parking for 22 vehicles and interior parking from 178 bicycles.  Platform 4611 welcomed its first residents in February 2023 and was 43% occupied as of late May.

Black Ensemble Theater proposes mixed-use expansion at 4427 N. Clark,"The Black Ensemble Theater has unwrapped plans for a new mixed-use development that will expand their operations and create a cultural corridor along N. Clark St in Uptown. Planned for a site across the street from their existing space at 4450 N. Clark, the new building will rise at approximately 4427 N. Clark, replacing the one-story building that used to house the Japanese American Services Center which will be moving to West Ridge. Dubbed the Free to Be Village, the project is aimed at bringing an arts and cultural destination to Uptown while forwarding Black Ensemble Theater’s goals of advancing equality in Chicago. Split into two buildings linked at the base, the complex will include a performing arts education center, media and technology space, and affordable artists housing. The project will be split into two phases, with the performing arts, media, and technology section coming first and the housing second. Designed by Nia Architects and Gensler, the first phase will stand four floors, rising on the north side of the site near the corner of N. Clark St and W. Sunnyside Ave. Designed with a glass curtain wall and wooden louvers, the light-filled building will soar 70 feet above the site while providing space for the media center, performance hall, and educational facility. Spaces in the building will include a literary cafe, archive room, film screening room, recording studio, editing station, dance studio, and classrooms.  Rising on the south portion of the property, the housing component will include a six-story building that will include 50 apartments planned to be rented at affordable levels for artists. Clad in a combination of metal paneling and wood planks, the housing portion will offer one-beds and two-beds with a community room and two collaboration rooms as amenities. Uniting the two buildings, the ground floor will place the residential lobby at the south end of the site and the performing arts and education center entry further north. In between, three retail spaces will total 13,000 square feet. At the back of the ground floor, 21 parking spaces will be accessible along the alley and a ramp will take cars down to the basement level for another 71 parking spaces to result in 92 car parking spaces. Designed by Site Design Group, a public plaza will carve into the ground floor, creating outdoor space that will be activated with performance space, terraced seating, and lush plantings. Public art by Black artists is planned to be placed along the street. Originally envisioned all the way back in 2009 when the current Black Ensemble Theater space was proposed and built, the Free To Be Village development is moving forward with a $5 million boost from Mackenzie Scott. The full build-out is expected to cost between $50-$70 million. With the zoning plan submitted to the city, the development will need a Planned Development designation approved by the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council. If all goes according to plan, the project is set to break ground in 2024. If you’re interested in learning more, the Black Ensemble Theater will be hosting a community meeting tomorrow June 6th from 6-7pm in-person at their current location at 4450 N. Clark.

Permits issued for 871 N. Franklin at North Union,"Permits have been issued to begin the adaptive reuse of 871 N. Franklin. As part of the North Union mega development planned by JDL Development, the structure stands at the southeast corner of W. Locust St and N. Franklin St. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the adaptive reuse will convert the three-story brick building into a mixed-use building with a two-story addition.

Zoning application filed for slender tower at 1565 N. Clybourn,"New York-based developer The Georgetown Company has submitted a rezoning application for their proposed mixed-use tower at 1565 N. Clybourn. Located at the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Halsted St, the new development will replace the retail structure that formerly held the Bank of America branch. The developer owns the four-story parking garage and the retail structure with Design Within Reach and will retain both of those structures as part of the development. With bKL Architecture on board for the design, the team sought to create something special and unique for the prominent gateway site for this area. The new mixed-use tower will rise with a very slender massing, tapering at the ends to create a unique profile. The tower’s glass and metal facade will come down to the ground without a large parking podium, meeting the ground in an elegant and pedestrian-friendly way. The facade switches to a masonry expression at the base with punched window openings to relate to the pedestrian scale. Rising 37 stories, the 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 residential units, with 79 of them set aside as affordable. The unit mix is still in flux, but will include a mix of studios, convertibles, one-beds, and two-beds. The ground floor will front N. Clybourn Ave with 2,500 square feet of retail space, with the residential entry facing back to the internal drive and north towards the pedestrian plaza designed by Confluence. Amenity space will be located on the third floor with an outdoor cutout in the building massing as well as rooftop amenities on the 37th floor which will include an outdoor pool. In regard to parking, the new building will have no new car parking spaces but will include 396 bike parking spaces on the third floor. The existing parking garage behind the new construction has 158 parking spaces. The developer plans to make 70 of them available to residents, 73 available for retail parking, and 15 spaces for employees. An internal private drive that currently exists will remain for internal circulation as well as drop off and loading. During a recent community meeting, some neighbors expressed concern over congestion in the neighborhood and the parking count for the project. The development team explained that the project’s status as a transit-served location with its proximity to the North/Clybourn L stop and CTA bus stops indicate a lower demand for parking. The development team said they are confident that the proposed parking ratio will sufficiently serve the residents and pointed out DPD’s encouragement to reduce parking near transit as part of their latest TOD ordinances. While they are at the beginning of the process, the developer is looking to rezone the site from its existing PD to B3-5 and then reinstate the Planned Development. The proposal needs approvals from Alderman Hopkins, the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. If approvals move forward according to plan, construction could begin in early 2025 with a 20–22-month construction timeline.  ",Near North,0.0

Touring with Power Construction and JDL Development, the tour began by heading up to the top of the building to the 26th floor. Set to hold the building’s amenity spaces, the floor is enclosed but sits raw with construction equipment filling up the space. At the south end, the amenity space will open up to an outdoor deck that includes a rooftop pool. An outdoor dog run will be included on the west side of the amenity level. Going one floor down, the 25th level will be the top residential floor. The floor plate is fully enclosed with the glass facade and the first mechanical systems are being installed. Working our way down the building, our next stop was the two duplex apartments on the north end of the building’s 20th and 21st floors. The 21st floor shows the units fully framed with crews installing electrical wiring during our walkthrough. On the 20th floor, crews were closing up the walls with drywall.  Heading down the building, our next stop was the 12th floor, where drywall and paint has been completed, with cabinets going in for the units’ kitchens. Stopping at the third floor, we next saw some finished units that have kitchens and bathrooms installed as well as flooring and all other finishes. Residents will benefit from nine and a half feet high ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows that give unencumbered views of the city around it. On the ground floor, we walked through the future retail space that will face north and west into the future park space. As part of the first phase of North Union, the park will open at the same time as 868 N. Wells. JDL Development plans to begin pre-leasing at the end of April 2024, with Power Construction turning over the building in July 2024 for late-Summer 2024 move-ins. As construction wraps up on 868 N. Wells, JDL Development is pushing ahead on the rest of the first phase. The existing structure at 871 N. Franklin will get a two-story addition and be converted into apartments with another restaurant tenant planned for the retail space facing the park. 220 W. Chestnut already has its foundations and parking structure poured underground but its residential programming is still yet to be finalized. ",Near North,0.0
Urbanize tours nearly complete 920 N. Wells,"Urbanize recently toured the nearly completed 920 N. Wells. As part of North Union, the new tower stands along N. Wells St, spanning from W.

450-foot-tall slender tower proposed at 1565 N. Clybourn,"New York-based developer The Georgetown Company presented their plans for a proposed mixed-use tower at 1565 N. Clybourn to the local community last night. Located at the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Halsted St, the new development will replace the retail structure that formerly held the Bank of America branch. The developer owns the four-story parking garage and the retail structure with Design Within Reach and will retain both of those structures as part of the development. With bKL Architecture on board for the design, the team sought to create something special and unique for the prominent gateway site for this area. The new mixed-use tower will rise with a very slender massing, tapering at the ends to create a unique profile. The tower’s glass and metal facade will come down to the ground without a large parking podium, meeting the ground in an elegant and pedestrian-friendly way. The facade switches to a masonry expression at the base with punched window openings to relate to the pedestrian scale. Rising 37 stories, the 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 residential units, with 79 of them set aside as affordable. The unit mix is still in flux, but will include a mix of studios, convertibles, one-beds, and two-beds. The ground floor will front N. Clybourn Ave with 2,500 square feet of retail space, with the residential entry facing back to the internal drive and north towards the pedestrian plaza designed by Confluence. Amenity space will be located on the third floor with an outdoor cutout in the building massing as well as rooftop amenities on the 37th floor which will include an outdoor pool. In regard to parking, the new building will have no new car parking spaces but will include 396 bike parking spaces on the third floor. The existing parking garage behind the new construction has 158 parking spaces. The developer plans to make 70 of them available to residents, 73 available for retail parking, and 15 spaces for employees. An internal private drive that currently exists will remain for internal circulation as well as drop-off and loading. During the meeting, some neighbors expressed concern over congestion in the neighborhood and the parking count for the project. The development team explained that the project’s status as a transit-served location with its proximity to the North/Clybourn L stop and CTA bus stops indicate a lower demand for parking. The development team said they are confident that the proposed parking ratio will sufficiently serve the residents and pointed out DPD’s encouragement to reduce parking near transit as part of their latest TOD ordinances. Neighbors asked how the developer is expecting to fill the retail space considering the high vacancy in the area. The development team responded that with the replacement of the Bank of America space they are actually decreasing the amount of retail space in the area. While it is too early for specifics, the developer discussed the potential for a food and beverage retailer or coffee shop. A neighbor asked Alderman Hopkins if approaching this development would set a precedent for the area, and Hopkins responded that this wouldn’t set a precedent and his office would evaluate each project on its own merits as they come. Hopkins discussed some of his personal opinions about the development, mentioning how he liked the omission of a large parking podium and discussed embracing the trend of less parking in buildings as people shift to using more public transportation. He qualified the statement with the fact that they need to engage with CDOT and the private traffic engineer to address the potential traffic and congestion impacts and settle that before the project could move forward. While they are at the beginning of the process, the developer is looking to rezone the site from its existing PD to B3-5 and then reinstate the Planned Development. If approvals move forward according to plan, construction could begin in early 2025 with a 20–22-month construction timeline. The development needs approvals from Alderman Hopkins, the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. ",Near North,0.0
The Seng surpasses 50% sold,"Chicago-based Structured Development has announced The Seng, its new all-affordable condominium building on Chicago’s Near North Side, is more than halfway sold out, with 20 of its 34 below-market-rate homes closed or under contract. Resident move-ins are now underway. “Having over half of The Seng units under contract illustrates the demand for entry-level homeownership in gentrified neighborhoods like Lincoln Park,” said Mike Drew, co-founding principal of Structured Development. “We are proud to be a part of the buyer’s homeownership journey, particularly at a time when working Chicagoans are faced with rising expenses and a shrinking supply of attainable for-sale housing options. We look forward to welcoming additional residents to The Seng and helping them in their very first opportunity to build wealth through homeownership.” The Seng offers two-, three- and four-bedroom units for income-qualified households earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Buyers also must be preapproved for a traditional, FHA or VA loan and be certified through a homeownership program administered by the Chicago Housing Trust. Two-bedroom floor plans range from 824-868 square feet and are priced from $285,134; three-bedroom residences range from 988-1,186 square feet and are priced from $333,734; and four-bedroom homes range from 1,153-1,378 square feet and are priced from $374,696. The Chicago Housing Trust began accepting applications for The Seng earlier this year. Designed by GREC Architects, the five-story development at 869 W. Blackhawk is the first all-affordable condo building of its kind in Chicago. It is one of three new residential buildings in Structured Development’s Wendelin Park master plan, which includes a mix of affordable for-sale, co-living and market-rate rental housing oriented around a new publicly accessible park.  Residences at The Seng showcase large windows that fill the homes with natural light, 9-foot ceilings and modern finishes. Kitchens feature GE stainless steel appliances, Kohler chrome faucets, quartzite countertops and two-tone cabinetry. Condos also include in-unit laundry, and each comes with a deeded garage parking space. Accessible residences are included in the development’s unsold inventory. Shared amenities include a communal rooftop terrace with sweeping views of the city; secure bike storage; and a fitness center equipped with treadmills, stationary bikes, elliptical equipment and weights.

868 N. Wells tops out at North Union,"Urbanize has toured the construction site of the recently topped out 868 N. Wells at North Union. Planned by JDL Development, the building occupies a rectangular site along N. Wells St stretching from W. Chestnut St to W. Locust St. With a design by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, 868 N. Wells will stand 26 floors high with 411 rental units and 12,000 square feet of retail space. Touring with Power Construction and JDL Development, the tour began by heading up to the roof of the building where the final concrete slab had just been poured in the morning. Crews were finishing the concrete slab while the tower crane worked on removing the windscreens from around the structure. One floor below will be the 26th level, which is the highest accessible floor for residents and will be home to a full suite of amenities. On the south end will be an outdoor pool deck with seating, while the north end will have grilling stations and outdoor space. On the interior, there will be a club room, coworking space, and a demo kitchen. Currently, the floor is a forest of scaffolding and pole shores holding up the formwork for the concrete pour above. Working our way down the building, our stop on the 21st floor saw the clearing out of the pole shores and the first mechanical ducts and piping being installed. On the 17th floor, crews had begun skim coating the concrete ceilings that will measure nine and a half feet high and installing metal tracks for the framing.   On the 14th floor, workers were installing the track for the facade system, with window panels being installed just below on the 13th floor.  Heading down the building, framing has begun on floors with the facade installed and drywall is being installed as high up as the fourth floor. We stopped at the second floor to see the building’s fitness center that overlooks the park to the west.  At the base of the building, the planned 129 parking spaces are located in an underground garage. On the ground floor, retail space will be located both at the north and south ends of the building with an intention to bring in restaurant tenants to help develop a neighborhood feel for the development.  With the structure topped out and glass about halfway up, Power Construction is set to complete the building by July 2024. The park to the west of the tower is set to come online with the opening of 868 N. Wells.  To round out the block, the existing structure at 871 N. Franklin will get a two-story addition and be converted into apartments with another restaurant tenant planned for the retail space facing the park. 220 W.

CDC approves TIF for 520 W. Hobbie,"The Community Development Commission has approved TIF funding for mixed-income housing at 520 W. Hobbie. Located on a large site, the new development will occupy a site bound by W. Hobbie St to the south, N. Cleveland Ave to the east, and N. Cambridge Ave to the west. Developed as part of the Parkside of Old Town development, developers Holsten Real Estate Development Corporation and Cabrini Green LAC Community Development Corporation are collaborating on the project.  With Landon Bone Baker Architects and Brook Architecture collaborating on the design, this latest phase of the overall projects includes three buildings. Consisting of an eight-story midrise building and an assortment of townhomes and walk-up buildings, this development will deliver 93 new units, encompassing 35 CHA replacement units, 30 affordable units, 34 market rate units. Of the 93 apartments, there will be 9 studios, 28 one-beds, 27 two-beds, 21 three-beds, and 8 four-beds. 65 surface parking spaces will occupy the interior of the block.     Located along W. Hobbie St, LBBA is leading the charge on the 8-story midrise building. Set to rise 105 feet, the building will hold 69 of the aforementioned 93 units. Designed in a precast concrete system, faceted panels will be used to emphasize the base, with upper floors clad in white panels with a staggered window pattern to break up the facade. To reduce the bulk of the building, setbacks are incorporated into the upper floors that provide common and private rooftop decks for residents. The residential entry will sit at the southwest corner of the building and connect residents to the lobby as well as an adjacent community room and management offices. Fronting N. Cambridge Ave and N. Cleveland Ave, Brook Architecture has designed a series of three-story townhome and walk-up buildings. Divided into three buildings, they will provide the final 24 units for the site. Arranged to define the street edge, each building will also be built of precast concrete with varied heights and steps in elevations to break up the scale along each street.   The $65.78 million development will be funded with $16.4 million in TIF, $4.25 million in multifamily loan funds, $17 million in LIHTC equity, $4.6 million donation tax credit equity, $11.6 million from a first mortgage, $330,000 from a ComEd Energy grant, and $500,000 in the form of a deferred developer fee.

Urbanize tours Foundry at Wendelin Park,"Urbanize recently toured Foundry, the third and largest building under construction at Wendelin Park, a new mixed-use development in the Near North Side. Planned by White Oak Realty Partners in collaboration with Structured Development, the building fits into an overall three-building plan that is centered around a new public park on the larger site bound by W. Blackhawk, N. Dayton, and N. Kingsbury Streets. Foundry itself, designed by FitzGerald, is set to stand 299 feet while delivering 327 market-rate rental units. Touring with Structured Development and Power Construction, we began by heading up to the rooftop amenity deck on the 26th and 27th floors. Starting on the 26th floor, we walked around a deck that will have a pool and lots of outdoor space for residents that faces the city skyline to the south. An outdoor forum stair is part of the design, connecting the 26th and 27th floors while offering residents a spot to sit and look at the skyline above the protective glass walls. The 27th floor will have more indoor amenities in addition to that on the 26th level, as well as a hot tub at the top of the forum stair. Our next stop was the 5th floor, which is the first floor of units above the three floors of parking in the podium. Units have been built up with interior wall framing, drywall, and kitchen finishes already installed. Stepping out onto the roof deck, units will get private terraces with the remaining space planned for inaccessible green roofs. Select units on the upper floors will get projecting balconies. We finished the tour by walking through the ground floor, which will hold retail space at the corner of W. Blackhawk St and N. Kingsbury St. The residential entry will be midblock with the lobby spanning the entire width of the building east/west to connect to the Paseo and out to the future park space. The south end of the ground floor will hold mechanical spaces and the parking ramp up to the planned 142 parking spaces. The exterior wall has been mostly installed with interior finishes still on hold until progress on the tower above comes closer to completion. With Power Construction pushing ahead on the construction, the tower is scheduled for completion by the end of the year. With the construction plan not calling for any phased turnovers, the entire building will be available to residents to move in when it opens in December.  ",Near North,0.0
Urbanize tours Post Chicago at Wendelin Park,"Urbanize recently toured Post Chicago, a newly completed co-living residential development at Wendelin Park, a new mixed-use development in the Near North Side. Planned by Structured Development, the overall three-building, 487-unit community is centered around a new public park on the larger site that is bound by W. Blackhawk, N. Dayton, and N. Kingsbury Streets. Touring with Structured Development, we began in the residential lobby which overlooks W. Blackhawk St. The ground floor includes a full suite of amenities with a large coworking space that has large tables, working booths and tables all facing south to the future Wendelin Park. Residents will also have access to a fitness center, community room, and party lounge that also face the future park. The back of the floor plate is home to a parking garage for 43 cars which can be rented by tenants. Heading up into the building, we toured a series of the co-living apartments in the building. While there are 19 traditional apartments, we did not see them on the tour. The majority of the building is co-living apartments, operated by provider Tripalink. These 107 units are either 3-bed/2-bath or 4-bed/3-bath, and are rented by the room, so tenants would have roommates that they share the common spaces with.  Touring two model units, the apartments are designed with luxury finishes, in-unit laundry, and come fully furnished down to the silverware in the kitchen for residents. With a staggered layout, 4-bedroom units have two bedrooms up against the outside wall of the building that share a bathroom, and two units inset from the facade that have their own bathrooms. These inset bedrooms gain natural light through indents in the massing of the building which gives its blocky or serrated character. Heading down the building, we stopped on the second floor which houses the outdoor roof deck. Residents will be able to use the provided grilling stations, fire pits, and seating to look south towards the downtown skyline and look over the future Wendelin Park, the overall development’s last phase of the project.

City Council approves a revised plan for 330 W. Chestnut,"The Chicago City Council has approved revised plans for a residential development at 330 W. Chestnut. Located at the northeast corner of W. Chestnut St and N. Orleans St, the project site is currently a vacant lot adjacent to the CTA L tracks. Draper and Kramer is the developer behind the proposal. With FitzGerald in charge of the project’s design, the building will stand nine stories above street level. Rising 126 feet, it will include 128 luxury apartments, with a unit mix of 64 convertibles, 48 one-beds, and 16 two-beds. For the affordable requirement, 26 units will be set aside as affordable, including 13 convertibles, 10 one-beds, and three two-beds. As part of the redesign, the previously planned retail space has been eliminated. Parking for cars has been increased from 11 to 13 and the 80 bike parking spaces remain. On the ground floor, the redesign has moved the fitness center to the N. Orleans St frontage while expanding the parking to add two spaces and create an interior driveway that reduces the garage doors down to one main access point for cars. The bike parking spaces have been moved into a separate interior room rather than being in with the cars and the back of house spaces have been expanded to accommodate the building’s needs. On the facade, a series of balconies have been enclosed to make more interior space. At the southwest corner of the building, the slender massing used to have two bays of balconies, but the western bay has been enclosed to leave one bay of balconies. On the east facade, the southernmost bay was already enclosed, with the rest of them as open balconies. As part of the redesign, the second bay from the south end has been enclosed to create a larger interior space at that end. With approval from the City Council, the redesigned project is now fully approved. While a timeline for construction has not been announced, the $43 million development can move forward with securing financing and pulling permits. ",Near North,1.0
Post Chicago opens as Chicago’s largest co-living building,"Chicago developer Structured Development recently announced the opening of a model unit at Post Chicago, a 10-story, 431-bed co-living community. Located at 853 W.

Co-living residents share access to a furnished living room, kitchen and in-unit washer/dryer, as well as a bathroom for those who don’t have their own ensuite bath. “Co-living at Post Chicago is a fun, affordable way to reside in one of the city’s most walkable neighborhoods while making new friends and experiencing all there is to do in this area,” said Jeff Berta, senior director of real estate development at Structured Development, the firm behind the three-building residential project that includes Post Chicago. “For many households, rent is their biggest monthly expense, so Post Chicago is another way we are promoting equitable housing in a location that might otherwise be unattainable.” Tripalink, which currently operates over 8,000 beds nationally, will manage and lease the property, with an on-site resident services coordinator who will help organize group activities. Cable and high-speed internet are included in monthly rents, and residents also benefit from weekly cleaning service, a community app and full suite of building amenities, including a fitness center, lounge areas for working and socializing, a rooftop deck with grilling stations, bike room with repair station and package room. There will be 43 paid parking spaces available for resident use. In addition to the co-living units, Post Chicago will offer 19 conventional unfurnished apartments in studio and two-bedroom layouts, with monthly rents starting at $1,799.

The development’s ARO obligation is for 26.4 units, so the developer is providing 26 units on site at an average of 60% AMI and paying $60,000 in a fee in-lieu for the remaining 0.4 of a unit. With approval from the Chicago Plan Commission, the proposal will head to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. A timeline for the $40 million project has not been announced. ",Near North,1.0
Construction has completed on The Seng,"Chicago-based Structured Development recently announced that it has completed construction and opened a new model unit at The Seng, its 34-unit affordable condominium building at 869 W. Blackhawk. As the first of three residential buildings totaling 487 units to be completed at Wendelin Park (formerly Big Deahl), the Seng will sit on a site bounded by W. Blackhawk St, N. Dayton St and N. Kingsbury St. Offering two-beds, three-beds, and four-bedroom units to income-restricted buyers, all homes at The Seng are reserved for individuals earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Buyers also must be preapproved for a traditional, FHA or VA loan and be certified through a homeownership program administered by the Chicago Housing Trust. Two-bedroom floor plans range from 824-868 square feet and are priced at $285,134. The new model unit showcases one of the development’s three-bedroom floor plans, which range from 988-1,186 square feet and are priced at $333,734, while four-bedroom residences range from 1,153-1,378 square feet and are priced at $374,696. “The Seng is an example of the city’s leadership in addressing a broad range of affordable and workforce housing needs, including a lack of quality, entry-level homes for those who would otherwise be priced out of many neighborhoods,” said Mike Drew, co-founding principal of Structured Development. “Faced with rising home prices and interest rates, many working individuals and families have given up on homeownership in Chicago. But inclusionary options like The Seng allow them to purchase a newly constructed condominium well below market rates while ensuring those homes remain affordable should buyers ever decide to move.”  CHT will begin accepting applications for the Seng on Feb. 27 and shared additional guidelines. Given high demand, CHT will accept applications for two-bedroom units between Feb. 27 and March 10 and conduct a lottery drawing on March 16. CHT has set an occupancy requirement of three or more persons for the three-bedroom units and will accept applications for these units on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning Feb. 27. CHT has set an occupancy requirement of four or more persons for the four-bedroom units and will accept applications on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning Feb. 27. Designed by GREC Architects, The Seng offers family-friendly floor plans with large windows that fill the homes with abundant natural light, 9-foot ceilings and modern finishes. Kitchens feature GE stainless steel appliances, Kohler chrome faucets, quartzite counters and two-tone cabinetry. Condos also include in-unit laundry, and each comes with a deeded garage parking space. Accessible residences are available. Residents will have access to a shared rooftop terrace, a fitness center, and bike storage. The Seng is named for Wendelin Seng, a German immigrant who founded a furniture manufacturing factory on the site in 1874. Among other items, the company mass-produced furniture hardware and introduced early sofa-sleepers and recliner chairs, according to company history. The building’s lobby design will feature wall art and original artifacts recovered from a 1902 time capsule found on the site during construction, all commemorating Seng and his company.  The other residences are Post Chicago (formerly Common Lincoln Park), a 10-story, 432-bed co-living community to be operated by New York-based Common; and the Foundry, a 27-story, 327-unit market-rate rental tower scheduled to be complete at the end of 2023. All three residential buildings are centered around the new 26,000-square-foot Wendelin Park, privately developed by Structured as a public amenity with a nature play area, dog run, community garden and gathering areas.

Developer seeks new path for conversion at 30 N. LaSalle,"With the future of the LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative in question, developers Golub & Company and Corebridge Financial have submitted a zoning application that would allow them to move forward with the adaptive reuse without city funding or an affordable housing requirement. Located at 30 N. LaSalle, the 44-story tower was originally built in 1974 and is only 46% leased with a contiguous 12 vacant floors in the bottom of the tower ready for reuse. While the top 20 floors would remain as office space, the lower set of floors would be converted into 349 apartments. The existing office lobby, Amalgamated Bank retail space, and Starbucks retail space would remain in their current locations, while Einstein Bagels will move to the west side of the Washington St frontage to make space for a new residential lobby. Residents would have access to 100 bike parking spaces and a dog run on the ground floor, as well as coworking space and a party room on the second floor.  Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the exterior of the building would be largely the same, except for the installation of new windows at the residential units. At the 11th floor, residents would benefit from a new projecting terrace that features a host of indoor/outdoor amenity spaces. The projecting terrace would be complemented with a resident lounge, party room, and fitness center on the interior of the 11th floor. Planning to expand and improve the streetscape, landscape architects Confluence have been tapped for a full redesign of the streetscape around the building. The developers had been asking for $62 million in TIF through the LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative to help pay for the estimated $143 million conversion in exchange for providing 30% of the units as affordable. By rezoning the building from its Planned Development to DC-16, the conversion could happen by-right, or without another zoning change, providing a second path to fruition for the project as Mayor Johnson leaves the series of proposals along LaSalle Street in limbo, awaiting news of whether the funding initiative will move forward or not. This option of doing the project by-right would also mean that the new apartments would not have to comply with the affordable housing requirements that apply to developments that seek a Planned Development designation or rezoning. A timeline for the rezoning and potential construction is unclear, but the developers touted the ability for a quick turnaround when proposed under the LaSalle Street Reimagined program, citing a potential December 2023 start and early 2025 completion, indicating just over a year for construction.

Final landmark recommendation approved for Century & Consumers Buildings,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the Century and Consumers Buildings, sending the proposed designation to City Hall. With $52 million in federal funds approved to demolish the towers, the GSA is citing security and safety reasons for the Dirksen Courthouse as reasoning to clear this corner of the Loop. As the GSA has been going through the Section 106 process of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the structure at 208-212 S. State was demolished due to its poor condition and the fire escapes on the Century Building were removed. Built in 1915-16, the Century Building at 202 S. State is a strong example of an early 20th century commercial style building which was essentially an early urban mall, with shops on multiple levels where customers would pass through and shop. Designed by Holabird & Roche, the tower is designed with the fundamentals of the Chicago School with technological advancements that allowed for taller buildings with more glass and windows. The tower’s overall slenderness, narrow mullions, and recessed spandrel panels gave a sense of verticality to the building that was accentuated with its white glazed terracotta cladding.  The landmark designation will identify significant features of the Century Building as all exterior elevations including rooflines as well as the first and second floor exterior which exhibits the 1950’s remodel in the International Style. Due to the adjacency to the Dirksen Courthouse and the GSA’s required reuse criteria, the designation would allow for flexibility in allowing building modifications so that a viable reuse could meet all 15 required criteria set forth by the GSA. Built just a few years earlier, the Consumers Building was completed in 1913 by developer Jacob L. Kesner, with Mundie and Jensen as the architects. Located at 220 S. State, the tower was built as a professional office building with extensive retail space on the lower floors. Also built in the commercial style with the tradition of Chicago School, the building’s steel frame is expressed by a more solid grid-like pattern of narrow, vertical piers and horizontal spandrel bands. The building also retains its lavish interior lobby, with carrera marble on the walls and ceilings with classical revival detailing. A marble staircase sits in an alcove while the space is adorned with decorative bronze fixtures.  The landmark designation will identify significant features of the Consumers Building as all exterior elevations including rooflines as well as the main entrance vestibule and elevator lobby. Due to the adjacency to the Dirksen Courthouse and the GSA’s required reuse criteria, the designation would allow for flexibility in allowing building modifications so that a viable reuse could meet all 15 required criteria set forth by the GSA. With the GSA continuing the Section 106 process, a draft Environmental Impact Statement released reported that demolition would have a “negative, moderate effect” while adaptive reuse would have a “beneficial, moderate impact.” The final Record of Decision is expected to be announced in February 2024.  With final landmark recommendation approval from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the proposed designation will head to City Hall to get votes from the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council. If the city approves the landmark status of the buildings, it will tee up a fight with the federal government who can ultimately decide to still demolish the buildings due to the fact that federal power overrules local ordinances.  ",The Loop,0.0
Google releases renderings of Thompson Center redevelopment,"Google today has released new renderings of their planned redevelopment of the Thompson Center. Google has called Chicago home since 2000 and it continues to invest in the city as it emerges as one of the nation’s most diverse and vibrant tech hubs with many of their partners and customers based there.  With the redevelopment being led by The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group, Google plans to honor the postmodern legacy of the building. Working with Jahn, the building’s reimagining will bring it into the 21st century while maintaining its iconic form. The Thompson Center’s signature 17-story, light-filled atrium will remain. Additionally, the covered colonnade at the base of the building will be redesigned to allow for an enhanced ground floor experience, including opportunities for more food and beverage retail and seasonal activations of the plaza. When it opened, the Thompson Center was intended to be a new kind of gathering space for Chicagoans. After all, it’s the only building in the city where six L train lines converge, connecting Chicago’s South, West and North sides. With a new and improved CTA experience, the Thompson Center will continue to serve commuters and will be perfectly positioned to welcome current and future employees from every corner of Chicago. Google hopes the reimagined building will become a thriving community destination for all Chicagoans in a revitalized Loop neighborhood. With a goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, Google plans to run their offices on clean energy with an important first step of making their offices require less energy in the first place. In order to achieve their pledge of creating a LEED Platinum, all-electric building, the building’s facade and internal systems will be completely replaced. The new triple-pane glass exterior will improve both the thermal performance of the building and the comfort of those inside by requiring less energy to heat and cool. Additionally, it will modernize the way the building looks, and maximize natural daylight and views. Outdated heating and cooling equipment will be replaced with high-efficiency systems as well. At the southeast perimeter of the structure, covered terraces along three levels will offer new greenspaces. With more natural light, access to greenspace, and biophilic design elements that borrow from nature, the original design’s ode to transparency and openness will live on.  Construction activity at the site of the Thompson Center is expected to begin soon, starting with fencing going up around the perimeter early next year. The upcoming improvements will take several years to complete and Google plans to share more about their plans in the future, according to a release shared with the media. ",The Loop,0.0
Permit issued to demolish Thompson Center facade,"A permit has been issued to demolish the Thompson Center’s facade and atrium. After renderings of the redevelopment were revealed in December 2021 and Google signed on to acquire the building in June 2022, this permit is the first sign of movement on the reconstruction of the structure at 100 W. Randolph.  Originally designed by Helmut Jahn and completed in 1985, the architect’s namesake firm Jahn will return to the building to facilitate the redesign for Google’s office space. The work will strip the building down to the structure and rebuild it as a high-tech building with the unique atrium and form that is the Thompson Center. The redevelopment will install a new curtain wall to reduce the building’s high mechanical costs and reduce noise in the atrium. Landscaping will be added to stepped terraces within the curved edifice. While initial concept renderings were shared back in 2021, the scope of the redevelopment has been kept under wraps. The original sale agreement had The Prime Group buying the building for $70 million and the state would have bought back approximately ⅓ of the 1.2 million square feet to reoccupy the building, paying $148 million. Remaining space inside the building was considered for more offices or as a hotel.  While permits are underway for the project, final renderings or plans have not been released to show how the redesign has been adjusted since Google announced its plans to enter a build-to-suit lease with The Prime Group which will result in the building being turned over to Google as the eventual occupant and owner. Clark Construction is listed as the general contractor for the $280 million development which is expected to wrap up in 2026. ",The Loop,0.0
Assemble Chicago gains YMCA as anchor tenant,"Assemble Chicago, the winning proposal of the C40 Reinventing Cities competition, has landed the YMCA as an anchor tenant at the base of the mixed-use development. Planned for a city-owned site in The Loop, the project site at 331 S. Plymouth consists of a city-owned parking garage and a series of smaller parcels on the western edge of Pritzker Park. Bound by S. Plymouth Ct and W. Van Buren St, the rectangular parcel also has an alley running through it that will be vacated. Originally announced back in 2021, the proposal is being led by The Community Builders and Studio Gang, with DesignBridge and JAQ collaborating on the design. The winning submission will encompass a net-zero carbon, 20-story mixed-use structure that will replace a vacant parking garage and four city-owned parcels. Housing residential and commercial space, it will provide 207 residential units priced for incomes ranging from 30 percent AMI to 80 percent AMI.  The podium will feature 14,000 square feet of space for the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago, encompassing a half-gymnasium, fitness equipment, a drop-in childcare center, and space for youth programming. Space for a restaurant on the ground floor will also be included and there will be zero parking spaces. Uniting a dynamic public program with integrated, sustainable systems and efficient materials, the proposition will meet the competition’s 10 Challenges for Climate with a site-specific design that provides a new model to simultaneously address the urgent issues of climate change and inequality in cities. The building will utilize solar panels, a rooftop water tank, heat recovery, no fossil fuels for appliances, efficient structure and facade design, a rooftop garden, and a backup generator. The approximately $102 million proposal will also commit $2 million toward Pritzker Park improvements. Upgrades to Pritzker Park will include a spray fountain, community stage, rain garden, extensive landscaping, and restrooms. Details will be finalized through a Chicago Park District-led community engagement process. The developer initially sought to begin work on the $102 million development by the end of 2021, but challenges in landing low-income housing tax credits and other pieces of a planned capital stack have delayed the process. With YMCA secured as a tenant for the commercial space, the development team anticipates securing construction financing by next summer and beginning construction on the project in 2025. According to a report from Crain's, the project still requires City Council approval for the scope of the development and to acquire the city-owned land for a write down of $1. ",The Loop,1.0
Rezoning introduced to nullify plan for 130 N. Franklin,"Alderman Reilly of the 42nd Ward has submitted a rezoning proposal to downzone 130 N. Franklin’s Planned Development designation to a DC-3, nullifying the development’s zoning approval and effectively ending the project. Planned by Tishman Speyer, the tower was supposed to occupy the currently vacant parcel that was once home to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Building. After the initial design was approved in 2015, the Planned Development’s six-year sunset was avoided by receiving a one-year extension that pushed the expiration into 2022. At the end of 2022, the redesign Urbanize reported on would allow the Planned Development to last another year. Local firm Krueck Sexton Partners has been in charge of the project’s design all the way back to the original 2015 scheme, with this latest version looking to update the massing and improve the public realm at street level. With the 730-foot height still intact, the building’s massing was largely simplified, expressed as a rectangular volume clad in flat curtain wall panels.  The tower design featured a dramatic shift at the low-rise portion of the tower, which extends towards the south, creating a trapezoid volume with curved terraces hanging off the building. Going up the tower, terraces continue at every floor on the midrise section, and every other floor on the high-rise section. With the redesign set to expire within a couple months and no progress made towards construction, Alderman Reilly’s rezoning introduction is proactive in responding to the ultimate lapse of the Planned Development. If the zoning passes, the approvals will effectively be canceled and would require a new zoning process if the developer wanted to move forward with the project. ",The Loop,0.0
Merchandise Mart set to get new amenities and rebrand,"With the building rebranded as THE MART, Merchandise Mart is getting a fresh suite of tenant amenities as well as food and beverage retailers and lobby renovations. Owned and operated by Vornado Realty Trust, THE MART is an architectural icon and the largest privately held commercial building in the United States.  Designed by Gensler, the new updates will provide the future of office space to some of the country's most creative and forward-thinking companies. The highly visible transformation will honor and challenge the building's heritage and its existing Art Deco architecture to create an open and accessible meeting place, opening its doors as a marketplace of experiences, creativity, and ideas. With new spaces and amenities set to open this summer, the offerings include a revitalized approach to the South Lobby, one of the city's most iconic Art Deco interiors, that includes the installation of new lounge seating to create a warm and welcoming environment for the public, with furnishings sourced exclusively from design showrooms at THE MART. An extensive, centralized amenity experience on the second floor will feature a 23,000 square-foot health club with state-of-the-art equipment, studios offering a full range of classes, and a juice bar; an intimate tenant-exclusive speakeasy lounge overlooking the river; and a cluster of new curated retail offerings across beauty, health, and wellbeing. A 21,000 square-foot tenant-exclusive conference center and workspace with conference and meeting rooms, lounge areas, flexible programming space, and a private café, designed for quiet focused and productive collaboration will also be part of the new offerings. On the exterior, a reimagination of THE MART's River Park public space will include a plaza for pedestrian traffic and gathering, a lush central lawn for community celebrations and programming, al fresco seating activated by new food and beverage offerings, and a localized approach to landscaping that introduces foliage and perennials from the surrounding Chicago region. Designed by Hoerr Schaudt Landscape Architects, the new River Park is part of a larger approach to make privatized space public by bringing the rooftop amenities to the street level, creating a new front yard for Chicago and one of few dynamic spaces available to the public on the riverfront. The upcoming transformation follows an earlier phase of improvements to THE MART in 2016 that saw the introduction of the Grand Stair and Marshall's Landing, one of Chicago's top dining destinations, and a new Food Hall with robust and varied offerings, as well as a new reception and information desk.

City announces two more LaSalle Reimagined winners,"The City of Chicago has announced the advancement of two additional office-to-residential conversion projects to the next stage of the review process as part of LaSalle Street Reimagined. “As LaSalle Street continues to evolve as one of the most distinguished and storied corridors in the Midwest, these conversions reaffirm the City’s support for innovative projects and improvements that reinforce its economic vitality for all Chicagoans,” Mayor Lightfoot said.  With three proposals originally awarded back in March, the combined five adaptive reuse proposals would, if ultimately approved by the city, represent nearly $1 billion in investment along the corridor. Together the office to residential conversions would result in over 1,600 residential units, with more than 600 of them slated to be affordable. These conversions would also reduce upper-story commercial vacancies along the LaSalle corridor by nearly 50%. Check out below for details on the two latest projects:   30 N. LaSalle Planned by Golub & Company and AIG, the 44-story tower was originally built in 1974 and is only 46% leased with a contiguous 12 vacant floors in the bottom of the tower ready for reuse.  With SCB in charge of the design, the original plan would convert the lower 22 floors into 432 apartments. The revised scope trims the unit count from 432 down to 349, removing a few floors of units and eliminating the previous plan for adding a new elevator in the building. With 349 total units instead of 432, the affordable count of apartments is being cut from 130 down to 105.  Like before, the top 20 floors would remain as office space and a residential lobby will be added along W. Washington St. The existing office lobby, Amalgamated Bank retail space, and Starbucks retail space will remain in their current locations, while Einstein Bagels will move to the west side of the Washington St frontage to make space for the residential lobby. Residents will have access to 100 bike parking spaces and a dog run on the ground floor, as well as coworking space and a party room on the second floor.  The exterior of the building will be largely the same, except for the installation of new windows at the residential units. At the 11th floor, residents will benefit from a new projecting terrace that features a host of indoor/outdoor amenity spaces. The projecting terrace will be complemented with a resident lounge, party room, and fitness center on the interior of the 11th floor. Planning to expand and improve the streetscape, landscape architects Confluence have been tapped for a full redesign of the streetscape around the building. Down in cost from $173 million to $143 million, the developers have reduced their TIF ask from $75 million down to $62 million. The remaining cost will be covered with equity and debt. With empty floors and no landmark status, the development team is ready to start demolition immediately if chosen by the city. Construction would be set to begin in December 2023, with the first units being available at the beginning of 2025. -- The Clark Adams Renewal The second proposal now under consideration is for 105 W. Adams. Known as the Clark & Adams Building, it was designed by the Burnham Brothers and completed in 1927, standing 476 feet tall with 41 floors. Currently in receivership, the building is just 20% occupied and in poor physical condition. Planned by locally based Celadon Partners and Blackwood Group with DesignBridge on board as the architect, the developers plan to convert the building into 247 apartments, with 75% of them designated as affordable at 60% AMI. The 247 units will be split into 104 studios, 81 one-beds, 50 two-beds, and 12 three-beds. Residents will have access to 125 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. With 27,500 square feet of commercial space, the developers are targeting a grocery tenant to fill up the second floor of the building.  Above that, the existing Club Quarters Hotel occupies floors 3 through 10 and would remain unchanged and open as part of this plan. Floors 11 through 23 will be renovated to house the residential units, with the 24th floor set to host amenities for the new residents. With a full exterior and interior restoration planned, the only revision to this proposal is its cost, lowering the pierce tag from $188 million down to $178 million. Funding will include a lower TIF ask, penciling in at $57 million instead of the previous $60 million. The rest will be covered by equity, a first mortgage, City of Chicago capital, donation tax credit equity, and other grants. This project team is currently in discussions with the owner and would finish acquiring the building in July 2023, receive zoning approval by January 2024, begin construction April 2024, and complete the building by December 2025.

Preliminary landmark designation approved for Century & Consumers Buildings,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks yesterday approved a preliminary landmark designation for the Century and Consumers Buildings, but the structures aren’t safe yet. With $52 million in federal funds approved to demolish the towers, the GSA is citing security and safety reasons for the Dirksen Courthouse as reasoning to clear this corner of the Loop. After approving a resolution to formally review the buildings in July 2022, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks heard detailed reports from landmarks staff in September 2022 that the buildings were certainly of landmark status and eligibility. At the time, the commission stopped short of a vote, acknowledging the clearly established criteria for potential landmarking but also acknowledging the need for more time to get more information surrounding the perceived safety issues, so that a designation process would help rehab buildings in a way to provide reasonable and necessary security for the courthouse. Since then, the GSA has been going through the Section 106 process of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to define anticipated environmental impacts and accommodate historic preservation concerns through the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) process.  The GSA has retained architects to conduct condition assessments on all four buildings and draft reports are in the works. According to landmarks staff, they have been informed that the Century and Consumers Buildings appear to be structurally sound but have considerable exterior cladding issues. In between them, the building at 214 S. State appears to be structurally sound, but the structure at 208-212 S. State is in a condition that necessitates demolition. That building’s original 1920’s facade was removed in a 1950’s facade remodel that was then also replaced by a 1990’s remodel. The GSA has blocked the sidewalks off and plans to demolish the structure this month. Additional work on the site includes the removal of the fire escapes on the remaining three buildings and the removal of portions of the terracotta parapets which will be stored in coordination with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) Built in 1915-16, the Century Building at 202 S. State is a strong example of an early 20th century commercial style building which was essentially an early urban mall, with shops on multiple levels where customers would pass through and shop. Designed by Holabird & Roche, the tower is designed with the fundamentals of the Chicago School with technological advancements that allowed for taller buildings with more glass and windows. The tower’s overall slenderness, narrow mullions, and recessed spandrel panels gave a sense of verticality to the building that was accentuated with its white glazed terracotta cladding.  The landmark designation will identify significant features of the Century Building as all exterior elevations including rooflines as well as the first and second floor exterior which exhibits the 1950’s remodel in the International Style. Due to the adjacency to the Dirksen Courthouse and the GSA’s required reuse criteria, the designation would allow for flexibility in allowing building modifications so that a viable reuse could meet all 15 required criteria set forth by the GSA. Built just a few years earlier, the Consumers Building was completed in 1913 by developer Jacob L. Kesner, with Mundie and Jensen as the architects. Located at 220 S. State, the tower was built as a professional office building with extensive retail space on the lower floors. Also built in the commercial style with the tradition of Chicago School, the building’s steel frame is expressed by a more solid grid-like pattern of narrow, vertical piers and horizontal spandrel bands. The building also retains its lavish interior lobby, with Carrera marble on the walls and ceilings with classical revival detailing. A marble staircase sits in an alcove while the space is adorned with decorative bronze fixtures.  The landmark designation will identify significant features of the Consumers Building as all exterior elevations including rooflines as well as the main entrance vestibule and elevator lobby, the lobby staircase to the second floor, and the barrel-vaulted staircase to the basement including marble finishes at walls and ceilings. Due to the adjacency to the Dirksen Courthouse and the GSA’s required reuse criteria, the designation would allow for flexibility in allowing building modifications so that a viable reuse could meet all 15 required criteria set forth by the GSA. With the GSA continuing the Section 106 process throughout the rest of the year, they plan to publish the Draft Environmental Impact Statement this month, with an estimated cost of rehabilitation set to be released in May. After the process progresses through the year, the final Record of Decision will be announced in February 2024. While the city can proceed with landmarking the structures, the federal government can ultimately decide to still demolish the buildings due to the fact that federal power overrules local ordinances.  -- As a refresher, here are the three official options that would be chosen from for the final decision and the list of 15 criteria required to warrant a ‘viable’ reuse. Alternative A: Demolition - GSA is considering the demolition of four buildings at 202, 208, 214, and 220 S. State. Funds appropriated by Congress are only available for demolition, securing the site, and landscaping the site after demolition has been completed.  Alternative B: Viable Adaptive Reuse - The GSA would consider a viable adaptive reuse of the four buildings contingent on meeting a set of restrictions that are necessary to meet the security needs of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. No federal funds are available for rehabilitation, preservation, or restoration of the buildings. The 15 criteria are as follows: Alternative C: No Action - GSA would continue with the status quo, leaving the buildings vacant with significant repairs needed. Limited federal funding would be available for any future maintenance. ",The Loop,0.0
Three proposals win funding for LaSalle Reimagined,"The City of Chicago has announced three finalists to get city funding through the LaSalle Reimagined initiative. ""Today's announcement represents the culmination of months of work by the Mayor's Office to solicit, review, and identify IFP submissions that will reimagine LaSalle Street,"" Mayor Lightfoot said.  According to the city, each finalist meets the IFP’s objectives to revitalize an underperforming historic property, provide 30% of the total housing units at affordable levels, and create neighborhood-oriented building amenities that contribute to a dynamic, mixed-use, downtown environment. There are presently no affordable apartments on or near LaSalle within the Loop.   Planned for 1.6 million square feet of space, the winning developments include:     The Monroe Residences & Hotel at 111 W. Monroe Planned by Prime/Capri Interests, LLC, which is a joint venture of affiliates of The Prime Group, Inc. and Capri Investment Group, the upper floors of the building will be converted into 349 apartments, with a mix of 182 studios, 125 one-beds, and 42 two-beds. 105 of these will be set aside as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. On the ground floor, hotel guests will enter through the historic lobby off of W. Monroe St, with the residential entry located adjacent to the hotel entrance. A new fine dining restaurant is planned for the lobby at the corner of N. LaSalle St and W. Monroe St. 130 parking spaces will be built underground for residents. With Stantec on board for the design, the project will carve out a 60 foot by 70-foot atrium to allow for natural light to reach the new apartments and hotel rooms without altering any street-facing facades. At the middle of the building, two floors will be turned into a world-class spa and fitness center with an indoor pool, golf simulator, and fitness center. The roof level will be reactivated by reopening the original Monroe Club as an amenity for residents and hotel guests. The former mechanical penthouse will become a restaurant, with the outdoor deck including a pool.  Set to cost $180 million, the project would be funded with $18 million in sponsor equity, $40 million in TIF funding, $14 million LIHTC equity, $20 million historic tax credits, and $88 million in tax-exempt housing bonds. The team could begin construction in 12 months, with a 26-month construction timeline. First units would become available in early 2026, with full occupancy set for Summer 2026. A separate, 226-key hotel project would proceed simultaneously within the building’s lower floors.   -- The Field Building at 135 S. LaSalle  Proposed by Riverside Investment and Development and AmTrustRE, the project would convert 750,000 square feet of empty space into 430 residential units, split into 254 studios, 116 one-beds, and 60 two-beds. With 30%, or 129, of them set aside as affordable, the residential component would be complemented by 80,000 square feet of retail space at the base of the building.  On the ground floor, residential lobbies will be located at S. LaSalle St and S. Clark St, north of the historic main arcade, with retail space occupying the south side of the building fronting W. Adams St. The development team is targeting a grocery tenant to take about 15,000-25,000 square feet of the retail space. Above the retail space, floors three and four would hold 180 parking spaces hidden by new interior walls setback from the exterior windows.  With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board as the architect, the building will receive a full restoration of the facade, restoration of the arcades at the base of the building, and windows will be replaced. Vinci Hamp Architects will be consulting on the historic portions of the redesign.  Set to cost $258 million, the project would be funded with $115 million in TIF, $34 million in Historic Tax Credits, $30 million from a sponsor/3rd party, and $78 million in debt. With the proposal moving forward, design would take 9-12 months, then construction would begin in 2024, with the building opening to residents in Q1 2025. -- The LaSalle Residences at 208 S. LaSalle Planned by The Prime Group, the proposal will convert the middle chunk of floors into 280 residential units. With Lamar Johnson Collaborative and Lucien LaGrange Studio working on the project, floors 13 through 17 will be the ones renovated as part of this proposal. Set to produce 280 apartments, 30% of them will be set aside as affordable. The mix includes 111 studios, 120 one-beds, and 49 two-beds. On the ground floor, residents will enter through a lobby facing S. LaSalle St, sharing with the new hotel. A dog run and dog spa will be included, with a bike storage room also included.  Originally acquired in 1996, The Prime Group has already converted the lower 12 floors into a JW Marriott Hotel and just opened floors 18-22 as The LaSalle Hotel with 232 keys. The building was Burnham’s last design before he died, built in 1914 for the Continental and Commercial National Bank. Set to cost $130 million, the rehab would be funded by $74 million in tax-exempt housing bonds, $10 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits, $33 million in TIF funding, and just $13 million in sponsor equity. Since The Prime Group already owns the building, they would look to start construction by the end of 2023. With W.E. O’Neil on board for construction, the team expects an 18–20-month construction timeline, with first units set to open Summer 2025. -- The nine proposals were evaluated for alignment with the IFP goals, potential catalytic impact and economic feasibility, among other criteria, including efforts to exceed minimum diversity requirements for construction teams.   The selected finalists will proceed to the next phase of the City's standard review, underwriting, and approval processes, including evaluations by the Community Development Commission, Commission on Chicago Landmarks and City Council. TIF requests are tentative until approved by the City Council.   Given the IFP’s success and stakeholder interest in a more equitable and resilient downtown, DPD and DOH are making additional LaSalle Central TIF funding available for adaptive reuse projects that provide 30% housing affordability at an average 60% AMI, offer new neighborhood-oriented public amenities, and exceed City minimums for minority and women-owned participation, among other requirements.   ",The Loop,1.0
LaSalle Reimagined: 105 W. Adams,"With six finalists for the LaSalle Reimagined presenting their plans to the community, Urbanize is breaking it down by proposal to highlight the design and benefits of each one as the city considers which three to name as winners.  Plagued with vacancies, the corridor is littered with empty historic office buildings that no longer meet the current market demands of new office tenants. Originally announced at the end of September 2022, Mayor Lightfoot and the Department of Planning and Development are offering city funding for proposals along the LaSalle Street corridor. Public resources are expected to include federal tax credits, Cook County property tax incentives, TIF funding, PACE financing, Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tools. With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. The final building under consideration is unique in that it has two developers vying for the chance to redevelop it. Located at 105 W. Adams, the Clark & Adams Building was designed by the Burnham Brothers and completed in 1927, standing 476 feet tall with 41 floors. Currently in receivership, the building is just 20% occupied and in poor physical condition.   The Clark Adams Renewal The first proposal comes from the partnership of locally-based Celadon Partners and Blackwood Group. With DesignBridge on board as the architect, the developers plan to convert the building into 247 apartments, with 75% of them designated as affordable at 60% AMI. The 247 units will be split into 104 studios, 81 one-beds, 50 two-beds, and 12 three-beds. Residents will have access to 125 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. With 27,500 square feet of commercial space, the developers are targeting a grocery tenant to fill up the second floor of the building.  Above that, the existing Club Quarters Hotel occupies floors 3 through 10 and would remain unchanged and open as part of this plan. Floors 11 through 23 will be renovated to house the residential units, with the 24th floor set to host amenities for the new residents. With a full exterior and interior restoration planned, the project cost is expected to total $188 million. Funding will include $77.7 million in tax credit equity, $25 million from a first mortgage, $60 million in TIF, $15 million from City of Chicago capital, $8 million donation tax credit equity, $1 million in other grants, and just $900,000 in owner equity. This project team is currently in discussions with the owner and would finish acquiring the building in July 2023, receive zoning approval by January 2024, begin construction April 2024, and complete the building by December 2025. -- 105 W. Adams - Maven The second proposal comes from Maven Development Group who would be collaborating with 5T Management, 33 Realty, and Cogent Management Group on the project. Their proposal would convert 333,000 square feet of space in the building into 423 apartments, with 127 of them set aside as affordable at 60% AMI. The available commercial space on the second floor would be targeted for a grocery tenant as well as other smaller food establishments and retailers on the ground floor. With FitzGerald in charge of the design, the unit mix will consist of 46 affordable studios, 50 affordable one-beds, 31 affordable two-beds, 107 market-rate studios, 117 market-rate one-beds, and 72 market-rate two-beds. The 24th floor would be designed as an amenity floor for tenants with outdoor space being located on the roofs of the lower floors. Set to cost $167 million, the project would be funded with $19.2 million in equity, $18.2 million in historic tax credit equity, $14.5 million in a federal bridge loan, $64.7 million from a construction loan, and $65 million in TIF funding. If selected, the developer will close on the acquisition of the building in the coming months and go through a full Planned Development process with the city. With W.E. O’Neil and GMA Construction Group on board, work would begin Late 2024 and is targeted for completion in 2026. -- The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing. Once that decision is made by the end of month, the city will go through an underwriting process that will take a few months. The proposals will then need approval from the Community Development Commission and City Council for the appropriation of the city funding.  ",The Loop,1.0

With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. Located at 135 S. LaSalle, the Field Building is set to be converted into a new mixed-use hub along the corridor. Proposed by Riverside Investment and Development and AmTrustRE, the 1934 tower currently holds 1.2 million square feet and is a city landmark. With the departure of Bank of America in 2020, the building has 900,000 square feet of empty space ready to be repurposed. With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board as the architect, the building will receive a full restoration of the facade, restoration of the arcades at the base of the building, and windows will be replaced. Vinci Hamp Architects will be consulting on the historic portions of the redesign.  The planned rehab is limited to floors 15 and below, which will be reactivated with 430 residential units and 80,000 square feet of retail space on the first two floors. New residential lobbies will be located at S. LaSalle St and S. Clark St, north of the historic main arcade that runs through the ground floor. The beginning of the retail space will be on the south side of the arcade fronting W. Adams St. The second floor spans 30,000 square feet and was vacated by Bank of America, offering a large space that could become an event space or could house a potential grocer. The original banking hall space has unique features including 16-foot ceilings and a 7,000 square foot area of column-free space. Teaming up with Bluestar Properties for the retail programming, the development team is targeting a grocery tenant to take about 15,000-25,000 square feet of the retail space.  Above the retail space, floors three and four would be converted into 180 parking spaces. With plans to set the spaces back from the windows with walls to hide the cars from the public view, these spaces are deemed vital to the leasing efforts of the retail space especially for attracting a grocery tenant. These parking spaces would be shared with residents, who would also have access to 400+ bike parking spaces. On the residential floors, the original building's layout is no longer conducive to office use but is very well suited to a residential layout. Measuring 40,000 square feet, the floor plate’s quadrant layout allows for an abundance of light and air even in the urban core. These floors will hold 254 studios, 116 one-beds, and 60 two-beds, with 30%, or 129, of them set aside as affordable. Set to cost $258 million, the project would be funded with $115 million in TIF, $34 million in Historic Tax Credits, $30 million from a sponsor/3rd party, and $78 million in debt. With no leasing encumbrances, this is a shovel-ready project. If selected, design would take 9-12 months, then construction would begin in 2024, with the building opening to residents in Q1 2025. The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing.

With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. Proposed at 111 W. Monroe, The Monroe Residences and Hotel would create a mixed-use building in the heart of the LaSalle Street corridor. Planned by Prime/Capri Interests, LLC, which is a joint venture of affiliates of The Prime Group, Inc. and Capri Investment Group, the team acquired the building from BMO last summer. Consisting of three towers, the proposal will rehab two of them, with the third tower at 115 S. LaSalle set to hold the state workers moved from the Thompson Center, another development from Prime/Capri Interests, LLC. With Stantec on board for the design, the building will be converted into a mixed-use building, set to include 349 apartments, 226 hotel keys, and meeting/event space on the second floor. The roof level will be reactivated by reopening the original Monroe Club as an amenity for residents and hotel guests. The former mechanical penthouse will become a restaurant, with the outdoor deck including a pool.  To allow for natural light to reach the new apartments and hotel rooms, the plan would carve out a 60 foot by 70-foot atrium inside the building to avoid altering any street-facing facades. At the middle of the building, two floors will be turned into a world-class spa and fitness center with an indoor pool, golf simulator, and fitness center.  Set to build 349 apartments, the units will be a mix of 182 studios, 125 one-beds, and 42 two-beds. 105 of these will be set aside as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. On the ground floor, hotel guests will enter through the historic lobby off of W. Monroe St, with the residential entry located adjacent to the hotel entrance. A new fine dining restaurant is planned for the lobby at the corner of N. LaSalle St and W. Monroe St. 130 parking spaces will be built underground for residents. Set to cost $295 million, the proposal would be funded with $48 million in sponsor equity, $40 million in TIF funding, $14 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits, $35 million in Historic Tax Credits, $20 million in PACE Energy Bonds, $88 million in tax-exempt housing bonds, and $50 million from a senior construction loan.  With the building already under the ownership of Prime/Capri Interests, LLC, the team would be in a position to move forward immediately if selected. BMO has largely moved out of the building already, with only a few floors still occupied that are set to vacate soon, leaving the building free and clear of tenants. The team could begin construction in 12 months, with a 26-month construction timeline. First units would become available in early 2026, with full occupancy set for Summer 2026. The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing.

With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. Planned by Golub and Co, the first proposal is at 30 N. LaSalle. Currently in receivership, Corebridge Financial will be getting the title to the building and collaborating with Golub on the project. Originally built in 1974, the 44-story tower is only 46% leased with a contiguous 12 vacant floors in the bottom of the tower ready for reuse.  With SCB in charge of the design, the plan would convert the lower 22 floors into 432 apartments. While 440,000 square feet of space in the bottom of the tower would be converted into residential, the top 20 floors would remain as office space. To allow for the addition of residential use, a residential lobby will be added along W. Washington St. The existing office lobby, Amalgamated Bank retail space, and Starbucks retail space will remain in their current locations, while Einstein Bagels will move to the west side of the Washington St frontage to make space for the residential lobby. With 432 new apartments in the building, units will be split into 252 studios, 126 one-beds, and 54 two-beds. As part of the project, 30%, or 130 of those units, will be set aside as affordable up to 60% AMI. Residents will have access to 100 bike parking spaces and a dog run on the ground floor, as well as coworking space and a party room on the second floor.  The exterior of the building will be largely the same, except for the installation of new windows at the residential units. At the 11th floor, residents will benefit from a new projecting terrace that features a host of indoor/outdoor amenity spaces. The projecting terrace will be complemented with a resident lounge, party room, and fitness center on the interior of the 11th floor.  Planning to expand and improve the streetscape, landscape architects Confluence have been tapped for a full redesign of the streetscape around the building. At the southwest corner of W. Washington St and N. LaSalle St, the streetscape will be redesigned with new landscaping, hardscaping, and public art. Set to cost $173 million, the developers plan to fund the project with $53.6 million in equity, $44 million in debt, and are asking the city to chip in $75 million in TIF funding. With empty floors and no landmark status, the development team is ready to start demolition immediately if chosen by the city. Construction would be set to begin in December 2023, with the first units being available at the beginning of 2025. The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing.

Lightfoot joins alders to introduce Safe Streets Pilot,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot joined Aldermen Hopkins, La Spata, Martin, Reilly, and Vasquez to introduce to City Council a new measure that aims to improve traffic safety, enhance protections for pedestrians and bicyclists, and speed up public transportation.  The Smart Streets Pilots Ordinance would establish two small-scale pilots downtown that use existing infrastructure and new technology to enforce parking violations, such as cars parked in bike lanes, bus-only lanes, bus stops, and crosswalks, and enable camera enforcement for parking in commercial loading zones.  “As traffic fatalities have risen at an alarming rate both locally and nationally in recent years, it is critically important that Chicago use every tool available to improve safety for all road users,” said Chicago Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot. “That’s why we are proud to introduce an ordinance that will enable two pilots downtown to create safer streets and a better transit experience. By testing a small-scale pilot in 2023, the city will be better able to evaluate how these initiatives will work best when implemented on a citywide scale.”  Traffic fatalities have risen sharply in Chicago and in many other large cities since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Chicago’s annual fatalities in 2021 more than 50% higher than in 2019. In 2021 alone, more than 170 people were killed in traffic crashes in Chicago.  The Smart Streets Ordinance will encourage safer driver behavior and better parking compliance with the goal of reducing crashes and creating safer streets. The ordinance would establish two two-year pilot programs within the boundaries of Lake Michigan to Ashland Avenue and from North Avenue to Roosevelt.  Smart Streets Pilot  This first pilot would authorize the city to ticket registered vehicle owners by mail for various infractions, including parking in bike lanes, bus-only lanes, crosswalks, bus stops, and no parking zones. This pilot would discourage drivers from illegally parking in places that put our most vulnerable road users — people walking, biking, rolling, and taking transit — in dangerous situations, such as forcing bicyclists to merge with motor vehicle traffic.  This pilot would also promote a more reliable, efficient, and accessible bus service by deterring drivers from parking in bus-only lanes or at designated bus stops. Chicago’s growing bus priority network is key to combating congestion, providing equitable rapid transit, and lowering emissions. Free-flowing bus lanes without illegally parked or idling cars will improve rider experience and operational performance of Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Additionally, parked cars at bus stops create challenges and sometimes hazardous conditions for riders with disabilities when buses are blocked from accessing the curb.  The ordinance allows for cameras to be fixed on city poles or on the front of city or CTA vehicles. Once data is collected, it will be individually reviewed and then sent to the Department of Finance (DOF) to be processed. When the city begins camera enforcement of parking or standing violations in areas with posted signs, the ordinance proposes a 30-day warning period for first-time violators, and anyone ticketed within 30 days of the installation of a new camera.  Through the Clear Path Relief program, low-income drivers will continue to be eligible for reduced-priced tickets and other vehicle related debt relief.  Smart Loading Zone Pilot  This second pilot would use license plate reading camera technology to facilitate more efficient driver or company payment and to enforce parking violations within commercial loading zones designed for the loading and unloading of commercial vehicles. The pilot aims to prevent double-parking that puts drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians in unsafe conditions, decrease vehicle idling and reduce emissions, and create a more efficient system for payment and drop-offs for commercial drivers.  The introduction of this ordinance builds on actions by the Lightfoot Administration to keep Chicago’s streets safe through infrastructure investments and design. In 2022, CDOT implemented pedestrian safety improvements at approximately 400 intersections, including bump outs, curb extensions, and refuge islands. CDOT continued to expand and improve Chicago’s bikeway network, adding nearly 40 miles in 2022 and surpassing 100 miles added since Mayor Lightfoot took office. Last year, CDOT began a new program to upgrade all existing plastic-protected lanes to concrete curbs to provide increased safety for all road users.  ",The Loop,0.0
Park District looks to revamp Grant Park framework,"The Chicago Park District opened their community engagement process for the revamp of the Grant Park Framework Plan. Dubbed ‘Chicago’s Front Yard Reimagined’ the effort looks to revisit and update the 2002 Grant Park Framework Plan that is now over 20 years old. Dating back to 1835, Grant Park was originally made to preserve green space from the rapid development occurring in the city. Assembling a large team, the Chicago Park District has brought on UrbanWorks, APMonarch, Confluence, Brush Architects, WSSCG, and Engage Civil. Tasked with creating a comprehensive vision, the new framework plan will outline short- and long-term goals while creating a guide to evaluate future proposals and ideas. This vision will focus on the next 20 years after the previous plan reshaped Grant Park in the last 20 years.  The overall project has four phases. Already complete, the first phase lasted from March until June 2022, working on site verification and program analysis. Currently in Phase 2, this phase is the public engagement portion, beginning back in July 2022 and lasting until July 2023. While public feedback is being received, Phase 3 will begin this month. Lasting until August 2023, this phase will be the design and plan development portion of the project. After Phase 3, the project will be finalized between September 2023 and December 2023, where the final framework plan and report document will be drafted and implemented.  Presenting to the community yesterday, the meeting was the kickoff for the public engagement process of the overall framework plan revamp. While this is the beginning of open public engagement, the Chicago Park District has already been working with a group of stakeholders to identify early priorities. Overall themes from the stakeholder engagement have been preservation and landscape, recreation, events, safety and logistics, and mobility. In the realm of preservation and landscape, common themes include making accessibility accommodations to the park’s historic elements, as well as making accommodations for all of the surrounding residents by adding a playground at the south end of the park and a dog park at the north end of the park.  For recreation, stakeholders have been interested in the park adjusting to current demands by skewing toward pickleball and soccer vs softball, for example. They would like to create more safe and effective spaces to accommodate activities that cater to seniors, while also helping children get involved with public art. Overall, the stakeholders expressed an interest in encouraging visitors of all ages from outside of the immediate area to come to the park.  In regard to events, stakeholders have given suggestions for improvements for events including dedicated staging areas, a system of secondary/service vehicle circulation (including golf carts), infrastructure for temporary stages, and barricade beautification. There have been shared values around minimizing restricted access to the park, keeping the park beautiful during events, “leaving no trace”, and respecting neighboring residents, businesses and institutions. For mobility, there has been the sense that once visitors reach the park, movement is mostly via bikes and walking which can limit access and exploration for certain groups such as families and seniors. Other means of transportation, such as more Divvy stations throughout, people movers, designated golf carts, and free shuttle paths were suggested.   The final theme was safety, where stakeholders brought up the idea that safety and security concerns should not target any specific groups. There was also discussion around the priority that should be given to addressing traffic concerns on Columbus Dr, Lake Shore Drive, and midblock pedestrian crossings at E. Balbo Dr, E. Monroe St, and E. Jackson Dr, with solutions such as speed tables, striped crossings, curb extensions, and limiting the use of those roads. The next steps for the project include three in-person public meetings that will happen this month and into February. After that, the framework will undergo design work before presenting the initial concept design to both stakeholders and another community meeting. After that, the plan will be finalized, presented once again, and finally implemented. ",The Loop,0.0
"Developers propose 2,000 units for LaSalle Street Reimagined","Developers have answered the call for proposals to reimagine the Loop’s LaSalle Street corridor as a new mixed-use district. Plagued with vacancies, the corridor is littered with empty historic office buildings that no longer meet the current market demands of new office tenants. Originally announced at the end of September, Mayor Lightfoot and the Department of Planning and Development identified the bounds of eligible buildings to be those along LaSalle St, stretching from W. Washington St down to W. Van Buren St. While all of these projects would be developed privately, the initiative is offering up an array of public resources to help finance the conversions. Those resources are expected to include federal tax credits, Cook County property tax incentives, Tax Increment Financing, PACE financing, Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tools, subject to the review and approval of relevant public agencies and the Chicago City Council. With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support.   With seven buildings and nine competing proposals, the potential investment lands near $1.2 billion and just over 2,000 units. Here are the proposals broken down by building: 400 S. LaSalle Starting at the south end of the corridor, developer Urban Resolve has proposed to convert the six-story structure into 226 beds of student housing along with a food court, fitness center, and a mental health center. Formerly the CBOE Global Markets headquarters, the $104 million conversion will also include an esports arena. -- 208 S. LaSalle Heading up the block is 208 S. LaSalle, which already had office floors converted into hotels, including a JW Marriott and The LaSalle. Led by The Prime Group, the latest plan would convert a portion of the upper floors into 84 apartments. Set to cost $130 million, the new residences would be served by a dog run, fitness center, lounge, and access to the hotel amenities.  However, a competing proposal has also been submitted for the same space. A cooperation between Sims Property Development & Management and Brinshore Development would create 102 apartments in their $50.2 million proposal. -- 135 S. LaSalle As the former home of Bank of America, Chicago’s Riverside Investment & Development is looking to convert the entire 44-story building into 430 apartments. Set to run $258 million the venture would be a partnership with Blue Star Properties and the building’s owner AmTrust. The base of the building would become home to up to 80,000 square feet of lobby, retail, restaurant, event, and cultural space. This site has been eyed for a potential grocery store, something the area is severely lacking.  -- 105 W. Adams Also known as the Clark-Adams Building, the 1927 tower has been eyed by Maven Development Group for 432 apartments on the upper 31 floors. Spending $167 million, this plan would not include the lower 10 floors which are currently home to a Club Quarters Hotel and Elephant & Castle Pub. Overlooking Federal Plaza to the east, the structure is lucky enough to be one of the two buildings with competing proposals. Coming from Blackwood Group and Celadon Partners, this alternate concept would spend $192 million converting the empty space into 185 units, with a two-level food market and a Stockyards Coffee House at the base.   -- 111 W. Monroe Overlooking the corner of W. Monroe St and S. Clark St, developers Prime Group and Capri Capital Partners are seeking to create 349 apartments with 105 of them set aside as affordable. Previously the headquarters of BMO, the 1974 structure would also see the addition of a hotel on the lower seven floors, plus a spa, rooftop pool, and restaurant all adding up to a $180 million conversion. -- 30 N. LaSalle With the building’s owner AmTrust currently going through a foreclosure suit on the property, developers Golub & Co. and investor American General Life Insurance are looking to convert the 43-story tower into 432 apartments. Set to run them $186 million, the building would have new ground-floor retail space as well as green spaces and seating along its street frontages. -- 170 W. Washington Ending our breakdown at the northern end of the district, this final proposal also happens to be the smallest. Building owners, restaurateurs, and businessmen Scott Cochrane, Kevin Killerman, and Carmen Rossi are looking to convert the building into four apartments with new ground-floor retail and commercial spaces, with them likely including a restaurant of their own. Built in 1930, the plan to convert the five-story building is expected to cost about $2 million. -- With these nine proposals submitted, the city will now review them to determine their feasibility and to decide how much TIF funding, if any, they will allot. Currently, the LaSalle Central TIF district is reported to have $197 million in funds available. The city plans to announce the first winners in a few months and construction could commence as soon as 2024. ",The Loop,1.0
Covent Hotel redevelopment celebrates ribbon cutting,"The NHP Foundation recently celebrated the reopening of the Covent Apartments, the company’s latest SRO development. Located at 2653 N. Clark, the project rehabbed the existing Covent Hotel building into 30 small affordable studio apartments. ""Being able to restore this extraordinary space and provide the only permanent supportive housing in Lincoln Park enables individuals in the most dire circumstances to have an affordable home,"" said Covent lead developer Veronica Gonzalez, ""And with the support of our public and private partners here with us today, we prevent displacement from a higher end, upscale community and maintain the character of the community. We congratulate our tax credit investor R4 Capital, and our lender Merchants Capital for their partnership in completing this important project."" Designed by Weese Langley Weese Architects, the historic building will front N. Clark St with 4,700 square feet of retail space and a new residential lobby. Residents will have access to an on-site laundry room, a community room, and outdoor space. The building will have no parking spaces. With a total development cost of $21.6 million, the developer funded the project with $7.9 million in federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and Historic Tax Credits, $5 million of City Home and Affordable Housing Opportunity Funds, $3.1 million in IHDA Permanent Supportive Housing Funds, and $4.9 million of a HUD/FHA 220 loan. The project also received a $698,910 Affordable Housing Program (""AHP"") General Fund grant from FHLBank Chicago. Linn-Mathes was the general contractor leading construction of the development.

Urbanize tours 935 W. Webster,"Urbanize recently toured the construction site of 935 W. Webster, a mixed-use development in Lincoln Park. Planned by Mavrek Development and GW Properties, the property was formerly home to State Restaurant at the southwest corner of W. Webster Ave and N. Bissell St. Starting on the ground floor, the development retained the outside brick walls of the existing one-story building and were painted white. The interior was demolished starting back in March, with a new steel structure built up for the apartments above. With two retail spaces in the building, the western space is leased to Sushi Taku while the corner retail space is still available for lease. Both spaces are enclosed but sit raw awaiting the buildout of the upcoming retailers. The back of the ground floor will include two parking spaces for residents and a bike storage room. Heading up to the apartments, we started with the first two units which are accessed from N. Bissell St. With a total of four units, all of them will be four-bedroom, two-bath configurations. The unique two-floor design brings 20-foot ceilings into the units' common spaces with two bedrooms and one bathroom per floor in the apartments. Flooring and drywall have been installed in the apartments and they are awaiting cabinetry installation before final finishes are installed.  Our next stop was the second set of units, which are accessed from W. Webster Ave. The two units are completed to a similar point, awaiting cabinetry and finishes. Stepping outside, each apartment will have an outdoor deck facing west towards the L tracks. Once completed, the patios will be enclosed with fencing and ivy will be added for additional privacy. On the way out, our final stop was the newly painted mural on the west elevation of the building underneath the L tracks. Construction on the building will wrap up at the end of January 2024 with leasing starting in the New Year. Mavrek is serving as the general contractor with 360 Design Studio serving as the architect. ",Lincoln Park,0.0
DePaul University gets permit to renovate Sullivan Athletic Center,"DePaul University has received permits to renovate the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena at 2323 N. Sheffield. As part of a larger athletics investment, the school is also looking to build a new practice facility for the school’s basketball teams.  Designed by Antunovich Associates and HNTB, the renovation will infill one of the three basketball courts with two stories of new athletic support space. The first floor of the facility will be dedicated to the health and wellness of all 215+ DePaul student athletes, and will include a team dining space, nutrition bar, new sports medicine treatment spaces and offices, hydrotherapy, a weight room, and multi-purpose meeting rooms. Across the street, the school is planning to clear the site of a series of vintage buildings to build a new basketball practice facility. The new facility would feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. DePaul men’s and women’s basketball will move their training, practices, and operations into the building to allow for more dedicated spaces to support the programs.  With the permits issued for renovation, general contractor Bulley & Andrews can begin work inside the building. Work is set to begin this December, with the first phase being completed in late Summer 2024.  As the project moves forward, the demolition of buildings on the site across the street would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest as the proposal is seeking an amendment to the existing Planned Development for the campus. The amendment would need approval from Alderman Timmy Knudsen (43rd), the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council. Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026.  ",Lincoln Park,0.0
DePaul University presents basketball practice facility to community,"DePaul University has presented their plans to renovate the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena as well as to build a new practice facility for the school’s basketball teams. Planned for the northwest corner of W. Belden Ave and N. Sheffield Ave, the new facility will rise across the street from the current Sullivan Athletic Center and will replace a recently acquired, university-owned apartment complex in addition to four other smaller buildings in this area that are from the 1890s and 1920s. At the community meeting, DeWayne Peevy, DePaul’s Vice President and Director of Athletics, walked the community through their current facilities and its shortcomings. Peevy discussed how the current state of disrepair is hindering the school’s ability to recruit and retain top talent, with student athletes opting for other schools with better training programs and facilities. He told community members how this facilities investment was an opportunity for change and to build the national recognition and relevance of DePaul University. Designed by HNTB and Antunovich Associates, the new facility would feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. DePaul men’s and women’s basketball will move their training, practices, and operations across the street from the Sullivan Athletics Center to allow for more dedicated spaces to support the programs.  At the McGrath-Phillips Arena, the renovation will infill one of the three basketball courts with two stories of new athletic support space. The first floor of the facility will be dedicated to the health and wellness of all 215+ DePaul student athletes, and will include a team dining space, nutrition bar, new sports medicine treatment spaces and offices, hydrotherapy, a weight room, and multi-purpose meeting rooms. Set to cost $60 million, the project will be funded primarily through donor gifts and via a fundraising campaign. As the project moves forward, the demolition of buildings on site would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest as the proposal is seeking an amendment to the existing Planned Development for the campus. The amendment would need approval from Alderman Timmy Knudsen (43rd), the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council.  Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026. Renovation of the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena is set to begin this December, with the first phase being completed in late Summer 2024. At the meeting, neighbors expressed concern and disappointment with the plan to demolish the century-old buildings, citing the loss of character within the neighborhood and the loss of student housing. Richard Wiltse, Vice President of Facility Operations at DePaul explained that, while the demolitions will result in the loss of 40 beds of student housing, the school has seen an enrollment decline and there are currently 79 unoccupied beds in student housing. A number of residents made comments and asked about building the facility on other parcels owned by DePaul, including the large parking lot at the northwest corner of W. Fullerton Ave and N. Sheffield Ave or the building at the southeast corner of the same intersection which used to house the Whole Foods. Peter Coffey, Associate Vice President of Community and Government Relations explained that those properties are already master planned, and the university is not willing to give up those redevelopment opportunities which include a potential mixed-use development on the existing surface parking lot with student housing, a hotel, conference center, and parking.  When neighbors suggested replacing the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena, DeWayne Peevy jumped in to explain how it would be impossible to decommission their only athletic space in the interim while construction would be underway.  ",Lincoln Park,0.0

Rezoning proposed for three-flat at 2515 N. Clybourn,"A zoning application has been submitted for a residential development at 2515 N. Clybourn. Planned by owner Sean Gibbons, the project site is a narrow parcel just off of the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and W. Terra Cotta Pl. With Jonathan Splitt Architects leading the design, the new construction will be a three-story masonry building with basement. With three residential units, the basement simplex will have two bedrooms, the first-floor simplex unit will have two bedrooms, and the top two floors will have a three-bedroom duplex apartment. The building will have balconies on the first through third floors and residents will have access to three parking spaces at the back of the property. To allow for the scope of the development, the site will need to be rezoned from M1-2 to RM-4.5. Alderman Waguespack will need to approve the rezoning before it heads to City Hall for approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. ",Lincoln Park,0.0
Sterling Bay presents 1840 N. Marcey to the community,"Sterling Bay has presented their proposal for two mixed-use towers at 1840 N. Marcey. Located near Lincoln Yards, the project site is across the street from the former General Iron site. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the property is a long, rectangular site bound by N. Clifton Ave to the north, N. Kingsbury St to the west, N. Marcey St to the east, and W. Wisconsin St to the south.   Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the project’s design inspiration is based on the industrial history of the area, the Chicago city grid, and the rippling effect of water. The building massings began with a contextual base surrounded by open space, with stepped building masses that were extruded from the bases. The towers were offset to optimize sunlight for active terraces and to create better views for each building. Rising 215 feet, the southern building will be a 16-story tower with 308 residential units. The building will have 98 parking spaces all located on one level of underground parking as well as 308 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. The building’s ground floor features retail at the south end; a fitness center, lounge, and residential lobby at the center overlooking the green space; and leasing offices and the bike room at the north end.  Set to reach 325 feet tall, the 26-story northern building will have 300 rental units and 262 parking spaces, with 55 of them below-grade. Residents will also have access to 300 bike parking spaces. The building’s ground floor will be made up of a significant amount of retail, occupying the entire north and west frontage, only interrupted by the parking access along N. Kingsbury St. The building’s lobby will face south towards the green space, with more retail at the southeast corner.  The two buildings are separated on the site with an internal vehicle driveway and turnaround for drop off and parking access for the southern building. Around the site, the development will widen the sidewalks and stamped crosswalks with improved ADA ramps will be added at the intersections of Clifton/Macey, Clifton/Clybourn, Wisconsin/Marcey, and Wisconsin/Kingsbury. A new traffic signal with pedestrian countdowns and improved ADA ramps are planned for the intersection of Wisconsin/Clybourn. During the meeting a number of residents were concerned about traffic and congestion in the area and how the development would exacerbate the situation. The project site is within a half mile of the Armitage CTA L stop, the North/Clybourn CTA L stop, and the Metra Clybourn stop. Several bus routes are located within walking distance, there are bike lanes on W. Cortland St and N. Clybourn Ave, and there are several Divvy stations nearby. All of these nearby assets will help reduce car traffic generated by the project.  Sterling Bay plans to include 92 units of affordable housing in the project and pay a fee in-lieu of $4.5 million. The project will pay $3.6 million as a North Branch Corridor Bonus Fee and $1.15 million in North Branch Industrial Conversion Fee. The development team told neighbors that they have yet to secure financing for the development. With some neighbors opposed and some in support of the development, Sterling Bay will continue to work with the Department of Planning and Development and Alderman Waguespack’s office to fine tune the development before seeking official approvals from the city.

Located across from Oz Park, the midblock site is located between N. Orchard St and N. Larrabee St. Planned by owner Grace Lee, the development will demolish the two-story red brick residential structure that currently occupies the parcel. With Kuanhao Chen from SHB Studio as the architect, the new construction will be a four-story masonry condominium building with three new homes included. The future homeowners will have access to front and rear balconies, rear decks, roof decks, and a new garage at the back with space for three cars. While the full building permit has been issued, general contractor Simple Home Builders is still awaiting the demolition permit to clear the site. ",Lincoln Park,0.0
Full building permit issued for 438 W. Saint James,"A full building permit has been issued for a residential development at 438 W. Saint James Pl. While the project will not rezone its site or establish Planned Development, the project received a Lakefront Protection Ordinance approval due to its proximity to the lakefront. Located within Lincoln Park, the site is a few blocks north of W. Fullerton Ave and is between N. Clark St and Lincoln Park itself.  Planned by Genna Hill via St. James Interests LLC, the revised project will redevelop the site with a five-story building, down from a ten-story building that was originally planned. Occupying a parcel just 33 feet wide, the new building will host a mere four residential units. The ground floor of the building will provide 5 interior parking spaces. Rising 67 feet tall, architects Hirsch MPG have swapped out the contemporary glassy design for a more modest, brick-clad design. With such a narrow building surrounded on three sides, the street frontage has been setback and will include the residential entry to the west, the parking garage entry in the center, and the second egress exit door to the east side.  While the original 10-story building was approved back in May 2022, the developer decided to scale back the project after talking with neighbors and realizing how difficult it would be to build on the thin site, having to deal with a tower crane and associated logistics for the tiny site. The scaled back building will now be able to be built with wood construction and masonry on the outside, simplifying the construction process. With the caisson permit issued in August, the issuance of the full building permit will allow general contractor G Corp to work on the $5.5 million development through completion. ",Lincoln Park,0.0
City Council approves 1649 N. Halsted,"The Chicago City Council has approved the mixed-use development planned at 1649 N. Halsted. Led by Draper and Kramer, the project will replace the shuttered Royal George Theater and adjacent four-story structure to the south. The former theater space is now considered obsolete as it has been marketed to other theater companies including Steppenwolf and ultimately the size, capacity, and configuration in a post-COVID era make it undesirable to continue using it as a theater. With SGW Architecture and Design in charge of the architecture, the building will stand eight floors high with a ninth partial floor that will hold amenity space and connect to an outdoor roof deck. Providing 131 rental units, the project’s unit mix will consist of 12 studios, 91 one-beds, 26 two beds and 2 three beds. Out of those units, 20 will be affordable with a mix of 2 studios, 14 one-beds, and 4 two-beds. To satisfy the remaining obligation of 6.2 units, Draper and Kramer will pay a fee in-lieu of $940,000. Inspired by the theater past of the site and vibrant theater community of the area, the front facade is a subtle allusion to a theater curtain, folding the glass wall to create a rippling effect reinforced by the slab edge covers that reference a modern treatment of bay windows. To reduce the mass of the building, the eighth and ninth floors have been setback considerably from the street. After conversations with Alderman Hopkins and neighbors, brick masonry was added to the building’s design and replaced glazing at the ground floor. Vertical ribbons of terracotta rainscreen have been added in a color that will match the brick. At the ground floor, the residential entry will be located at the north end of the frontage, while the 4,500 square feet of retail space will occupy the rest of the frontage and feature a 13-foot setback to allow space for outdoor dining as the retail space is targeted for a restaurant operator. Parking for 34 cars and 131 bikes is located in an enclosed garage on the ground floor accessed from the alley. The development sought a rezoning from B3-2 to B3-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. Alderman Hopkins officially gave his approval of the project after a contentious two years of negotiations and community meetings that resulted in some of the aforementioned design changes as well as a $300,000 investment that will go towards expanding a city park at the corner of North and Larrabee. After the Chicago Plan Commission approved the $53 million development in August, the proposal received approval from the Committee on Zoning and now finally the City Council, allowing for the project to move forward with its full entitlements. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Lincoln Park,1.0
DePaul University plans basketball practice facility,"DePaul University has announced plans to renovate the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena as well as to build a new practice facility for the school’s basketball teams. Planned for the northwest corner of W. Belden Ave and N. Sheffield Ave, the new facility will rise across the street from the current Sullivan Athletic Center and will replace a recently acquired, university-owned apartment complex in addition to four other smaller buildings in this area, including the current Athletics Annex and other housing-managed properties. Designed by HNTB and Antunovich Associates, the new facility will feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. While the addition of Wintrust Arena increased their visibility, ability to recruit, and footprint in Chicago, DePaul is continuing to take steps towards being able to provide each of the 15 sports programs with the facilities they need to be competitive in the BIG EAST Conference. DePaul men’s and women’s basketball will move their training, practices, and operations across the street from the Sullivan Athletics Center to allow for more dedicated spaces to support the programs.  Dedicated practice courts for each basketball program will greatly alleviate scheduling concerns, as all 15 of DePaul’s programs currently share the McGrath-Phillips Arena courts. The first floor of the facility will be dedicated to the health and wellness of all 215+ DePaul student-athletes, and will include a team dining space, nutrition bar, new sports medicine treatment spaces and offices, hydrotherapy, a weight room, and multi-purpose meeting rooms. Set to cost $60 million, the project will be funded primarily through donor gifts and via a fundraising campaign approved by the Philanthropy Committee of DePaul’s Board of Trustees. As the project moves forward, the demolition of buildings on site would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest. Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026.

Rental penthouses now leasing at The Belden-Stratford,"Leasing is now underway for a selection of just-released rental penthouses at The Belden-Stratford, the iconic Beaux-Arts apartment property in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighborhood that reopened this year following a full-scale restoration and renovation. The six penthouse residences showcase unobstructed views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline from the property’s upper floors, paired with thoughtfully designed floor plans and upscale finishes that complement historic structural details. “Our penthouse residences truly embody what makes The Belden-Stratford so special, from graceful spaces carefully appointed to appeal to today’s modern renters, to glimpses of this century-old building’s history and architecture, to an unmatched address in Lincoln Park that affords residents not only an amazing lifestyle, but also some of the very best views in the entire city,” said Ari Glass, head of real estate for Mansueto Office. Overlooking the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory, the 16-story property was constructed in 1923 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by architect Meyer Fridstein, it originally opened as a residential hotel before eventually transitioning entirely to rental apartments. The Belden-Stratford was purchased in 2018 by Mansueto Office – the investment firm of Joe Mansueto, who was a resident of the property during the 1980s – and renovation work began in late 2020. Today, it comprises 209 luxury apartments, including studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom residences as well as a selection of penthouses with double-height living space, with monthly rents ranging from $2,500 to $15,000. Penthouse rents start at $7,250. The penthouses are located on the 15th floor, along the building’s entire east and south sides, and are topped by the building’s roof deck. The five remaining penthouse floor plans include two one-bedroom designs with one and 1 1⁄2 baths, respectively; a two-bedroom, two-bath layout; and two residences with two bedrooms, two baths and a den. All penthouse residences feature extra-high ceilings – including spaces with 17-foot ceilings with decorative beams – and double-height windows topped by paned arches, which, in addition to framing sweeping views of Lake Michigan and Lincoln Park, are also a notable architectural detail accenting the building’s mansard roofline. Penthouse interiors feature upscale island kitchens with GE Profile stainless steel appliances and quartz countertops; upsized window trim; custom closets with built-in shelving; and full-size in-unit washer and dryer. Complementing the penthouse lifestyle at The Belden-Stratford is the ambiance of the building’s many original features and finishes that were restored during the renovation process. In the ornate double-height lobby, gilded plaster molding and gold-leaf detailing were fully refurbished, as were marble paneling and entryways adorned with mirrored windows and walnut trim, which had been covered during previous renovations. In addition, hand-painted canvases that hung on the walls when the building first opened were recreated. The renovation also introduced a full suite of lifestyle amenities as the building was reimagined for modern renters. Housed in the historic property’s original common spaces, they include an elegant mezzanine-level lounge with an original arched picture window overlooking the Lincoln Park Conservatory; a double-height fitness center in what was once the building’s ballroom; a billiards and media lounge; wine tasting room; temperature-controlled wine storage room; and reservable conference rooms and meeting areas. Residents also have access to a rooftop sun deck featuring a wet bar, outdoor TV, two gas fireplaces, grilling stations and multiple seating areas, all overlooking the skyline, Lincoln Park and Lake Michigan. Additional resident offerings include Luxer One package service and on-site Tesla rentals. The Belden-Stratford is also home to Mon Ami Gabi, a popular French bistro with a direct connection to the building’s lobby, giving residents an elegant on-site dining option in addition to the variety of restaurants found in the surrounding neighborhood. For leasing information or to schedule a tour, visit www.BeldenStratford.com or call (844) 326-5908. An on-site leasing office is open daily by appointment only.   ",Lincoln Park,0.0

Committee on Design reviews 2033 N. Kingsbury,"The Committee on Design has reviewed Sterling Bay’s proposal for a mixed-use tower at 2033 N. Kingsbury. Originally announced in September 2022, the project site is directly across the street from Lincoln Yards North. With a combination of low-rise retail buildings and parking lots surrounding the site, the tower will be a middle ground between the new high-density towers of Lincoln Yards and the low-rise neighbors along N. Clybourn Ave. Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the development was originally conceived as a 15-story residential tower that would stand 167 feet tall. In response to feedback, the tower was condensed and received a height increase, resulting in a 25-story, 275-foot-tall scheme. The project would have 359 residential units, 8,600 square feet of retail, 200 parking spaces, and 359 bike parking. Outdoors, the revised scheme increased the planned open space from 13,000 square feet to 22,000 square feet. The new design has increased the amount of air space around the tower and was pulled back to allow for a visual connection to the Lincoln Yards parkland from the Clybourn corridor. The massing steps back as it rises and offsets in plan to break up the scale of the building. At the base, the podium stands three stories tall to accommodate the planned 200 parking spaces on two floors. The facade has been designed with a residential character, using a gridded facade made up of brick and glass with aluminum slab edge covers. On the ground floor, the residential parking access is via a curb cut on the north end of the frontage along N. Kingsbury St to reduce pressure on the alley which is currently used for loading and trash pickup from the retail center along N. Clybourn Ave. The 8,600 square feet of retail is located at the south end of the frontage wrapping around to face the green space, with the residential lobby in the center of the ground floor. A setback of 21 feet at the retail space will allow for covered outdoor dining if the space is filled with a food service tenant. Jeanne Gang began the discussion by questioning the glass railings at the amenity decks with landscaping. The design team responded that they will be meeting the bird-friendly ordinance and the railing material may change through the design process. Gang clarified that glass itself wasn’t the problem, but that they would need to add a frit pattern regardless of the adjacency to the greenery to protect migratory birds. The design team committed to using a bird-safe glass solution or changing to a different material that wouldn't risk bird strikes.  Casey Jones chimed in next to commend the team on shrinking the building footprint and going taller with the tower. Jones followed it up with a comment that he felt the tower was not the best architectural addition to the city and hoped there would be greater refinement of the tower as the design progresses. The design team responded that the point was well-taken and they have a fair amount of work ahead of them to make refinements.  Eleanor Gorski mentioned that the wall facing the alley is currently a solid wall and would be visible over the retail strip mall from N. Clybourn Ave. Gorski urged the team to think about what that wall would be as it stands visible for an unknown amount of time before that retail center would potentially get redeveloped. While the design team also acknowledged that the retail center may eventually get redeveloped, they agreed that they don’t like to build blank walls and will get to refining that facade as they progress with the design. Andre Brumfield commented that he felt the taller building responded better to the context and that this revision is an improvement from the original scheme. Brumfield followed that up by saying that he felt it would improve the design if they brought some of the softening of the original massing into the current design.  Maria Villalobos finished the comment portion by asking what was driving the size of the podium. The design team responded that the podium is three floors to accommodate the 200 parking spaces and it may be able to shrink but not by much. Villalobos asked whether the parking count is a requirement or preference, to which the design team responded that it was a preference based on what the team thought market demand would be. With the input from the Committee on Design, the developer and architects will continue their work with DPD and likely revise the design before moving forward in the approval process. With a rezoning from M2-2 to B3-5 and a Planned Development requested for the site, the development will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.

Alderman Hopkins throws support behind 1649 N. Halsted,"Alderman Hopkins announced via an email to constituents that he will be supporting the zoning change for the mixed-use development at 1649 N. Halsted as it heads to the Plan Commission later this month. Originally proposed back in June 2021, developer Draper & Kramer had an initial meeting with Alderman Hopkins to rezone the former Royal George Theater property and a neighboring building to allow for the construction of a new, multi-family residential building with 192 units. After discussions with the alderman’s office and meeting with neighbors, the developer came back with a 134-unit proposal with ground floor retail space. The meetings also resulted in façade upgrades and changes in materials and window sizes.  Reductions were also made in the massing of the building on the upper floors. The developer also met with Steppenwolf Theater and decided to set aside 2-4 units for visiting Steppenwolf artists and indicate artist preference on all affordable units built (15% of total unit count). In the summer of 2022, the alderman hosted a community meeting where the proposal was shared with the wider neighborhood. Outcomes of that meeting included an agreement that deliveries and garbage pickup for both the residential and retail elements of the building would be limited to off-peak hours. It was also agreed at that meeting that residents of the proposed building would be restricted from obtaining on-street permit parking. With more feedback from the community and DPD, the developer and architects SGW Architecture & Design modified the design to add brickwork at grade instead of glass and vertical terracotta accents were added. At Alderman Hopkins’ request, the developer will also contribute $300,000 toward the construction of new park land at the southwest corner of N. Larrabee St and W. North Ave. This space, once a portion of Ogden Avenue's right-of-way, will significantly increase the size of Park 598 as the Chicago Park District prepares it to go through a major makeover. The project will connect the entire park with the greater neighborhood by bringing it underneath the CTA tracks and all the way north to North Avenue.  With the rezoning and Planned Development designation now in the approval process, Alderman Hopkins support allows the development to head to the Chicago Plan Commission to seek approvals before getting further approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.

1649 N. Halsted heads to Plan Commission later this month,"The mixed-use development at 1649 N. Halsted is heading to Plan Commission later this month to seek approval. Led by Draper and Kramer, the project will replace the shuttered Royal George Theater and adjacent four-story structure to the south. The former theater space is now considered obsolete as it has been marketed to other theater companies including Steppenwolf and ultimately the size, capacity, and configuration in a post-COVID era make it undesirable to continue using it as a theater. With SGW Architecture and Design in charge of the architecture, the building will stand eight floors high with a ninth partial floor that will hold amenity space and connect to an outdoor roof deck. Providing 133 rental units, the project’s unit mix will consist of 12 studios, 25 one-beds, 68 loft-style one-beds (borrowed light bedrooms), 26 two-beds, and a final 2 three-bedroom apartments. At the ground floor, retail space will stretch along the majority of the street frontage, targeted for restaurant use. Parking for 35 cars will be located in an enclosed garage off the alley.  Inspired by the theater past of the site and vibrant theater community of the area, the front facade is a subtle allusion to a theater curtain, folding the glass wall to create a rippling effect reinforced by the slab edge covers that reference a modern treatment of bay windows. The mass of the building is designed to align with the approved building planned to the south of this site, and the top floor of units have been pulled back from the street frontage to reduce the mass of the building along the street. The development will be seeking a rezoning from B3-2 to B3-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. If the Chicago Plan Commission approves the project, the proposal will head to City Hall to get final approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. ",Lincoln Park,1.0
Urbanize gets an inside look at The Belden-Stratford,"Urbanize recently got an inside look at the Belden-Stratford, the iconic Beaux-Arts apartment building in Lincoln Park. Located at 2300 N. Lincoln Park West, the building has just reopened to residents following an extensive renovation that has restored the grandeur of the 100-year-old building while providing amenities and residences for today’s renters. Overlooking the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory, the 16-story property was constructed in 1923 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by architect Meyer Fridstein, it originally opened as a residential hotel before eventually transitioning entirely to rental apartments. The Belden-Stratford was purchased in 2018 by Mansueto Office – the investment firm of Joe Mansueto, who was a resident of the property during the 1980s – and renovation work began in late 2020. Today, it comprises 209 luxury apartments, including studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom residences as well as a selection of penthouses with double-height living space, with monthly rents ranging from $2,500 to $15,000.  With our tour led by Ted Fahey, vice president of real estate for Mansueto Office, we began in the building’s main lobby, whose gilded plaster molding and gold-leaf detailing was fully refurbished. With Solomon Cordwell Buenz as architect of record and Vinci Hamp Architects serving as the historic architect, much of the work done around the building was undoing changes made over the years to bring the property back to its original splendor. Heading up to the second floor, we toured the building’s new amenity offerings for residents. The building’s amenity package includes a two-level fitness center that used to be a ballroom, a billiards and media lounge, wine tasting room, reservable conference rooms and meeting space, and a basement wine storage room. Residents also have access to a mezzanine level lounge that overlooks the lobby and faces outside through an original arched picture window.  Working our way up the building, we next looked at a few model units. All residences have 9-foot ceilings and are appointed with an elegant finish package including quartz countertops, GE Profile™ stainless steel appliances and full-size, front-loading washers and dryers. The apartments measure between 483 and 1,689 square feet. We also stopped by one of the penthouse units on the 15th floor which feature double-height living spaces. We finished out the tour by heading up to the building’s roof deck. Outfitted with grilling stations and seating areas, the south- and east-facing roof deck provides extensive views of Lincoln Park, Lake Michigan, and the downtown skyline to the south. Leasing and move-ins are underway, and the building is expected to be fully occupied by year-end. For leasing information or to schedule a tour, visit www.BeldenStratford.com or call (844) 326-5908. An on-site leasing office is open daily by appointment only.   ",Lincoln Park,0.0
CTA announces reopening of Forest Park Blue Line tracks,"The Chicago Transit Authority has announced the completion of major track work as part of Phase 1 of the Forest Park Branch Rebuild. Blue Line trains are now running between the O’Hare and Forest Park stations, making all stops for the first since late-July. “Thanks to the coordination and tireless work from across the agency, this line-cut has finished on-time and on-budget— a timely benefit to the entire Blue Line,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “We knew that project work of this scale would be a disruption to our riders, which is why we kept an aggressive pace for the line-cut, working around the clock to resume normal service along our second busiest rail line.” As part of this $268 million project, crews have completely rebuilt almost three miles of track, between the LaSalle and Illinois Medical District (IMD) stations in 11 weeks. Additional work planned as part of Phase 1 project work continues, including the complete reconstruction of the Racine main station entrance and auxiliary entrance, as well as construction of the new Morgan substation. As the work was planned to minimize impact on customers, CTA sequenced the project to complete the trackwork with bus shuttle support and then complete the signal work while trains are running.  As such, trains will run temporarily at a reduced speed between LaSalle and IMD and then gradually increase up to the posted speed.  The full speed restoration is anticipated by the end of this year. Anticipated impacts to Blue Line service are expected in 2024-2025 as the remaining portions of Phase 1 project work is completed. Crews are continuing work to upgrade the traction power system that provides electricity to the system and will result in improved service reliability for the Blue Line. This work entails the construction of a new substation over the right-of-way at Morgan Street, as well as other upgrades being made to power system components in the area. The existing Racine station has already been demolished and crews have begun to rebuild the Racine main station entrance to make it fully accessible to those who use mobility devices. The station house at the main Racine entrance will include a new elevator. In addition to the elevator, a longer platform and new stairs will replace the ramp that once connected the platform to street level at Racine Avenue. The main entrance of the Racine station will remain closed and is expected to re-open in late-2024, at which time the Loomis St. auxiliary entrance will close for reconstruction through 2025. The Loomis St. auxiliary entrance of the Racine station reopened following the completion of track work.  ",Near West Side,0.0
Chicago City Council approves Fifth-Third Arena expansion,"The Chicago City Council has approved the expansion of Fifth-Third Arena at 301 S. Damen. Located at the southwest corner of W. Jackson Blvd and S. Wood St, the expansion will move west towards S. Damen Ave, occupying 4.25 acres out of 7.12 acres the team has acquired. Designed by Generator Studio, the expansion will consist of two regulation sized ice sheets with one such rink accommodating approximately 300 spectators and the other serving as a larger format rink with capacity of 1,500 spectators. The building will rise 44 feet against the existing arena and step up to 52 feet over the new westernmost ice rink.  The design complements the existing arena and breaks down the massing to improve the pedestrian experience and connect to the neighborhood. The main entry is pushed back from the street to create breathing room for pedestrians and help announce the entry. Glazing and lighting along the facade will contribute to improving the pedestrian experience and safety in the area. A smaller entryway on the south side of the building will cater to those coming from the Blue Line and the parking lot.  With Site Design Group on board, the landscaping will improve the pedestrian realm and lighten up W. Jackson Blvd. Exceeding the landscape ordinance, more than 60 trees will be added in addition to native plantings and an outdoor plaza. On the south side of the site, 215 parking spaces will be added to support the expansion.  With City Council approval secured, the site will be rezoned from B3-3 to C2-5 and the existing Planned Development is amended. Construction is expected to begin at the beginning of 2024 and wrap up in Q1 2026. As a result of community and alderman input, the proposal has foregone the potential residential or hotel development initially included in the zoning application. Any development on the western end of the site would require a fully separate review and approval process. ",Near West Side,0.0

Renderings emerge for Canal Station redevelopment,"Renderings have emerged for the redevelopment of Canal Station. Located at 801 S. Canal, the 850,000-square-foot building is being reimagined by New York-based 601W. Spanning almost an entire city block between W. Polk St and W. Taylor St, the six-story building used to be leased by Northern Trust.   With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board, the design will take advantage of the existing high bay large floor plates, concrete structure, loading docks, and utility infrastructure to deliver a highly amenitized workplace that can meet the needs of a broad range of tenants. Significant upgrades to the building façade allow for more natural light within the building, as well create a new identity for the building’s main entry. The lobby will be completely reimagined, incorporating a new monumental stair and a signature media screen. A new security desk is envisioned as a sculptural art form, serving as a central focal point within the generous volume of the lobby. Layered materials and textures of bleached maple, cold-rolled steel metal screens, and concrete floors offer a sophisticated urban ambiance and sense of welcome to the space. New retail spaces envisioned for cafes or bars open to the lobby, activating the space. A new tenant amenity package will measure 30,000 square feet, including a 7,300-square-foot outdoor terrace, a 5,000-square-foot fitness center, a tenant lounge and a conference center. Most floors will come with small, private outdoor terrace spaces for office tenants. 601W plans to offer tenants a shuttle bus along Canal Street to Union Station and Ogilvie Transportation Center, as well as 375 on-site parking spaces and new streetscapes next to the building. The $265 million is currently under construction and is targeted for completion by the end of the year. ",Near West Side,0.0

CTA announces rebuild of the Blue Line’s Forest Park branch,"As part of ongoing efforts to provide better, more reliable and accessible services to all Chicago transit users, the Chicago Transit Authority recently announced the start of work associated with Forest Park Branch Rebuild – a multi-year, multi-phased investment program to reconstruct the entire Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line and make it 100% accessible to those who use mobility devices. “The Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line is a critical transit asset for Chicago’s West Side communities, directly serving the Illinois Medical District, several schools and colleges, as well as numerous other growing employment centers,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The start of this project work is long overdue, and the CTA is committed to securing the additional funding to advance future phases of work to provide all Blue Line riders a better transit experience.” Work associated with Phase I of the Forest Park Branch Rebuild is scheduled to occur beginning Sunday, July 23 through Saturday, October 7. As part of this $268 million project, crews will completely rebuild 15,000 feet or almost three miles of track between the LaSalle and Illinois Medical District (IMD) stations; demolish and begin rebuilding the Racine station to meet modern accessibility guidelines; and upgrade the traction power system for improved service reliability. Opened in 1958, back when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line has received some improvements, but after six decades of heavy use the tracks along the entire branch are beyond their useful life. This has resulted in nearly 80% of the branch being under slow zones, which cause service delays. Further, only four of the eleven stations (or 30%) along the branch are accessible to people who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices. To reduce travel impacts to customers, project work will be performed in two parts. Part A, lasting from July 23rd through late August will see the rebuilding of the track between the UIC-Halsted and LaSalle stations. During this time, Blue Line trains will operate in two segments: 1) between O’Hare and LaSalle, and 2) between Forest Park and IMD. The Clinton, UIC-Halsted and Racine stations will be temporarily closed. Part B, lasting from late August until October 7th will rebuild the track between the IMD and UIC-Halsted stations. During this time, Blue Line trains will operate in two segments: 1) between O’Hare and UIC-Halsted, and 2) between Forest Park and IMD. The Clinton, UIC-Halsted, and IMD stations will be open for rider use. Upon completion of track work in October, the Racine-Loomis St. auxiliary entrance only will re-open. The main entrance of the Racine station will remain closed and is expected to re-open in late-2024, at which time the Loomis St. Auxiliary entrance will close for reconstruction through 2025. Phase I project work is funded by a mix of state and local resources, including Rebuild Illinois, TIF and CTA Bonds. Additional funding is needed to advance future phases of the Forest Park Branch Rebuild, which in total is estimated to cost $3 billion, including Phase I work. More detailed information regarding alternative service options will be announced and made available on the project website (transitchicago.com/FPrebuild) in the coming weeks. ",Near West Side,0.0
Westhaven Park IID breaks ground,"Developers Brinshore Development and The Michaels Organization recently celebrated the groundbreaking of Westhaven Park IID, with Alderman Walter Burnett Jr and representatives from the Chicago Department of Housing in attendance among others. Located at 145 N. Damen, the new mixed-income building will occupy a parcel at the corner of N. Damen Ave and W. Lake St, across from the future Damen Green Line. With Landon Bone Baker Architects on the project, the 12-story, mixed-use building will rise 136 feet. With three retail spaces on the ground floor, 96 units will be located on the upper floors. Planned as a mix of 63 affordable units and 33 market-rate apartments, the rentals will include one-bed and two-bed configurations. 16 car parking spaces will be provided on the ground floor as well as 106 bicycle parking spaces. The project’s design consists of a two-part volume, with the taller 12-story portion sited closer to the CTA tracks. At the southern end of the site, the shorter 4-story volume interlocks with the taller portion with a one story base setting it back from the street. The active retail uses front N. Damen Ave with the residential entry notched into at the intersection between the two building volumes.  The $41.2 million will be funded in part by a $10 million TIF payment from the city.

City Church Chicago plans mixed-use expansion at 116 S. Paulina,"City Church Chicago has submitted a zoning application for their future home at 116 S. Paulina. Located at the northeast corner of S. Paulina St and W. Adams St, the site is currently vacant with CTA L tracks running along its western property line. Designed by Hutton and Hutton Architects and Engineers, the project is expected to be built out in multiple phases. Phase 1 will build a two-story building on the southern portion of the site, spanning 40,000 sf of space. The inside will hold City Church’s main worship space set to seat 1,500 people as well as retail space, a cafe, and administrative spaces. The second phase will expand the two-story volume to the north, filling in the site. This expansion will include multipurpose and conference rooms, youth programming and childcare areas, and shared admin and business office space.  The final and third phase will see the construction of a 12-story residential tower perched on top of the second phase on the northern portion of the property. Clad in glass and aluminum paneling, the 184-foot-tall tower will hold 76 residential units, with 15 of them set aside as affordable. With the project moving forward, City Church is seeking a rezoning from C1-3 to B3-5 before instituting an overall Planned Development designation. The proposal will undergo internal review by the Chicago Department of Planning and Development before seeking approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.

Blackhawks submit zoning application for Fifth Third Arena expansion,"The owners of the Chicago Blackhawks have submitted a zoning application for the expansion of Fifth Third Arena at 301 S. Damen. Located at the southwest corner of W. Jackson Blvd an S. Wood St, the expansion will move west towards S. Damen Ave occupying 4.25 acres out of 7.12 acres the team will be acquiring from Rush.  The Chicago Blackhawks and its ownership are committed to making Chicago proud by growing the game of hockey while simultaneously serving the surrounding community by increasing youth programming and creating an ecosystem of jobs and careers related to sports, entertainment and hospitality. This proposed expansion will blend seamlessly into the surrounding neighborhood, with a focus on enhancing the pedestrian experience and an emphasis of creating better multimodal connectivity on West Jackson Boulevard. Designed by Kansas City-based Generator Studio, the project team is providing a modem and cohesive design with the existing building and other nearby athletic facilities, including the United Center and the Advocate Center, the Chicago Bulls' recently constructed training facility. Expansion of Fifth Third Arena will consist of two regulation sized ice sheets with one such rink accommodating approximately 300 spectators and the other serving as a larger format rink with capacity of 1,500 spectators. The large format rink will provide increased opportunities to bid on more diverse entertainment events and attractions.  In addition to the two new rinks, the development will add a welcoming, light-filled central gathering space, 200 additional parking lot spaces, locker rooms, food and beverage space, and multi-use rooms. The expanded building structure will be designed to meet LEED Silver equivalent standards and will include a partial green roof, ample bicycle parking spaces, EV charging stations, and professionally designed eco-conscious exterior landscaping, in addition to the existing 26 bicycle parking spaces that will remain. With a large portion of the expansion being opaque, the potential for migratory bird collisions will be minimized. Parking areas will be well-landscaped and fenced, consistent with the City of Chicago's current standards.  While the Chicago Blackhawks will continue to utilize the existing facility for practice and rehabilitation, the team uses a very small percentage of the ice time. The additional ice rinks will provide new and expanded opportunities for programming and attraction of local and national events, tournaments, and entertainment. Upon completion, the four rinks will provide enhanced engagement of hockey and ice-skating programs to a wide range of users, with emphasis on local youth development. Programs will include ice skating, figure skating, recreational skating, recreational and advanced hockey leagues, tournaments, high school and college teams, semi-professional teams, off-ice training - including fitness and nutritional programs, and group events. The Chicago Blackhawks Foundation will continue to provide complimentary community programming including, but not limited to, hockey and off-ice development programs for local youth groups. The proposed expansion will also provide future generations of players, employees, neighbors and community members with a centrally located, city-centric home to learn, play and develop practical skills intended to serve them well beyond their time on the ice.  With future phases included in the zoning application, the further development could include as many as 1,200 residential units and 663 hotel keys, with retail space and parking included. Capped at a height of 295 feet, this future development has yet to be designed. This future work will need to be submitted to the city for site plan approval with a courtesy presentation to the Chicago Plan Commission before construction could begin. Looking forward, the Blackhawks will be finalizing the acquisition of the land from Rush, following the entering of the subject site by Rush into a lEPA Remedial Action Program, with projected acquisition taking place during Q3 or Q4 2023. Construction is set to commence in Q1 2024 and conclude during Q1 2026. The project is anticipated to be funded through a combination of traditional bank financing and private funding. The additional future development of retail, hotel, and residential buildings is anticipated to occur in future years beyond 2026.  ",Near West Side,0.0

Greater Union Baptist Church is officially a landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation of Greater Union Baptist Church. Located at 1956 W. Warren, the church stands at the northeast corner of W. Warren Blvd and N. Damen Ave adjacent to the United Center’s vast parking lots. Originally built in 1886 as the Church of the Redeemer, the church was designed by prolific architect William Le Baron Jenney. In 1928, the church was bought by a black Baptist congregation and has been used as their place of worship for the last 94 years.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Greater Union Baptist Church traces its origin back to the universalist congregation who built the building. During the Civil War, the men and pastor served in the Union Army. After the war was over, the congregation had grown and raised funds to build the present church. They worshiped for 42 years and during that time provided extensive charitable aid to the community and hosted progressive-era lectures. For its association with two energetic pastors, the building also meets Criterion 3 for significant people. Reverend Shelbia Hamilton Graham preached from 1947 to 1967 and used the pulpit to support the spiritual needs of the congregation as well as the social needs of Chicago’s African American community at-large. Reverend Dr. Walter A McCray served from 1996 - 2002 and returned to the pulpit in 2018, serving to this day. Reverend McCray has increased community outreach and charitable programs at the church and is a nationally recognized, published biblical scholar. The next criterion the church meets is Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney, the brick church reflects Romanesque Revival with its distinct terracotta details and deep-set round arched windows. Jenney’s distinct articulation is visible on the church, with the single large gables on each facade reflecting his preference for fewer elements at a larger scale rather than smaller repeating forms. His trademark varnished southern pine-clad ceilings are also present in the soaring worship space of the church.  Pairing well with Criterion 4, the church also meets Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect or designer. As discussed earlier, William Le Baron Jenney is the architect of this church, however he’s best known for the invention of the skyscraper, designing the Home Insurance Building as the first skyscraper in the world. His design philosophy and the use of the metal frame for the skyscraper cleared the way for progressive architecture to flourish in the late 19th century.  Retaining a superb level of integrity, the church also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. Over its 136-year history, the church has endured economic disinvestment in its community and the dramatic change to the neighborhood due to the construction of the United Center and its associated parking lots. With credit due to its congregation, the church is a rare survivor of dire economic issues in the area.  With the landmark designation approved by the Chicago City Council, the church is now officially landmarked and is protected from demolition. As a part of the designation, the building’s exterior elevations and rooflines will be protected.  ",Near West Side,0.0
Chicago Fire breaks ground on training facility,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined Chicago FC Owner and Chairman Joe Mansueto, Alderman Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) CEO Tracey Scott, and Mary Baggett, President of the Local Advisory Committee for ABLA/Brooks Homes to celebrate the groundbreaking of the Fire’s new performance and training facility at 1336 S. Loomis in the Roosevelt Square neighborhood on the Near West Side.   ""The Chicago Fire is a top tier football club and the team and its players deserve a top tier training facility,"" said Mayor Lightfoot. ""I am also pleased that the Near West Side community will benefit from the job opportunities, recreational space, and housing support that CFFC has committed to providing as part of this development.""   As a complex for the team to prepare for matches and improve the team, it will include two and a half hybrid grass fields for the team and three synthetic turf fields for the Chicago Fire Academy. An inflatable dome will be placed on top of the northwest field during the colder months from November to March. With Crawford Architects on board for the design, the training facility will measure 53,000 square feet and stand two floors high, down from an original 95,000 square-foot, three-story plan. On the ground floor, program space will include locker rooms, medical space, workout space, hydrotherapy, and a video room. The second floor will host offices, a cafeteria, and meeting space for team operations. A 4,100 square foot building for the field crew will be located just off S. Loomis St and W. Hastings St. The campus will include a pedestrian greenway corridor through the site. Starting at the intersection of S. Loomis St and W. 14th Pl, the pathway will run through the site over to S. Ashland Ave and W. 14th St. Projected to cost $75-80 million, the project will be entirely privately funded by the team, with no city financing. The city recently announced the signing of a ground lease between the Chicago Fire FC and the Chicago Housing Authority that will generate $40 million in revenue for CHA over the next 40 years which will be applied towards the agency’s housing initiatives.

First permit issued for Chicago Fire training facility,"A building permit has been issued for the Chicago Fire’s planned training facility in the Near West Side. Located within the CHA’s Roosevelt Square masterplan, the 23.3-acre site is generally bounded by W. Roosevelt Rd, S. Ashland Ave, W. 14th St, and S. Loomis St. The property was previously occupied by portions of CHA’s former ABLA Homes. As a complex for the team to prepare for matches and improve the team, it will include two and a half hybrid grass fields for the team and three synthetic turf fields for the Chicago Fire Academy. An inflatable dome will be placed on top of the northwest field during the colder months from November to March. With Crawford Architects on board for the design, the training facility will measure 53,000 square feet and stand two floors high, down from an original 95,000 square-foot, three-story plan. On the ground floor, program space will include locker rooms, medical space, workout space, hydrotherapy, and a video room. The second floor will host offices, a cafeteria, and meeting space for team operations. A 4,100 square foot building for the field crew will be located just off S. Loomis St and W. Hastings St. The campus will include a pedestrian greenway corridor through the site. Starting at the intersection of S. Loomis St and W. 14th Pl, the pathway will run through the site over to S. Ashland Ave and W. 14th St. Projected to cost $75-80 million, the project will be entirely privately funded by the team, with no city financing. The city recently announced the signing of a ground lease between the Chicago Fire FC and the Chicago Housing Authority that will generate $40 million in revenue for CHA over the next 40 years which will be applied towards the agency’s housing initiatives. This first permit issued for the project will allow for the construction of the one-story maintenance building for field crew and site work for the practice fields. Pepper Construction will be leading the construction of the facility which is targeted for a Summer 2024 opening. ",Near West Side,0.0
CTA awards contract for Racine Blue Line renovation,"The Chicago Transit Authority recently announced that the Racine Blue Line station is set to receive a major renovation after awarding a $75 million construction contract. As part of the CTA’s All Stations Accessibility Program, the work will make the station fully accessible with the addition of an elevator and other improvements.  Funded through Governor Pritzker’s Rebuild Illinois Capital Plan, the Chicago Transit Board approved the awarding of a contract not to exceed $75.4 million to FH Paschen following a competitive procurement process.  “This is another exciting step forward in our commitment to making the entire CTA rail system fully accessible,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The CTA has collaborated with Chicago’s disability community to pursue a vision of 100% accessibility for all customers.  Thanks to the funding we received through the Rebuild Illinois capital program, we’re now able to “unlock” one more station and soon provide a fully-accessible transit option for not only this West Side community, but for any of the millions who travel our rail system each year.”  Originally built in 1958, work at the Racine Blue Line Station will include fully reconstructing the main stationhouse located at 430 S. Racine with the inclusion of a new elevator, as well as significant upgrades to the auxiliary entrance and exit on S. Loomis St. a new ADA-accessible ramp from the station house to the platform will be constructed alongside new stairs and an extension of the platform itself.  To help improve the reliability of services and as part of larger plans to add additional trains to the Blue Line, the traction power system, which helps provide the power to run trains, will also get upgrades. That work will include a new power substation at Morgan Street, replacement of equipment at the existing Hermitage substation and other electrical work. Once completed, the Racine station will have clearly defined accessible pathways to and from train platforms, bus stops, and other major modal transfer points. All features along the pathway, such as fare arrays, shelters, benches, and passenger information, will be redesigned to remove barriers and allow for universal accessibility. Details regarding the timeline of project work, including start and completion dates, have not been announced yet. ",Near West Side,0.0
Final landmark approved for Greater Union Baptist Church,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for Greater Union Baptist Church. Located at 1956 W. Warren, the church stands at the northeast corner of W. Warren Blvd and N. Damen Ave adjacent to the United Center’s vast parking lots. Originally built in 1886 as the Church of the Redeemer, the church was designed by prolific architect William Le Baron Jenney. In 1928, the church was bought by a black baptist congregation and has been used as their place of worship for the last 94 years.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Greater Union Baptist Church traces its origin back to the universalist congregation who built the building. During the Civil War, the men and pastor served in the Union Army. After the war was over, the congregation had grown and raised funds to build the present church. They worshiped for 42 years and during that time provided extensive charitable aid to the community and hosted progressive-era lectures. For its association with two energetic pastors, the building also meets Criterion 3 for significant people. Reverend Shelbia Hamilton Graham preached from 1947 to 1967 and used the pulpit to support the spiritual needs of the congregation as well as the social needs of Chicago’s African-American community at-large. Reverend Dr. Walter A McCray served from 1996 - 2002 and returned to the pulpit in 2018, serving to this day. Reverend McCray has increased community outreach and charitable programs at the church and is a nationally recognized, published biblical scholar. The next criteria the church meets is Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney, the brick church reflects Romanesque Revival with its distinct terracotta details and deep-set round arched windows. Jenney’s distinct articulation is visible on the church, with the single large gables on each facade reflecting his preference for fewer elements at a larger scale rather than smaller repeating forms. His trademark varnished southern pine-clad ceilings are also present in the soaring worship space of the church.  Pairing well with Criterion 4, the church also meets Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect or designer. As discussed earlier, William Le Baron Jenney is the architect of this church, however he’s best known for the invention of the skyscraper, designing the Home Insurance Building as the first skyscraper in the world. His design philosophy and the use of the metal frame for the skyscraper cleared the way for progressive architecture to flourish in the late 19th century.  Retaining a superb level of integrity, the church also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. Over its 136-year history, the church has endured economic disinvestment in its community and the dramatic change to the neighborhood due to the construction of the United Center and its associated parking lots. With credit due to its congregation, the church is a rare survivor of dire economic issues in the area.  With the final landmark recommendation approved by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the proposed designation will protect all exterior elevations and rooflines. The landmark designation must go through the Committee on Zoning and full City Council before the building is officially landmarked.  ",Near West Side,0.0
Related Midwest breaks ground on Roosevelt Square Phase 3B,"Related Midwest recently broke ground on Roosevelt Square Phase 3B, the next installment of the mixed-income, master-planned development spanning 160 acres on the Near West Side. Formerly the site of the ABLA public housing project, Related Midwest is working with the Chicago Department of Housing and Chicago Housing Authority to ultimately deliver more than 2,000 new housing units at Roosevelt Square in Chicago’s Near West Side.  “Roosevelt Square is a great example of a group of committed, skilled partners coming together to create housing solutions that work for the community,” said Curt Bailey, President of Related Midwest. “With the Chicago Housing Authority as our partner, Related is thrilled to invest in this community with the highest quality residences at all income levels and to help this community grow in a way that benefits all residents.” Designed by Moody Nolan and Landon Bone Baker Architects, the building at 1002 S. Racine will hold 67 apartments, 10,000 square feet of retail space, and 33 parking spaces. The six-story building will have a unit mix of 17 CHA units at 20-60% AMI and 50 market-rate residences. The building will feature a fitness center, an indoor entertainment space, an amenity terrace, tenant storage, and indoor bike storage. Fresh Stop Produce & Deli and The Slice Shop, a local grocer and pizzeria, will be opening its largest location on the ground floor of the building.  Located at 1257 W. Roosevelt and 1357 W. Roosevelt, the next two structures have been designed as sister buildings. With a design from DesignBridge, both will rise six stories, holding 70 residential units and 40 parking spaces each. The 70 units in each project will break down into 29 CHA apartments at 20-60% AMI, 20 low-income units at 60-80% AMI, and 21 market-rate residences. The buildings will feature a fitness center, outdoor amenity space, a dog run, a package receiving room, tenant storage and indoor bike storage. Currently the last remaining building from the Jane Addams Homes, the final building at 925 S. Ada St will be restored and converted into 15 apartments and the National Public Housing Museum. 37 parking spaces will be provided as part of this site. With a design from Landon Bone Baker Architects and HED Architects, the apartment mix will consist of five CHA units, five affordable residences, and five market-rate units.  As part of this phase, Related Midwest and partners are reinvesting in 184 existing affordable apartments that were built during Phase 1. The rehabilitated homes will be upgraded with new flooring, modern cabinets, quartz counters, stainless steel appliances and new energy-efficient systems. Nia Architects is in charge of the architecture for the renovations. “As Mayor, one of my highest priorities is ensuring that all of our residents have access to affordable, safe and high-quality housing that empowers them on their journey toward upward mobility,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “By breaking ground on Phase 3B of the Roosevelt Square project, we will be that much closer to making this goal a reality for residents on the Near West Side. Once completed, this transformative project will not only add to our affordable housing stock, but also serve as a shining example of what is possible when we all work together to advance equity and inclusion.” Phase 3B of Roosevelt Square is designed to meet the criteria for the Chicago Sustainability Program, including exceeding the energy code by 25 percent and reducing indoor water use by 25 percent. The site design also includes native plantings and car charging stations for electric vehicles.  The general contractor on the project is a group of 100% minority-led firms, including BOWA Construction, Blackwood Group, and MIKK. Work on the apartments within the National Public Housing Museum building will be led by GMA Construction. Phase 3B is expected to be completed in Summer 2024.  ",Near West Side,0.0

Salesforce Tower celebrates opening,"Salesforce has officially opened the doors of Salesforce Tower Chicago. Situated at the convergence of the north and south branches of the Chicago River, Salesforce Tower Chicago will serve as a beacon of Salesforce’s culture and our values, and a central gathering place for employees, customers, partners, and Trailblazers from around the world. The top two floors in the 57-story office building are dedicated ‘Ohana Floors, spaces for their employees and guests to enjoy during the day, and available for local nonprofits to host fundraising events at night and on weekends at no cost. To date, the company’s ‘Ohana Floors around the world have helped raise more than $108 million for local communities. For Salesforce Tower Chicago, the company has applied all they’ve learned post-pandemic to design spaces for how employees work today. When employees first came back to the office, it was primarily for collaboration, whether it be presentations, team off-sites, or brainstorms. Now that teams are coming in regularly, we’re also hearing that they need space for heads-down, focused work. Throughout the building, the design prioritizes flexibility and employee choice to ensure every individual and team can be successful. The employee floors have been designed to provide focus spaces, like libraries and focus pods, and areas for team collaboration and connection, like event spaces and communal kitchens. These zones are separated acoustically at opposite ends of the floor to support a neurodiverse population and offer more choices for employees. Throughout the workspaces are a mix of mindfulness rooms, pods of height-adjustable desks, and meeting and training rooms. The library spaces provide a variety of individual work settings, including natural light at some seats or, if employees choose, darker spaces with tactile surfaces and task lighting for user control. We’ve doubled the size of the social lounges on our employee floors to allow teams to transform these spaces for bespoke events and use them throughout the day as a working cafe. We’ve also added more conference and training rooms and flexible meeting space, equipped with the latest hybrid-work technology and room layouts to ensure our teams can connect with colleagues and customers around the world. As one of their most sustainable buildings to date, Salesforce Tower Chicago is on track to achieve LEED v4 Gold Certification for the exterior of the building, LEED v4 Platinum for the interiors, and Zero Carbon Certification. The building is also powered by all-electric systems, meaning there is no on-site use of fossil fuels. It is the first building in Chicago to require Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to quantify the embodied carbon emissions of concrete and steel, resulting in a 19% overall reduction in carbon emissions compared to the industry average.

First state approvals secured for Medinah Temple temporary casino,"The Illinois Gaming Board has unanimously approved initial supplier licenses for Bally’s temporary casino at Medinah Temple. As part of their winning casino bid, Bally’s will be operating a temporary casino at Medinah Temple until the full-fledged casino is completed at the site of the current Tribune Freedom Center printing plant. With all city approvals set for the temporary casino and permit issued, the approvals from the Illinois Gaming Board are the final hurdle before the temporary space can open.

Urbanize tours progress at 741 N. Wells,"Urbanize recently toured progress on Vista Property’s latest development in Chicago at 741 N. Wells. Formerly occupied by a one-story retail building and three-story structure, the new tower will rise just off W. Chicago Ave, offset by a historic brick building that will be retained at 755 N.

The building will include 50 studios, 101 one-bedrooms and 17 two-bedrooms, as well as a rooftop terrace with pool, meeting facilities, exercise area, bicycle storage for 150 bikes and parking for 51 cars. With Skender Construction leading the construction for the project and our walkthrough, we began by heading up to the top of the building. With the 19th floor slab poured just a couple days ahead, our tour began on the 18th floor where scaffolding is in place holding up the deck above. Looking out from the building, you can already see the expansive views that future residents will have. Nearby developments visible include JDL Development’s 920 N. Wells at North Union, North Wells Capital’s 311 W. Huron, Sterling Bay’s 360 N. Green in the distance, and Structured Development’s Big Deahl tower rising in the distance further north.  Heading down the building, a few of the floors right below 18 still have pole shores in place as the concrete decks fully cure. Our next stop was the 8th floor, where the facade is being installed. Designed as a window wall system, crews working further ahead install metal tracks on the concrete slabs for window pieces to clip into. Crews lift the individual window wall pieces into place, locking and sealing them as they go.  Working our way down, we stopped briefly on the sixth floor, where framing has been installed around the stairwells and workers have made more progress on installing mechanical systems. Stopping next on the fourth floor, we stepped out onto the roof deck. Residential units that face the fourth floor deck will each get their own private terrace.  Our next stop was the parking garage, which will have parking for 51 cars. The third floor includes space for a dog wash and dog run as a tenant amenity, while the second floor includes a bike room for 150 bikes. As an amenity-focused development, residents will also have access to meeting rooms, a fitness center, and a rooftop terrace with pool once the tower is completed.  Wrapping up the tour, we walked through the ground floor which will have 9,400 square feet of retail space flanking a center residential lobby. Currently, the construction hoist lands right where the entryway will be for residents.  With work progressing quickly, Skender expects to top out the tower later this month and enclose the entire building with glass by late Spring.

While operating as a casino, the main entry will be at the center of the building along N. Wabash Ave. Pedestrian exits will be located at the corners along W. Ohio St and W. Ontario St, with an employee entrance on W. Ohio St. A service and loading access point will be along W. Ontario St. Originally the temporary casino was planned for the waterfront parcel at the northeastern corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St across from the final casino location. The switch to Medinah Temple was made because the current W. Chicago Ave bridge and intersection at W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St are planned to be reconstructed in 2023. This work would cause massive issues for traffic access and would at times fully cut off access to that site. With approval from the Permit Review Committee, the architects will be working on the construction documents and submitting for permits early this fall with construction planned to begin after permits are obtained. Bally’s goal is to open the temporary site early in Summer 2023 and it will run for 24 months, with a 12-month extension possible if needed before the full casino site is opened to the public.

741 N. Wells scores foundation permit,"A foundation permit has been issued for 741 N. Wells. Fronting N. Wells St, the project site reaches to W. Chicago Ave with a historic masonry structure at 755 N. Wells that will be retained. Developed by Vista Property Group, a one-story retail structure and a three-story masonry structure will be demolished for the development.  With a design from Antunovich Associates, the new mixed-use tower will stand 21 floors, holding 169 residential units and 9,400 square feet of retail space. Rising 255 feet, the apartment mix will consist of a mix of studios, one-beds, and two-beds. 51 car parking spaces will be included on the second and third floors, with bike parking provided for 150 bikes. Designed with a contemporary loft vernacular, the building will use floor-to-ceiling glass with a small amount of metal paneling. The front facade will have a subtle serrated edge setting back from the street to allow for wider southern views. To offer relief on the ground floor for outdoor dining, the retail space will setback in line with the building’s setback.  Tenant amenities will include an interior dog run and dog spa, a fitness center, outdoor fitness space, a club room, coworking space, and an outdoor deck with a pool. The existing building at 755 N. Wells will be retained and used for retail and office space. To meet affordability requirements, the project will include five units on site at 60% AMI and a payment of $2.4 million in lieu of the remaining 13 units. The project recently secured a $60 million construction loan according to The Real Deal and work will be starting soon. With Skender in charge of construction, the project is slated for completion in 2024. ",River North,1.0
Bally’s previews look for Medinah Temple temporary casino,"Bally’s Corporation presented their plans for the temporary casino at Medinah Temple to the public earlier this week. As part of their winning casino bid, Bally’s will be operating a temporary casino at Medinah Temple until the full-fledged casino is completed at the site of the current Tribune Freedom Center printing plant. With STL Architects on board for the conversion, the plan looks to renovate the interior while avoiding any building changes to the landmarked exterior. Originally built in 1912 by architects Huel and Schmid, the building was home to the Chicago Shriners and was designed in a Moorish style with extensive ornament that makes it a unique building amongst its surrounding context. Protected by landmark designation, the exterior will remain unchanged with the exception of new signs replacing the old signs. The current signage from Bloomingdale’s will be removed and replaced with Bally’s signage that matches the same configuration and scale.   On the interior, Bloomingdale’s conversion in 2003 saw the filling in of the original 4,200-seat auditorium to create larger floor plates for the store. Since the proscenium was also protected by the landmark status, it was retained and painted white. With SOSH Architects working on the interior, the casino plan will see the removal of most of the interior partitions to open up the floors to casino gaming. Any new walls and rooms on the top floor would be built below the ceiling to keep the coffered ceilings intact. The architects will follow a similar lighting plan from Bloomingdale’s to achieve a low visual impact and embrace the geometry of the original ceiling coffers. While operating as a casino, the main entry will be at the center of the building along N. Wabash Ave. Pedestrian exits will be located at the corners along W. Ohio St and W.

Photos: Urbanize tours the nearly complete One Chicago development,"The expansive One Chicago development is nearly complete and Urbanize got an inside look at the construction. Planned to deliver 735 rental apartments and 77 for-sale condominiums, the two-tower plan is a venture of JDL Development. Located in the heart of River North, the design is a product of collaboration between Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture and Goettsch Partners. Since Urbanize’s last tour, the tower crane is down, glass is up, and the construction hoist has been removed. The tour began along W. Superior St at the building’s motor court, designed for resident loading, pickup, and drop off, as well as parking access.  Loading up in the service elevator, we headed up to the penthouse condominium, a duplex on the 74th and 75th floors. While the entire building has been encased in glass, interior work on the penthouse won’t be completed until it is sold. Interior MEP layouts will be roughed in, with the remaining interior finishes left up to the eventual buyer.  The vistas from the penthouse feature unobstructed views in every direction, with an impressive sight of the John Hancock Tower, now known as 875 N. Michigan. The large exterior terrace sits atop one of the final setbacks facing north. The next stop was the model condominium unit on the 46th floor. Located within the top floors of the 76-story, 971-foot main tower, the 77 condominiums are spread across the levels in quarter-floor units, half-floor homes, and full-floor configurations. The homes are expected to begin closings at the end of April. On the lower floors of the main tower sits the One Chicago Apartments. As the next stop on the tour, Urbanize walked through a three-bedroom rental on the 42nd floor, as well as a one-bedroom rental and two-bedroom unit on the 24th floor. The rentals are currently pre-leasing and expect the first move-ins in mid-March. The next stop of the tour included a walkthrough of model units at 23 West Chicago, the shorter 49-story, 574-foot tower. Dubbed 23 West Apartments, the collection of rental units began move-ins back in October 2021 and offer a range of unit sizes and products. Our tour took us through a one-bedroom apartment and a two-bedroom rental on the 27th floor. Some of these units are offered to tenants as guest suites, available on a nightly basis for family or friends visiting residents of the building. While not part of the tour, the building’s podium is home to a large Whole Foods that is nearing completion. Encompassing multiple floors, the southwestern end of the podium holds a massive Lifetime Fitness Club, offering an outdoor pool deck, indoor/outdoor pool, full-sized NCAA basketball court, and flexible gym space. The podium will also include a Phil’s Coffee at the base of the 23 W. Chicago tower. Restaurant tenants for commercial space along N. State Street will soon be announced. With construction led by Power Construction, the expansive complex is wrapping up work, with all residential products set to be available for lease or closing by the end of April. The Lifetime Fitness Club has been open since the beginning of the New Year and Whole Foods is anticipated to open around March.  ",River North,0.0
Boutique condo building switches back to hotel at 61 W. Erie,"As construction wraps up at 61 W. Erie St, news has broken that the building will be converted into a boutique hotel. Announced via Alderman Reilly’s recent newsletter to constituents, Sonder Hospitality is planning on operating the project as a boutique hotel. The development is currently being managed and constructed by LG Development.  The site has been the subject of a long saga of proposals and scope changes. A 12-story condo building was originally proposed by LG Development in 2017 but failed to get started. In 2019, the developers planned to collaborate with Sonder Hospitality and build a five-story hotel concept with short-term rental suites. In 2020, Sonder backed out due to the coronavirus pandemic upending the hospitality industry and LG Development moved ahead with the units planned as for-sale condos.  With a strong recovery in the hospitality industry, Sonder is reportedly excited to again pursue this location as a boutique hotel. The 28 condos will be now converted into 28 apartment style hotel suites, with ground floor retail remaining unchanged. Sonder will have full time employees and on-site security.  Since the building was constructed under the existing zoning of DX-5, hotel use is permitted as-of right, and no approvals will be necessary for the switch. An official opening date has not been announced. ",River North,0.0
Zoning application introduced for Lawrence Gateway,"A zoning application has been submitted for Lawrence Gateway, a mixed-use development at 2919 W. Lawrence. Proposed by MAS Ventures LLC and Malek Abdulsamad, the mixed-use development is planned for a trapezoidal parcel across the street from Ronan Park. The property currently has a surface parking lot and a one-story masonry building. Designed by Wight & Company, the new mixed-use development will result in a five-story structure set to top out at approximately 61 feet. The project will deliver 40 new residential units, with 32 of them market-rate and the other eight units set aside as affordable. The unit mix will include 7 studios, 15 one-beds, and 18 two-beds.  On the ground floor, the building will have two retail spaces totaling approximately 9,300 square feet, with the residential entry in the middle. Parking for 40 bikes will be included in a bike room inside the building. Residents will also have access to a fifth-floor lounge and outdoor deck that will have views north toward Ronan Park and the Chicago River. The building’s design will consist of a corrugated metal panel facade with light bronze siding over the floor slabs and black window frames. The metal paneling on the retail podium will be a darker bronze. A central staircase at the center of the building’s front facade will be clad in glass and will feature a mural. With sustainability in mind, the project has been designed to meet the city’s sustainability requirements, to earn Energy Star, and to earn Zero Energy Ready Homes standard. The all-electric building will have no gas cooking or heating and will instead feature a VRF heating system and will be solar-ready.  A surface parking lot on the western side of the site will have 19 parking spaces, including 2 handicapped and 2 EV charging spaces. This portion of the site cannot be built on because of a MWRD easement for deep tunnel sewer lines that run through the property. Set back 30 feet from W. Lawrence Ave, the parking lot will use permeable pavers and will be wrapped with landscaping. The landscaping along the street will become a small public space with benches and landscaping planters along W. Lawrence Ave. To allow for the scope of the development, the developers are looking to rezone the site from C1-2 to C1-3. With approval from Alderman Andre Vasquez secured, the introduction of the zoning application at City Hall will lead to review by the Committee on Zoning and City Council. The developers said that they hope to get through the zoning approval process and secure permits to begin construction within the first half of 2024.

Ribbon cutting celebrated for Maria Elena Sifuentes Apartments,"The City of Chicago, Mayor Johnson, Chicago DOH, developer Celadon Partners, the Communities United housing team, and Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez gathered to celebrate the completion of the Maria Elena Sifuentes Apartments located at 3559 W. Lawrence in Albany Park. “Celadon is thrilled to have completed our latest affordable housing development in Chicago’s Albany Park community,” stated Scott Henry CEO of Celadon Partners, “Our mission of providing safe affordable housing options for families in this community was a collaborative effort between Celadon, our community partners ROOTS and Communities United, the City of Chicago Department of Buildings, and our lending partners Huntington Bank.” The Maria Elena Sifuentes Apartments, initially named the Metropolitan Apartments, was selected in the Department of Housing’s (DOH) 2019 funding round. With total development costs at $26.17 million, City assistance comprised 70% of the total project sources. DOH provided $1.6 million in 9% Low Income Housing Tax Credits, as well as $990,000 in Donation Tax Credits, resulting in approximately $15.8 million in total equity for the benefit of this project. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development further issued up to $2.5 million in Tax Increment Financing assistance. “Housing is a fundamental right, and the Maria Elena Sifuentes Apartments exemplify our commitment to ensuring that those who require subsidies to live affordably have just as many choices in where they call home as those who don’t require subsidies,” said Housing Commissioner Jim R. Horan. Designed by UrbanWorks, the newly completed project offers 50 units of affordable housing, with 42 units priced for households earning up to 60% of the Area Median Income and the remaining eight units at market rate. Additionally, 15 of the 42 units are made available to extremely low-income households, thanks to the crucial support of CLIHTF rental subsidies. In addition to providing affordable housing options to the community, the project will prioritize the needs of working families by providing access to a convenient, enriching, and accredited childcare option. Concordia Place – an award-winning, locally-based non-profit daycare provider for resident families and the surrounding community – will occupy the ground floor commercial space, which spans an impressive 6,500 square feet.

Mixed-use development proposed at 3318 W. Montrose,"A mixed-use development has been proposed at 3318 W. Montrose. Planned by Yuriy Chvyrenko, the development would occupy a vacant site at the northeast corner of the intersection of W. Montrose Ave and N. Christiana Ave. Designed by Hanna Architects, the new construction would consist of a four-story building. The ground floor would host 2,720 square feet of commercial space along W. Montrose Ave, with the residential entrance around the corner on N. Christiana Ave. The rest of the ground floor would be occupied by 24 parking spaces in an interior garage. The upper three floors of the building would have 24 residential units, with five of them set aside as affordable. With eight apartments per floor, all of the rentals will be two-bedroom layouts with private balconies and in-unit laundry. The market-rate units are expected to rent for $1,850-$2,100 per month and the affordable units will rent for $1,150-$1,280 per month. Topping out at 55 feet tall, the building’s ground floor will be enclosed with dark gray brick and glass. The upper floors will be framed with white stucco and infilled with a mix of brick, glass, and black metal paneling. The building will be topped by a shared rooftop deck for residents. The development will be an electric building with heat pumps and induction stoves, will provide 6 bike parking spaces, a green roof, permeable pavers, EV charging stations, and native plantings. To allow for the scope of the development, the site would need a rezoning from B3-1 to B2-3.

Permits issued for mixed-use affordable housing project,"Permits were issued for the construction of a mixed-use affordable housing project at 3557 W Lawrence Avenue. Located in Albany Park, the building was permitted under the address of 3559 W Lawrence Avenue. The plot is a corner site at the intersection of Lawrence and Central Park Avenues. Chicago-based Celadon Holdings, LLC is the developer behind the venture. Funded in part by $2.5 million in TIF money, the new building will rise 65 feet with 50 units spread between its six floors. With a design from UrbanWorks, 42 units will be designated as affordable, with the remaining 8 positioned as unrestricted workforce units, serving families at 80% AMI.

The design of the proposal comes from local architecture firm 360 Design Studio and calls for a masonry facade, outdoor terraces, and improvements to the public way. Each of the six-unit buildings will include a detached garage at the rear with enclosed parking for six vehicles. If approved, the team aims to begin construction on the condo complex at 3030 W.

Affordable apartments in Albany Park take key steps forward,"In Albany Park, a plan to replace a longtime vacant lot with a 50-unit affordable housing development is closer to becoming a reality on the heels of two key city approvals. At February’s Zoning Board of Appeals meeting, the property at 3557 W. Lawrence Avenue received a variance for the proposed six-story building. And last week, the project got another boost when the city’s Community Development Commission voted to set aside $2.5 million in tax increment financing (TIF). Developed by Celadon Holdings, the roughly $16 million project—known as the Metropolitan Apartments—will create 42 new affordable rental units targeting families at 15 percent, 30 percent, and 60 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Eight apartments will be designed as “workforce” housing targeting families at 80 percent AMI. The new structure, designed by Chicago-based UrbanWorks, will rise to a height of 73 feet and offer exterior space for local artists to paint murals, according to Block Club Chicago. The transit-oriented project will take advantage of the site’s proximity to the CTA Brown Line and provide on-site parking for 13 cars and 50 bicycles. The plan also calls for the building’s first-floor retail space will be occupied by the nonprofit organization Concordia Place, which will provide free or low-cost childcare for residents. The TIF funding will still need to go before the Chicago City Council for final approval, and the developers must secure building permits before construction can begin.

With 18 residential units in the building, 16 of them will be two-beds and two will be three-bed configurations. 14 of them would’ve been rented at market-rate, with the other four set aside as affordable. A parking garage at the back of the ground floor would include nine car parking spaces and nine bike parking spaces.  The building’s design includes a palette of materials that references the neighborhood and the Picasso sculpture downtown. The facade’s white brick portion relates to the adjacent building on W. Balmoral Ave, while the red brick corners relate to the building to the north of the site on N. Ashland Ave. The corten steel will clad the upper floors, bringing in something new and sharp into the material palette of the neighborhood. The development was planning to include green building features, such as green roofs with native plantings, LED light fixtures with timers and motion sensors, high efficiency HVAC and appliances, EV charging stations, composting, and the infrastructure for the building to be converted all-electric in the future. The developer was asking to rezone the site from RS-3 to B2-3, but Alderman Vasquez denied the change, citing neighbors' concern for its height and density, its design, and for not having enough affordable units in the building. Vasquez said in a statement that he will be having a follow up meeting with the community to discuss the lack of affordable housing in the area and encouraged the developer to meet with neighbors and address their concerns, encouraging a proposal that would be more aesthetically in line with the neighborhood and at least one floor shorter.

Community reacts to proposed development at 5400 N. Ashland,"A residential development is being proposed at 5400 N. Ashland. Planned by real estate investor Josh Bradley, the project site is located at the northwest corner of N. Ashland Ave and W. Balmoral Ave. Owned for 30 years by the Gillis family, the site had a proposed 7-unit condo project that was rejected back in 2020. In 2021, the existing home on the site was purchased by someone who renovated the interior and resold it. Bradley and his husband bought the home and property in October 2022. Designed by Compass Architecture LLC, the new construction building will be a five-story structure topping out at 57 feet tall. With 18 residential units in the building, 16 of them will be two-beds and two will be three-bed configurations. The developer is planning to rent 14 of them at market-rate, with the other four set aside as affordable. A parking garage at the back of the ground floor will include nine car parking spaces and nine bike parking spaces.  The building’s design includes a palette of materials that references the neighborhood and the Picasso sculpture downtown. The facade’s white brick portion relates to the adjacent building on W. Balmoral Ave, while the red brick corners relate to the building to the north of the site on N. Ashland Ave. The Corten steel will clad the upper floors, bringing in something new and sharp into the material palette of the neighborhood. The development is planning to include green building features, such as green roofs with native plantings, LED light fixtures with timers and motion sensors, high efficiency HVAC and appliances, EV charging stations, composting, and the infrastructure for the building to be converted all-electric in the future. After the presentation, Bradley talked through different elements in the project that are under consideration and development. While the design currently has the garage access via a curb cut on W. Balmoral Ave, the architecture team is looking at switching access to the alley. The team is looking at removing the brick arches at the porches and offsetting the plane of the corten steel based on community feedback prior to the meeting. They are also looking to reduce the visibility of the rooftop stair and to make the building as sustainable as possible. Some neighbors were concerned about the parking count in the building, with nine spaces for the 14 units. The development team explained how the site is a transit-served location and falls within the TOD requirements, allowing for a reduction in parking. The team referenced statistics that households in TOD areas are twice as likely not to own a car and carless residents are more likely to frequent local businesses. Some neighbors expressed support for the reduced parking count. Some neighbors also took issue with the scale of the project, asking the development team if they could move forward with a three-story building. The development team responded that that would be a substantial deviation from the plan, and the proposal as it stands has a very specific proforma to make rentals with affordable units work. Going to three floors would damage this plan and would reduce the ability to include affordable units which they felt would be a mistake. Many neighbors expressed positive reactions to the proposed density. To allow for the scope of the development, the developers are looking to rezone the site from RS-3 to B2-3. Before heading to City Hall for approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council, Alderman Andre Vasquez of the 40th Ward will need to approve of the project. The developer reported that they currently plan to start construction at the end of 2024 or early 2025 with a 15-month construction timeline. ",Andersonville,0.0

Four-story residential project headed to Andersonville,"Construction is imminent on a 13-unit residential development at 1765 W. Rosehill Drive in the Andersonville neighborhood, according to a recent building permit issued to Chicago-based Candea Development. The four-story-plus-basement structure would rise just west of Candea's four-story, 39-unit condo development at 1743 W. Rosehill (also known as 5748 N. Hermitage). The development replaces a low-rise commercial site that previously housed Jeron Electronic Systems and a parking lot. Candea purchased the property for $2.6 million in 2017, RE Journals reported. Designed by Compass Architecture LLC , the upcoming 13-unit building features a masonry facade, an elevator, several large balconies, and a rooftop deck based on a rendering posted by Compass. It's unclear if the project at 1765 W. Rosehill Drive will be offered as rentals or condos. A for-sale product seems more likely given Candea's track record in the area and the fact that the development will include an attached 13-car garage. The permit lists Rainmaker Real Estate Holdings as the project's general contractor.

Sterling Bay closes on industrial site at 4510 W. Ann Lurie,"Sterling Bay has announced its successful closing on the purchase of 4510 W Ann Lurie Place, a 7.5-acre land parcel in Chicago’s Archer Heights neighborhood. The acquisition was made in partnership with Affinius Capital, with a construction loan from First National Bank of Omaha. The firm plans to develop a 147,500 square foot industrial facility on site to meet the city’s increasing demand for modern industrial space. This project further solidifies the company’s commitment to expanding its portfolio into new verticals outside of creative office, including industrial, life sciences and residential. The development at 4510 W Ann Lurie Place will be constructed by PREMIER Design + Build Group, featuring ten loading bays, two drive-in doors, and 101 vehicles parking spaces. Notably, the LEED Silver-certified facility will support sustainable operations, with EV charging stations to promote eco-friendly transit, upgraded steel components for future solar panel integration, and native landscaping to enhance the exterior environment. “This project reflects our unwavering belief in the power of real estate development to contribute to the betterment of our city,” said Andy Gloor, CEO at Sterling Bay. “By prioritizing strategic urban planning, innovative design, and sustainable practices, like we’ve done here at 4510 W Ann Lurie Place, we aim to develop spaces that foster economic growth, create job opportunities, and enhance community resilience across Chicago.” 4510 W Ann Lurie Place is set to break ground later this year, creating upwards of 35 full-time jobs once fully occupied. As part of its commitment to engaging local minority and women-owned businesses across its portfolio, Sterling Bay has committed to adhere to the city of Chicago’s MWBE Program at 4510 W Ann Lurie Place, which sets goals for MWBE participation at twenty-six percent and six percent, respectively.

Skender begins work on Greater Chicago Food Depository expansion,"Skender has commenced construction on a 37,000 square-foot expansion of the Greater Chicago Food Depository. Located at 4100 W. Ann Lurie, the non-profit organization provides food for families and individuals at risk of food insecurity while advancing a mission to end hunger.  To aid in the Food Depository’s goal to produce and distribute 2.5 million prepared meals annually to community members, the new structure will expand the light industrial facility to include a commercial kitchen for meal preparation and packaging, and a demonstration kitchen for nutrition education. With architects Partners by Design in charge of the design, the project also includes 11.5 acres of site work with parking for volunteers, guests and fleet, as well as space for growing fresh produce in the future. “The Greater Chicago Food Depository is excited to move forward with Skender on this transformational project,” said Kate Maehr, Executive Director and CEO of the Food Depository. “This expansion of our facility will directly result in more healthy prepared meals for our neighbors at increased risk of hunger, including older adults, people with disabilities, individuals with medical conditions, and other households. We look forward to the day the first meals are produced in our new commercial kitchen and delivered to households across our community. This is a vital step in our mission to end hunger.” In 2019, the organization completed an initial phase of upgrades, which expanded cold storage, upgraded the existing warehouse, and created new and renovated spaces for their volunteer program. The first phase renovations have been essential throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as demand for food assistance soared to record levels. As the need for prepared meals is projected to increase dramatically, this latest expansion will allow the Food Depository to reach target populations who have experienced unique barriers to food access during the pandemic, now and in the future. The new phase will also include a community partnership strategy that aims to increase the total number of healthy meals distributed by purchasing meals from local minority and women-owned businesses and community organizations. Driven by a $75 million capital campaign, construction of the new facility is expected to reach completion in early 2024. ",Archer Heights,0.0
City Council approves Greater Chicago Food Depository expansion,"The City Council has approved plans to expand the existing Greater Chicago Food Depository building at 4100 W. Ann Lurie Pl. Located in Archer Heights, the existing facility sits on an 880,00 square-foot site that spans from W. 40th St down to W. Ann Lurie Pl. along S. Keeler Ave. As part of the project, the organization will acquire the parking lot across the street and vacate S. Keeler Ave.  As a non-profit organization fighting hunger since 1978, the Greater Chicago Food Depository has been headquartered at the location since 2004. The current 268,000 square-foot building holds administration space, volunteer programming space, training areas, a warehouse, and a distribution space. Currently the facility needs more cold storage capacity and increased meal prep space. With Partners by Design as the architect behind the project, the new expansion and addition will add 36,700 square feet of space that will create a new meal prep facility as well as a new lobby and administrative space. The new facade will be made up mostly of precast concrete panels, while the new entry will be clad with a glass curtain wall. Panelized wood cladding with backlit signage for the organization will help to announce the new entry point. As part of the project, the newly expanded site will allow for 224 new parking spaces, bringing the total car parking spaces to 337 spots. S. Keeler Ave is vacated but will become an inner roadway for truck traffic that comes off of W. 40th St. Site detention spaces will be located at the northwest and south ends of the site, while an open green space will be left for a potential urban farm envisioned for the future.   With City Council approval, the development has now received a full greenlight from the city and can proceed with work on-site. According to a recent Chicago Sun-Times article, the facility is planning to be fully operational by late 2023. ",Archer Heights,0.0
The Chicago architectural legacy of the late great Helmut Jahn,"On Sunday, Chicago and the world lost one of its architectural greats. Helmut Jahn, a titan of postmodern design and larger-than-life personality, was tragically killed Saturday in a cycling crash near suburban St. Charles. The architect was 81 years old. It's impossible to tell Helmut Jahn's story without Chicago. Born in Germany in 1940, Helmut Jahn graduated from the Technische Hochschule in Munich and emigrated to the Windy City in 1966 to attend the Illinois Institute of Technology. Although he never graduated, Jahn did return to IIT in 2003 to design a dormitory building on the school's near south side campus.  Helmut joined Chicago architecture firm C. F. Murphy and Associates in 1967 and rose to the position of executive vice president and director of planning and design. Jahn took over the company in 1981 and renamed it Murphy/Jahn. The firm, which maintains offices in the Loop's historic Jewelers Building, was rebranded as simply JAHN in 2012. The company also has offices in Shanghai and Berlin. In the 1970s, Jahn joined up with the architectural ""Chicago Seven,"" a countercultural cohort of local designers that rejected the rigid monotony of the International Style pioneered by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and others. Although Jahn embraced the out-of-the-box attitude of his iconoclastic colleagues like Stanley Tigerman, Laurence Booth, and Thomas Beeby, his work could still trace its roots back to his old teacher and his uniquely Chicago brand of Modernism. ""Helmut was this dashing star of an architect,"" former Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin recently told the newspaper. ""He was on the cover of GQ. He was renowned as much for his persona as for his architecture, but his architecture was always exceptional. And, as time went on, he was regarded as less of a 'Flash Gordon' character and more of a modernist master."" Jahn went on to leave his mark on cities across the globe and reshaped New York's skyline in the process. In Chicago, Jahn continued to showcase his versatility. He teamed up with architect Gene Summers to create the boxy low-slung, Mies van der Rohe-esque Lakeside Center at McCormick Place as well as the glassy domelike Joe and Rika Mansueto Library at the University of Chicago. For international visitors, a first—and in many cases only—experience of Chicago occurs at O'Hare International Airport. Here, Jahn created an iconic mirrored neon-lined tunnel connecting the two concourses of the United Terminal. A Blue Line station with undulating glass-block walls backed by multicolor lighting serves as the airport's mass transit gateway. Even the concourse itself playfully evokes both the glass-topped train sheds of Victorian Europe and the inside of an airplane's wing, supported by rib-like structural spars.  Architecture critic Paul Goldberger tweeted, ""Shocked and saddened by the sudden death of Helmut Jahn, who was a pivotal figure in the evolution of Chicago modernism in the second half of the 20th century. His United terminal at O’Hare remains among the great airport buildings."" Jahn's biggest impact on the Chicago skyline—an 800-plus-foot residential tower called 1000M—remains a work in progress. The developers of the high-rise slated for 1000 S. Michigan Avenue were forced to pause foundation work during the pandemic, but they hope to soon restart construction by switching its condominium residences to easier-to-finance rental units.   ""I am extremely saddened by the loss of Helmut Jahn who I have had the privilege of working with for the last 15 years on multiple projects,"" said Francis Greenburger in a statement to Urbanize Chicago on behalf of the development team for 1000 S. Michigan. ""He was clearly one of the great architects of his time and has left his imprint and legacy around the world. My heartfelt sympathies and condolences to his wife and family. He will be greatly missed but we look forward to carrying his legacy forward with the completion of 1000M."" Jahn's hometown is also home to undoubtedly the biggest cliffhanger looming over the architect's impressive body of work: the fate of Chicago's threatened James R. Thompson Center. Completed in 1985 as the State of Illinois Building, the city block-sized structure was an audacious vision of what a government building could look like.  Resembling a salmon and baby blue-hued spaceship that touched down in the heart of the Loop, the James R. Thompson Center was always going to be a controversial building. The site's 17-story atrium evokes the grand gestures of traditional public spaces like 19th-century train stations.... or is a giant and inefficient waste of space, depending on who you ask.   Stuck in an architectural no man's land between being too new to be considered ""classic"" and too dated to appeal to contemporary tastes, postmodernism buildings like the Thompson Center don't make an easy case for preservation. An estimated $300 million deferred maintenance bill certainly doesn't do the JRTC any favors either. Last month, the State of Illinois officially put the building up for sale. A city ordinance to rezone the site at 100 W. Randolph to allow for the construction of a skyscraper as high as 100 stories is working its way through the City Council. Will Helmut's unfortunate passing help efforts to save this unusual albeit neglected masterpiece? Only time will tell, but it's looking like a long shot. If there is a silver lining to this weekend's tragedy, it may be that Helmut Jahn won't be present to witness the Thompson Center's demise. Rest in peace, Helmut Jahn. ",Architecture,0.0

CDC approves $15 million in TIF for 838 W. 79th  ,"The Community Development Commission has approved $15 million in TIF financing for a mixed-use development planned for 79th St in Auburn Gresham. Planned by Imagine Group and Evergreen Real Estate Group, the proposal was the winning bid of the Auburn Gresham Invest South/West RFP. Originally one site at 838 W 79th St, the project has evolved and expanded to include another city-owned site at 757 W 79th St.  With Ross Barney Architects leading the design, the project has undergone many changes as a result of feedback from the community. In its final iteration, the building at the original site of 838 W 79th St will stand three floors holding 28 units and 28 parking spaces. The ground floor will also offer ground floor retail space to bring retailers to this area and create jobs.  At 757 W 79th St, the newly proposed four-story building will hold 30 residential units and offer ground floor commercial space. All of the residential apartments in both buildings will be designated as affordable at up to 60% AMI.  As reported by the city planning department, the city-owned land at 838 W 79th St has been vacant for over 20 years and 757 W 79th St has been vacant since the city performed an emergency demolition in 2012.  The $40 million project is being financed through numerous streams including $17 million in LIHTC equity, $15 million in TIF, $1 million in a mortgage, $3 million from the State of Illinois DCEO, as well as other sources.

Auburn Gresham Metra station takes key step forward,"After years of planning—and funding-related delays—the Auburn Park Metra station is one step closer to becoming a reality in the Auburn Gresham community on Chicago's South Side.  This week, Metra's board of directors awarded a $28.2 million construction contract to John Burns Construction. The new station has been under discussion since at least 2009. Local officials joined Metra for a groundbreaking ceremony in 2019, but actual work has yet to begin. The transit agency put the project out to bid in May. The upcoming station will be located southeast corner of 79th Street and Lowe Avenue and service Metra's Rock Island Line. The site plan calls for a landscaped plaza with bicycle racks and benches, an 80-space parking lot, and an elevated platform accessed by stairs and elevators. Metra tapped T.Y. Lin International to design the facility.  The project will restore commuter rail service to the area around 79th Street, which has been without a station since the Rock Island Railroad closed in 1978 and was absorbed by the Regional Transit Agency (RTA). Preliminary work on the station will begin this fall and ramp-up in early 2022.

City selects team for mixed-use affordable development in Auburn Gresham,"A team has been selected to revitalize a vacant tract of land in Auburn Gresham on Chicago’s South Side. The estimated $19.4 million project, which is part of the city’s innovative INVEST South/West initiative, will create a new five-story building with approximately 56 units of affordable housing near the intersection of Halsted and 79th streets. Known as Auburn Gardens, the development comes from Evergreen Imagine JV LLC, which consists of developers Evergreen Real Estate Group and Imagine Group and the design firms of Carol Ross Barney and NIA Architecture.  Like all INVEST South/West winners so far, Auburn Gardens will be mixed-use. It is targeting a restaurant and an athletic goods retailer for its ground-floor retail space. “Projects on major commercial corridors form the heart of a neighborhood,” said David Block, director of development with Evergreen. “Just building housing isn’t enough. You need to invest time, energy, and money into revitalizing these corridors.”  Block says that he sees Evergreen’s Auburn Gresham project replicating the same kind of success the company experienced with its recent Independence Apartments and Northtown Apartments which “co-located” affordable housing atop new Chicago Public Library branches.  “You bring activity to the street level and it's reinforced by the people living upstairs,” said Block. “Chicago originally developed that way, with the ‘living above the store’ model, and we think there’s still some wisdom in that.” The project at 838 W. 79th Street will likely use some of the more conventional tools for financing affordable housing such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits and funding from the area’s existing tax increment financing (TIF) district.  Other projects included in the first round of INVEST South/West were a community ‘eco-food hub’ in Englewood and the adaptive reuse and expansion of Austin’s former Laramie Bank building into 72 units of mixed-income housing and a blues museum.

Chicago Ave and N. Lawler Ave, the community investment is being led by Stone CDC and Lurie’s Children’s Hospital. With a shared vision of a healing, welcoming space for youth and families to seek clinical care and community-based services, the facility will provide high-quality pediatric specialty physical and behavioral healthcare services; community-responsive health education and training; gathering space for youth development and other community organizations; and outdoor space for programming and respite. Designed by Gregory Ramon Design Studio and TnS Studio, the new three-story structure will have approximately 25,000 square feet of space. The interior will include a medical service clinic and treatment facility for Lurie’s Children’s Hospital and a mixed-use space with a cafe, restaurant, offices, and community meeting and event space for Stone CDC. Topping out at 55 feet, the building’s design consists of a colorful facade made of fiber cement paneling and brick. The site will include 15 parking spaces for visitors and employees.  With City Council approval secured, the site will be rezoned from RS-3 and B3-1 to a unified B3-3. Construction is expected to begin in Spring 2024 with completion set for Spring 2025. ",Austin,0.0
Preliminary landmark approved for Mars Candy Factory,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for the Mars Candy Factory in Austin. Located at 2019 N. Oak Park, the factory was originally built in 1929 by The Austin Company with a contributing addition from 1960 by C.F. Murphy Associates. Meeting Criterion 1 for heritage, the factory benefitted from Chicago’s status as the center of the country’s railroad network. Set up next to the railroad tracks, train cars could be diverted via spurs to bring fresh goods onto the site. When the factory was built, only scattered parcels around it were developed, but the facility became an asset to the neighborhood and workers chose to live in the area. The building has been the headquarters and main production facility for decades, with the factory producing some of the nation’s most popular candy for almost a century, starting with the Milky Way. At its busiest, the facility had 10 production lines and 2500 people employed. The facility also meets Criterion 3 for its association with a significant person. Frank C. Mars founded the company in 1911 and the factory was a result of his desire to build the most beautiful candy factory in America. Forrest Mars Sr, Frank's son, worked with him in the early 1930s and helped to create Snickers, Three Musketeers, and M&M’s.   Also meeting Criterion 4, the factory is constructed in the Spanish Revival style, reflected in the distinctive low pitch clay tile roofs, compound hipped and gable roofs of varying heights, and arched window and door openings. The central tower with pyramidal roof is the primary one, but small tower shapes extend above the north elevation roofline as well as above the roofline of the north wing.  The final criterion is Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect. The original part was built by the Austin Company, which was founded in 1878. Globally known as the innovator in industrial facility design and construction, it was the one of the earliest companies to offer the whole suite of design, engineering, and construction services in one entity, eliminating high cost. The 1960 addition was designed by C.F. Murphy Associates, one of Chicago’s most prominent mid-20th century architects.  Although the factory has had dozens of additions over the years, the factory still meets the Integrity Criterion because the additions have been built on the rear and have not had a significant impact on the historical and architectural features. Alterations to the historic portion include the replacement of windows and doors as well as the clay roof tiles.  The commission outlines the significant features of the factory as all exterior elevations including rooflines measuring back seven bays from the facade at a depth of approximately 133 feet, stretching from the north elevation down to the south elevation along W. Armitage Ave. The iron gate and brick posts will also be considered significant.   For purposes of permit review, if any non-significant portions are demolished, the commission will require that a new masonry east wall be constructed to enclose and make the significant portion of the building weather tight. The loading dock and the south elevation is not considered significant and may be modified. With the preliminary designation approved, the commission will prepare a report before voting on a final landmark recommendation. If approved, the proposed designation would be sent to City Hall for approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. During the hearing, a representative from Mars stated that they are in favor of the landmarking and any developer that acquires the site would include the significant building in its redevelopment plan.

CTA awards contract for Austin Green Line improvements,"The Chicago Transit Authority will soon begin a major renovation of the Austin Green Line station, including the addition of an elevator and other improvements to make the station fully accessible to those who use mobility devices as part of the CTA’s All Stations Accessibility Program (ASAP). The Chicago Transit Board recently approved the awarding of a contract not to exceed $15.3 million to John Burns Construction Company, LLC following a competitive procurement process. Funding for this critical infrastructure project was sourced through the federal government’s Surface Transportation Program (STP) and Governor Pritzker’s Rebuild Illinois Capital Plan.  STP funds provided $20.3M in funding and Rebuild Illinois provided $5.3M to this project for a total budget of $25.6M. “The CTA has made it a priority to collaborate with the disability community to pursue a vision of 100% accessibility for all customers,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr., “Awarding this contract for the Austin Green Line, we are able to take another step forward to realize the goal of making all stations 100% accessible, while also seeking opportunities to invest in the Austin community on our city’s West Side.   The original street level station opened in 1899 and has not been upgraded since it was rebuilt in 1962. The work at the Austin Green Line station will include fully reconstructing the main station house at 351 N. Austin Blvd, which upon completion will feature a new elevator and escalator that connects the station house to the platform above, in addition to a new ADA accessible ramp, new stairs and a platform extension. Details regarding the timeline of project work, including start and completion dates, will be announced at a later date. Under the leadership of CTA President Carter, the ASAP Strategic Plan was released in 2018, which serves as a blueprint for making all rail stations fully accessible by 2038. Currently 103 of CTA’s 145 rail stations (70%) are ADA accessible. With this announcement, 14 stations are currently funded and in various stages of planning and design or under construction.

City breaks ground on Aspire Center,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined Alderman Chris Taliaferro, Department of Planning and Development (DPD) Commissioner Maurice Cox, and representatives from Austin Coming Together (ACT), West Side Health Authority, BMO, and United Way of Metro Chicago for a groundbreaking ceremony for the Aspire Center in Austin. The $40.9M Invest South/West project is being led by Westside Health Authority, Austin Coming Together, and the Jane Addams Resource Corp., and it is supported by $12.25M in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) assistance approved by City Council last month. The Aspire Center will be housed in the former Robert Emmet Elementary School, a 69,100-square-foot building at 5500 W. Madison Ave., which closed in 2013.   “When I first took office as Mayor, I made a commitment to Chicago residents that my administration would direct City resources back into neighborhoods that had been overlooked for decades,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “My INVEST South/West initiative was born out of that commitment, and today’s groundbreaking is the latest example of how my team has executed that vision. The programs and services that the Aspire Center offers will unlock countless career opportunities for Austin residents and support local entrepreneurs who want to create new businesses or expand existing businesses in this community. I look forward to seeing the day that Austin’s potential is fully realized, and I know that the Aspire Center’s presence here will hasten the arrival of that day.”   With Lamar Johnson Collaborative serving as the architect, the Aspire Center will be a multi-use facility that includes an advanced manufacturing training center, small business incubator, community hub, and event space. Specific on-site services are planned to include job readiness and vocational training, financial coaching, and employment services. The project is anticipated to create 50 permanent jobs and train more than 2,000 workers over the next five years. In December 2022, the West Side Health Authority’s POPFit! community plaza opened on a portion of the three-acre property shared by the Aspire Center through a $500,000 DPD Chicago Recovery Plan grant. The Aspire Center was selected to receive city support through the Department of Planning and Development’s (DPD) Community Development Grant program. Austin Coming Together will operate a walk-in community hub in the new center to provide resources to anyone in need. Darrel Hackett, President, BMO Wealth Management-U.S., joined Mayor Lightfoot at the groundbreaking to celebrate the bank’s partnership with the city in supporting INVEST South/West projects. In addition to city support through the allocation of TIF funds, State Representative La Shawn K. Ford worked to secure $10M in state funds for the Aspire Center when the project was in its early stages.   Initial construction on the future Aspire Center is currently underway and the project is expected to reach completion in late 2024.   ",Austin,0.0
Full building permit issued for 5200 W. Chicago,"Austin United Alliance has received a full building permit for the new residential building at 5200 W. Chicago. Planned by Heartland Housing Alliance and Oak Park Regional Housing Center, the project won the Austin Invest South/West RFP issued by the city. With Valerio Dewalt Train Associates in charge of the residential building, the L-shaped design will rise six floors, directly west of the Laramie State Bank. Matching the height and width of the bank’s frontage on its western end of the L-shaped massing, the building will be accented with white frame elements overlooking W. Chicago Ave. At the ground floor, a conference room will face the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Latrobe Ave, while a community room will face out onto the outdoor courtyard space. Between the two, the residential entry will front W. Chicago Ave. An indoor bike room for 43 bikes will have a direct entry from the exterior along N. Latrobe Ave. The rest of the ground floor will hold 28 parking spaces under the northern wing of the building. Rising 80 feet tall, the mixed-income building will host a total of 78 units, split into 51 affordable units and 27 market-rate units.

5200 W. Chicago breaks ground,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot joined city leaders, local community, philanthropic, and corporate partners to commemorate the three-year anniversary of INVEST South/West by breaking ground on Austin United Alliance, a new mixed-use development at 5200 W. Chicago. Planned by Heartland Housing Alliance and Oak Park Regional Housing Center, the project won the Austin Invest South/West RFP issued by the city. The $47 million development will see the construction of a six-story, 78 unit mixed-income building designed by Valerio Dewalt Train Associates. Sited adjacent to the historic Laramie State Bank Building, the bank will see an overhaul and restoration led by Latent Design and Bauer Latoza Studio. The design calls for a new bank branch, cafe, Blues Museum, and office/coworking space. With construction imminent, completion is targeted for 2024. ""Thanks to the $2.2 billion in investment commitments from the public and private sectors since the fall of 2019, INVEST South/West is ready to expand its reach beyond retail districts to include nearby residential blocks that are vital to sustainable neighborhood growth,"" said Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot. ""We will soon say goodbye to the pervasive vacant lots across the South and West Sides and say hello to new two-flats, three-flats, and other walk-up structures that have been home to Chicago families for generations. As I look forward to this next phase in INVEST South/West, I am grateful for the Citywide collaboration and commitment that has already brought incredible transformations to our communities.""  As part of the event, Lightfoot announced new initiatives within Invest South/West that will expand the focus from commercial corridor investments to smaller infill developments on the approximately 5,600 city-owned vacant lots within the neighborhoods. Dubbed Come Home, the first will support the construction of single-family homes, townhouses and small multi-unit buildings on residential blocks within Auburn Gresham, Bronzeville, East Garfield Park, Englewood, Humboldt Park, and Woodlawn. This will launch in late November 2022 with a nationwide Chicago Architecture Center contest that establishes modern design typologies to be built by emerging development firms and made available for affordable home buyers.   The next initiative, called Ready Build, will make concept plans available for corner lot redevelopments with ground floor stores and apartments above. These packages will include concept architectural drawings, cost estimates, and other pre-development materials to help emerging, minority-led development firms get new projects off the ground in the South and west side neighborhoods.  The final offering, BlockBuilder, will serve as an online portal that streamlines the sale of surplus City of Chicago properties to private buyers. More than 80% of the 2,000 vacant lots to initially be made available through the portal’s launch this year are located within INVEST South/West communities.   In addition to the public and private investment, CDOT is spending roughly $280 million in streetscape improvements within the Invest South/West corridors. Encompassing 20 miles of arterial streets, the projects will include infrastructure, pedestrian safety, and placemaking improvements. Construction on the Austin streetscape along W. Chicago Ave is expected to be completed in phases with full completion expected by the end of 2025. ",Austin,0.0

Landmarks approves rehab at 5200 W. Chicago,"The Permit Review Committee has approved plans for the rehabilitation of the Laramie State Bank Building at 5200 W. Chicago. Planned as part of the Austin United Alliance proposal that won the Austin Invest South/West RFP, the building will be renovated and restored as part of the development. The development is being led by Heartland Housing Alliance and Oak Park Regional Housing Center. As reviewed by the landmarks division, the historic Laramie State Bank Building will be restored and reopened to the public with a new bank, cafe, Blues Museum, and office/coworking space. Led by Latent Design, the new design will redevelop the interior of the main banking hall and upper floors. Currently in the state of an architectural ruin, the main lobby space will have a restored coffered ceiling under which the new programs of cafe, Blues Museum exhibit, and a new bank branch will be housed. With Bauer Latoza Studio on the team leading the restoration effort, the building will see many exterior repairs as well. Currently, the exterior terracotta is in poor condition and is serelt cracked with many missing sections. The restoration will refurbish the existing terracotta and replace any pieces that cannot be retained. Existing windows will be replaced with new ones that will match the profile of the current windows. Designed by Valerio Dewalt Train Associates, the overall development will produce a six-story residential building. Rising 69 feet, the structure will hold 76 residential units, 30 vehicle parking spaces, 55 bike stalls, and various tenant amenities. The apartment mix includes 36 one-bedrooms, 35 two-bedrooms, and five three-bedroom rentals. Amenities include an outdoor rooftop deck, fitness room, computer room, social space on each floor and a community room on the ground floor intended for events and social gatherings. The design of the proposal looks to refer to the historic bank building in its design while suggesting a new future of development and activity for the neighborhood. The team is looking to create a catalyst for the neighborhood that sparks innovation, activates the area with a pedestrian-focused scale, and prioritizes the local community including through the establishment of a community-based non-profit board that will manage the reused bank building.  The new construction and former bank building will create a U-shape on the site, leaving the center middle portion open for a public plaza and green space. The plaza will be the fabric that connects new and old together and to the public. Pavings will extend into the sidewalk to welcome the public, while rotating screens will close off at night for residential access only. Public art will be featured on the screened gates as well as on the large blank wall of the bank building. The exterior space will offer green lawn spaces and plantings as well as seating opportunities and small areas to gather.  With this approval from the Permit Review Committee, the project team has the clearance from this division as part of their approval process. The development will go before the Community Development Commission this week to approve the land sale to the developer.

Seth Warner House landmarking sent to City Council,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation to the City Council for the Seth Warner House. Located at 631 N. Central Avenue, the home was originally constructed in 1869 for successful businessman Seth Warner who was one of the earliest settlers in Chicago. Active abolitionist and music patron, Mr. Warner owned a downtown music hall that was often home to anti-slavery events. As defined by Commission on Chicago Landmarks staff, the home meets three defining criteria. Criterion 1, Critical Part of Cities History, applies due to the history of the house as part of Chicago’s early history when Austin was a rural settlement. The home was converted into a hotel during the World's Columbian Exposition and then was later home to the Austin Academy of Fine Arts. Today, the home is back to being used as a personal residence.  Criterion 3, for Significant Person, references Seth Warner, who, as a successful businessman and early settler of Chicago, is a significant figure in Chicago’s history. The final applicable criterion is Criterion 4, for Important Architecture. The home is an early example of the Italianate style which dominated American residential architecture from 1850 to 1880.   The Integrity Criterion applies as the house’s roof lines were changed overtime but restored during the 1980s. While the home’s setting has changed from rural settlement to urban neighborhood, the structure has remained in its original location.  The landmark designation will define all significant features to be protected as all exterior elevations including rooflines. With final landmark recommendation from the commission, the designation will go through approvals at City Hall including the Committee on Zoning and ultimately the full Chicago City Council.

New renderings: Austin's Laramie Bank redevelopment gets updated design,"The team behind a proposal to preserve and expand the neglected Laramie State Bank building in Austin presented revised renderings of their West Side project to Chicago's newly formed Committee on Design. Under the plan, Austin United Alliance would transform the 1920s-era Art Deco structure at 5200 W. Chicago Avenue back into a bank plus a cafe space, business incubator, and a museum dedicated to blues music. Vacant land to the west would support a six-story addition containing 76 residential units, 30 parking spaces, a roof deck, and a publicly accessible plaza. The most recent images from architects Valerio Dewalt Train Associates and Latent Design show minor refinements to the development's architecture and programming compared to what the developers submitted to the city's INVEST South/West design competition earlier in the year. The most notable change is to the addition's western end, which was resized to better match the dimensions of the existing bank. ""Since [the competition], we have continued to study our brise solei, that protects the building from the sun at the corner of Latrobe and Chicago,"" said Joseph Valerio at Wednesday's virtual meeting. ""We wanted our new element to have a stronger geometric relationship to the historic bank building.""  The project's community room has also been repositioned to face the plaza along Chicago Avenue. The adjacent outdoor space features rotating screens that could display art while allowing the plaza to be secured during hours when it is not open to the public. Members of the Committee on Design were by and large receptive to the plan but did provide some feedback and suggestions. Comments included requests to locate more active use along the plaza and possibly shift the bank branch into the new building putting more community amenities in the old structure. The city's Department of Planning and Development will incorporate the comments into their ongoing review of the project.   ",Austin,0.0
"Austin's Laramie Bank to anchor mixed-use complex with housing, blues museum","A neglected former bank building on Chicago’s West Side will be brought back to life and incorporated into a new mixed-use complex, city officials announced last week.   The $37.5 million project will rehabilitate the 1920s-era Laramie Bank at 5200 W. Chicago Avenue and redevelop surrounding vacant lots into a new six-story structure containing 72 units of mixed-income housing. The addition will be set back from the street to create a new community plaza along Chicago Avenue. Designed by Architects Meyer & Cook in the Art Deco style, the original Laramie Bank building is notable for its ornate terra-cotta exterior. Although the structure is a protected Chicago landmark, a decade’s worth of vacancy and neglect has led to its inclusion on Preservation Chicago’s most endangered buildings list. Under the plan, the historic landmark will once again house a bank branch as well as a cafe space, business incubator, and a museum dedicated to blues music. The development is expected to generate up to 150 construction jobs and 22 full-time positions. The project is being led by Austin United Alliance, a design and development joint venture that includes Heartland Alliance, Oak Park Regional Housing Center, Latent Design, and Valerio Dewalt Train Associates. The team's bid to redevelop the Austin site was selected by the city of Chicago as part of its $750 million INVEST South/West program, which aims to revitalize underserved communities on the city’s South and West sides.  Other projects included in the first phase of the initiative are a community-focused ‘eco-food hub’ in Englewood and a 56-unit affordable housing development slated for a vacant lot in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood.  The next phase of INVEST South/West is seeking developer proposals to revitalize sites in Bronzeville, Back of the Yards, North Lawndale, and South Chicago.

DPD kicks off visioning for Belmont Triangle,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has kicked off the visioning for the Belmont Triangle in Avondale. Made up of approximately four acres of land, the triangular block is bound by W. Belmont Ave, N. Milwaukee Ave, and N. Pulaski Rd. More than half of the site is currently vacant due to recent business closures and building demolitions. The vacant parcels are addressed at 3240-84 N. Milwaukee, 3207-47 N. Pulaski, and 3934-62 W. Belmont. In collaboration with Alderman Ariel Reboyras of the 30th Ward, DPD identified the site for community visioning due to its diminished role providing retail- and service-oriented amenities for the neighborhood. The process is part of a strategy to maximize neighborhood opportunity sites throughout Chicago. At the kickoff visioning meeting, DPD announced that the project is leading into a Request For Proposal (RFP), to ultimately solicit development from local developers. The department will engage with the community to draft an RFP vision and ultimately release the RFP in late June this summer. Responses will be due in early Fall with the final selection expected by the end of the year. Currently, the entire block is zoned B3-1, which would allow for a variety of business uses and dwelling units on the upper levels. The properties are currently privately-owned, with no city ownership. The property owners are working in cooperation with DPD to redevelop the site. The meeting included a chance for attendees to begin to contribute input into the future of the site. The visioning process will allow for DPD to develop a concept for the RFP to guide respondents and indicate a potential use for the site. When asked about their vision for the site, common responses included calls for green space, affordable housing, a library, and a community center.  Ending with a Q&A portion, many questions were addressed. The site is within a TIF district and the project could utilize TIF funding or any other city funding available if deemed necessary. With the community’s interest in green space, representatives from DPD said that they envision green space to be part of the plan, but it’s too early to say in what capacity.  DPD will engage with its sister agencies as well to consider a library on the site as well as potential Chicago Park District space. They will also collaborate with CDOT to manage public realm improvements and traffic concerns. An environmental review will also be conducted, but it is not known whether any remediation will be necessary. The new project will likely be a Planned Development and may need a zoning change, requiring a string of approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. A timeline for the approval process once the winning selection has been made will be dependent on the scope of the project.  ",Avondale,0.0

City Council approves industrial development at 328 W. 40th,"The Chicago City Council has approved an industrial development at 328 W. 40th. Developed by The Missner Group, it would replace a vacant property that measures almost an entire block bound by the Penna Railroad to the west, Junction Railway to the north, S. Princeton Ave to the east, and W. Root St to the south. Soudan Metals occupies an L-shaped property that results in this site being an irregular shape.  With Ware Malcomb on board for the design, the industrial project will deliver a one-story Class-A facility that encompasses 180,900 square feet of divisible space. With office space available to suit, the structure will be built of precast concrete painted with a bright color palette. With all truck loading facing the railroad abutment to the west, there will be two drive-in doors and 35 exterior docks for loading. 176 car parking spaces will be included for employees and visitors.  The site plan has been designed to bring trucks to the site up S. Princeton Ave from W. Root St to avoid the homes along W. Root St. Cars can enter the site from both S. Princeton Ave or W. Root St and will be parking along the building or in the parking lot along S. Princeton Ave. Detention ponds have been added along both street frontages to use up leftover pieces of the irregular site and to beautify the site near its surrounding neighborhood.  As part of the requirements for industrial projects, the development team commissioned an air quality impact study. Presenting their findings to the community, the third-party reviewer found that the project’s potential pollutants would not exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) threshold limits.  Positioned as a speculative development, the development team has discussed the strong demand for their product in this area as they lease up one facility nearby and are currently building a second in the neighborhood. Being close to the city center, the developers see potential tenants being food users, light manufacturing, and warehouse/distribution tenants.  With approval of the Planned Development from the Chicago City Council, the $27 million development is now fully approved.

TIF approved for United Yards Phase 1B,"The Community Development Commission has approved $4 million in TIF funding for the first phase of United Yards. Part of the winning Invest South/West RFP project, this phase is located along W. 47th St at 4700 S. Ashland, 4707 S. Marshfield, and 1641 W. 47th. Celadon Partners and Blackwood Development Partners are leading the project.  On the west side of S. Ashland Ave, the New City Supportive Living development, occupying the upper levels of the Goldblatt’s Building, is a previous project by Celadon Partners. As part of Phase 1B, the ground floor will be rehabbed into a 15,000 square-feet federally qualified health center, as well as 7,200 square feet of retail space for local, minority businesses.  Located at 1641 W. 47th, the second portion of this phase will take over a vacant lot at the corner of W. 47th St and S. Marshfield Ave. Designed by local firm DesignBridge, the new construction will be a two-story retail building measuring 6,000 square feet. Originally, the developers proposed residential facing W. 47th St when they went before the Committee on Design. Due to the fact that this would have required a zoning change, the plan was modified to place retail along W. 47th St and reorient the housing to face S. Marshfield Ave.  With the developers working with the community, each building is already set to receive retail tenants. In the Goldblatt’s building, the retail space set aside for minority small businesses will hold Back of The Yards Coffee, a T-shirt shop, a local bakery, and a barber shop. The small retail building just west of that will have a brewery in it that plans to share the building as a community gathering space as well as being the brewery. This phase of the project is set to cost $17.4 million, set to be financed by $1.3 million in deferred developer fees, $2.475 million in lender financing, $4 million in TIF, $4.1 million in Illinois Affordable Housing tax credits, $3.9 million in New Market Tax Credits, and $1.5 million from the Chicago Community Trust. With approval of the $4 million in TIF from the Community Development Commission, the redevelopment agreement and TIF proposal will head to City Council for a final vote of approval. If approved, the TIF will be split into a $2 million payment at issuance of the Certificate of Completion and $2 million at the one-year anniversary of the Certificate of Completion.  Once financing is in line, the developers will pull permits.

Committee on Design reviews United Yards,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the mixed-use United Yards proposal. Located along the W. 47th St corridor, United Yards encompasses a total of four sites engaged in a single redevelopment scheme for the area. The $60 million endeavor is a product of a joint venture between Celadon Partners and the Blackwood Group. The winner of the New City/Back of the Yards Invest South/West RFP, the proposal expanded the scope from the individual original site, reaching the aforementioned $60 million price tag. The development looks to construct a new anchoring building on the main parcel and fuel activation along the 47th St corridor around S. Ashland Ave. With a design from DesignBridge, the new construction will mimic the neutral and earth tones of the original buildings in the scheme.  Starting at the eastern edge of the development strip, the city-owned lot at 1515 W. 47th St is currently a vacant parcel. The original site of the RFP, the project will deliver a 50-unit affordable rental building with ground floor commercial space. The ground floor space within the six-story building will house a business opportunity fund. The developers will be working with the project team from the Back of the Yards RFP submission for the opportunity hub. Next, at the corner of S. Ashland Ave and W. 47th St, the Rainbow Building is an existing largely vacant building. The four-story commercial structure will be adaptively reused into a mixed-use project. It will hold 30 senior rental apartments with ground floor uses including a coffee shop and improved existing retail establishment.  On the west side of S. Ashland Ave, the New City Supportive Living development is a previous project by Celadon Partners. The United Yards project will see a new senior medical clinic and dialysis facility added to the ground floor commercial space. An existing blade sign will be repurposed as a New City gateway and identity signage. The final portion of redevelopment will be located at 1641 W. 47th St. Currently vacant land, the plan proposes to develop two affordable three flats to produce 6 two-bedroom apartments. The modular structures have already been fabricated according to the developer. As part of this phase, the plan looks to vacate S. Marshfield Ave to create an open green space for the new residents.  The project will take in comments from the Committee on Design as the development goes through city review. The plan will need approval for the sale of city-owned land from the Community Development Commission and City Council. Whether any further approvals will be needed is unclear.

Three teams compete for chance to redevelop vacant Back of the Yards lot,"The city is evaluating responses from three teams of developers and community partners seeking to redevelop a vacant lot in the Back of the Yards/New City neighborhood. The project is part of the city's INVEST South/West program to revitalize commercial corridors in historically underserved neighborhoods on the city's South and West sides. City planners issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in November for the roughly 1,500-square-foot, city-owned site at the intersection of 47th and Justine streets. The responses were received in March and officials hope to identify a successful proposal by late summer. The new development should incorporate amenities such as multi-family housing, retail for local businesses, and community spaces that offer ""workforce development training, youth education, and after school programs"" according to the city's website. Thursday evening, officials from the Chicago Department of Planning and Development joined Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th) to co-host a virtual town hall to discuss the three proposals. A recording of the meeting is available on YouTube. ""Development in our communities usually happens to us and not with us, so I'm excited that myself and Ald. Lopez have worked with the Department of Planning to do development differently in our community,"" said Ald. Taylor at Thursday's meeting.""Just know that we are listening and this is a work in progress."" Ald. Raymond Lopez added, ""I am thankful for the three entities that put forth RFPs. The goal was to focus on housing, to focus on retail, and to focus on the community, and I am very excited by what has been proposed."" Here's a brief overview of the three responses: 1515 W. 47th Street LLC Led by Park Row Development, this project would bring 50 affordable studio, one-, and two-bedroom apartments to 47th and Justine. The exterior of the six-story proposal features a welcoming two-story entrance on the corner, rooftop solar panels, a mural, and public open space including a community garden. Inside, there will be an underground parking garage, affordable-rent commercial space for local businesses, and a hydroponics farm for growing micro and leafy greens. The team will partner with Precious Blood Ministry of Reconciliation to provide community programming to put neighbors on the path to homeownership by offering classes on home repair and financial literacy as well as job placement assistance.  The project's estimated cost is $19.8 million. Back of the Yards Works This estimated $15 million proposal forgoes housing in favor of a commercial hub that will provide job opportunities and training for the surrounding community. The development team is lead by Back of the Yards Coffee Co. in partnership with Condor Development. Featuring a grand staircase lined with native plants, the planned building will seek Living Building Challenge certification through sustainable elements like rooftop farms, which will produce grain for beer and baked goods. The building will be occupied by ""homegrown"" businesses and organizations including Back of the Yards Coffee, Sugarberry Bakery, La Selva T-Shirt Shop, the Marimba Institute, and Somo Monos Brewery. United Yards The $51.5 million United Yards proposal comes from New City Redevelopment Limited Partnership, a joint venture between Blackwood Group and affordable housing developer Celadon Partners. The plan is larger in scope than the others and goes beyond the 47th and Justine site, which would be redeveloped into 50 units of affordable housing and a community center. The Rainbow Building at 47th and Ashland would be restored to its former glory and transformed into 22 to 30 affordable senior living units and a new coffee shop for Stockyards Coffee. The developers would also renovate the New City Supportive Living facility in the former Goldblatt's building and construct a pair of new affordable-rate three-flats, a 70-space underground parking garage, and a community park at 47th and Marshfield in collaboration with Star Farm Chicago.   ",Back of the Yards,0.0
New elementary school in Belmont Cragin lands $34M permit,"A plan from the Public Building Commission of Chicago to build a new elementary school at the southeastern corner of Riis Park is moving forward in the Belmont Cragin community on the city's Northwest Side. On Tuesday, the project was awarded an estimated $34.4 million construction permit—a clear signal that work could soon begin along the 6100 block of West Fullerton Avenue.  The Chicago Park District Board voted in January to lease roughly 3.25 acres of parkland to the Chicago Public Schools for 40 years with an option to renew. Under the agreement, CPS will pay for the school, and the Park District will get $10 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) money to improve the park's existing 1920s-era field house, reported WTTW Chicago. Zoning for the Belmont Cragin project was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in February. Designed by SMNGA and FORMA Architecture, the new school will connect to the Riis Park field house and replace the old building's gymnasium wing. The upcoming complex includes a three-story classroom structure plus a multi-purpose building containing a gym, cafeteria, and auditorium space. The plan also calls for a new parking lot with spaces for 43 vehicles and improvements to the nearby playground.  Construction on the new school is scheduled to begin this fall, and the recent building permit is a good indicator that the project appears to be on track. If everything moves forward smoothly, the facility could be ready to open in time for the fall 2022 school year. George Sollitt Construction Company will serve as the general contractor, according to information listed on the permit.

While the school originally envisioned rehabbing the existing structures, they were found to be in very poor condition and not up to code for use as a school. The Pui Tak Christian School was founded in 1953 to equip young students academically and spiritually and teaches students from preschool all the way through 8th grade. The school is looking to build the new facilities due to a collection of challenges including the fact that their current facility is at capacity, they have limited classroom space, and are using mobile and temporary classrooms. They also have insufficient bathrooms and are split between two different buildings.  With SOM and Wight and Company collaborating on the design, the new building would stand four stories high and offer space for approximately 400 students and 45 staff members. Rising 55 feet, the school is massed sensitively to the area, setting back 57 feet from the street, as well as 37 feet from the south to create a buffer between the school and nearby residential homes. This space along the south side of the property will be occupied by a playground for the students.  The entry to the school will be pronounced with an inset along the bar-shaped plan, with a portal-like space that exhibits openness and transparency. The gymnasium will float above the staff parking to the north of the entry as a glowing, frosted glass box, while classrooms will span the length of the building south of the entry.   The ground floor of the school will be host to the reception and staff office as well as five Pre-K rooms. On the second floor, the aforementioned gymnasium will double as the auditorium and will be accessible to the public for events through a stair and elevator. The remainder of the second floor will hold the library and junior kindergarten rooms. On the third floor, students will have access to the cafeteria and art room, as well as kindergarten and first grade classrooms. Classrooms for 2nd through 8th graders will be located on the fourth floor, as well as the language room, music room, and science room.  The building will have a sustainable design by utilizing a green roof, installing solar panels, retaining rainwater, using an energy-efficient HVAC system, using vertical fins for self-shading, providing permeable pavers and extended landscaping on the site, alongside a host of other efforts.  The school has been working on this plan for a number of years and even acquired the property back in April 2019. Since then, COVID has hampered progress, but the school is looking towards 2024 or 2025 as a target for construction, with a capital campaign leading up to the start of construction. The project will need approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals to allow a school on the site as a special use.  ",Bridgeport,0.0
Summer Construction Week: Ramova Theater,"Summer is the quintessential time of year for construction, especially with our cold winters here in Chicago. As we near the end of the summer, Urbanize has toured a series of construction projects in the city to check in on progress on the latest developments. Today, we begin with an inside look at the renovation of a neighborhood gem: the Ramova Theater. Originally built in 1929 as a movie theater, the Ramova Theater, located at 3520 S. Halsted, has stood vacant in the Bridgeport neighborhood since 1985. Tyler Nevius of Our Revival Chicago has teamed up with Baum Revision to reinvigorate the building and bring it back to life. After years of planning, work is currently underway on-site. Stretching down S. Halsted St, the project combines the Ramova Theater building with two commercial buildings that face the street, screening the theater space. Exterior work on the brick and terracotta is wrapping up, with some terracotta pieces having been molded and remade to replace broken pieces. The marquee sign will be removed and shipped off for restoration once the scaffolding comes down later this week. We began the tour inside the building right behind the boarded-up entry to the lobby. After decades of neglect, the interior has significant water damage and, at this point in time, has undergone selective demolition by McHugh Construction as part of the project. As part of the restoration, the lobby will be brought back to its original Spanish Courtyard style, with lots of plaster work ahead. Heading into the main theater, the space is impressively large upon first entry. Large openings have been dug into the floor as part of mechanical work and the space is currently an open shell. The space will be reconfigured with a new stage protruding into the original seating area, and a new second-floor balcony will be added to expand capacity. Before full restoration work can be done on the plaster ceiling and walls, the ceiling will be opened up to reinforce the structure for large lighting rigs. The new live music venue will have a capacity of approximately 1,700 people once completed. Fronting the street just north of the theater entry, the next stop on the tour was the taproom. As part of the entire project designed by O’Riley Office, the taproom will see the construction of a new bar and dining space overlooking brewery operations on the basement level. Partnered with a local brewer, the space will be built out similarly to the brewer’s original Chicago location. For brewery patrons, a small strip of land just south of the theater entry will be turned into an outdoor beer garden. Above the taproom, a second-floor space is under restoration with reinforced bowstring trusses. With a capacity for approximately 200 people, the space is being envisioned for potential small acoustic or private performances as well as being opened to local community businesses for art festivals and other events.  At the north end of the project, the final building will be converted into a small diner. Measuring 800 square feet, the 30-seat diner will open up in the 1880s building, reviving the former Ramova Grill that closed in 2012. Kevin Hickey, award-winning chef and owner of The Duck Inn, will run the restaurant once it is opened. At the back of the building, a ramp will go down into the basement for brewery operations. As part of the development, all of the spaces will be connected to allow for access between them. While giving each space its own identity and separate entries from the street, stairs and elevators will be added to facilitate access within the building. A small interior courtyard will be enclosed and turned into space for restrooms.   With McHugh Construction leading the construction, completion is set for late spring 2023. ",Bridgeport,0.0
Permits issued for mixed-use building at 2805 S. Halsted,"A $6 million permit has been issued for the construction of a four-story mixed-use residential building located in Bridgeport. Developed by Jackie Chan of J & I Development, the new construction will rise on the long-vacant parcel. Situated directly across from Palmisano Park, the corner property at 2805 S. Halsted St will front both S. Halsted Street and W. 28th St.  The four-story, neighborhood-focused, mixed-use development will hold retail space, parking, and 28 dwelling units. The small retail space will hold a coffee shop facing onto S. Halsted St while the rest of the ground floor offers indoor parking for 28 cars accessed from the alley. With a design from Hirsch MPG, the structure will be built of wood construction and masonry bearing walls perched on a precast concrete plank podium. The project has been designed to be as economical as possible to keep the units affordable. The unit mix will offer larger units to bring families to the area while also offering smaller units for single individuals.  With the reported $6 million permit in hand, MPI Contracting Inc., the designated general contractor for the project, can commence construction. A timeline for completion is currently unknown. ",Bridgeport,1.0
Renovation of Bridgeport's Ramova Theater begins,"The long-awaited rebirth of Bridgeport's Ramova Theater took a big step forward this week as co-developers Our Revival Chicago LLC and Baum Revision broke ground on an estimated $28 million renovation. The project will breathe new life into the historic structure at 3518 S. Halsted Street, which was designed by Meyer O. Nathan in 1929 in the Spanish courtyard style as a companion venue to Lakeview's Music Box Theatre. The Ramova has sat vacant since closing in 1985. When it reopens in late 2022, the reimagined venue will be home to a 1,600-seat auditorium and a balcony-level theater accommodating up to 200 people. The plan also includes an adjacent 4,000-square-foot brewery and tap room, an 800-square-foot Ramova Grill restaurant at 3510 S. Halsted Street, and a 50-space parking lot across the street. The developers selected McHugh Construction as general contractor and O'Riley Office to serve as architect on the $28 million adaptive reuse project. Developer Tyler Nevius of Our Revival purchased the dilapidated Ramova property from the city for $1 and was awarded $6.8 million in tax increment financing (TIF). The project was first approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in January 2020 but had to go before the commissioners again in July of this year due to ""delays brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.""    ",Bridgeport,0.0
Park District cuts ribbon on new headquarters,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Chicago Park District CEO Rosa Escareño, and local community leaders cut the ribbon on the new Chicago Park District headquarters and multi-purpose fieldhouse and green space for families in the Brighton Park neighborhood. The new Park District headquarters and fieldhouse at 4830 S. Western brings 17 acres of open space to one of Chicago’s most park-deprived communities and further the City’s commitment to bring significant investment to areas in need.   “The new Chicago Park District headquarters and community park is a prime example of how meaningful investments can transform a neighborhood and bring valuable resources and opportunities to residents,” said Mayor Lightfoot. ""For far too long, Brighton Park families have had to travel to neighboring communities to access essential park resources. This project marks a new day for Brighton Park and our city as the headquarters will serve the vitality and well-being of Southwest Side communities.”  The Chicago Park District will relocate its administrative headquarters to the building from its current Streeterville location in early June. This 58,100 square foot, multi-story facility with 17 acres of multi-use park space will include a new 20,000 square foot public fieldhouse that will bring new recreation, as well as cultural and educational opportunities, to the neighborhood. Formerly a contaminated industrial property, the 17-acre campus park will include two artificial turf athletic fields with lighting, a grand lawn, walkways, a playground, spray pool, natural area, nature play space, and bike and vehicle parking. The fieldhouse features a gymnasium, fitness center, bathrooms, locker rooms, and community multi-purpose rooms.  Designed by John Ronan Architects, the building design is rooted in the history of the Southwest Side and stands as an example of the future of sustainable development in an area known for manufacturing and industry. The walls of the courtyard and interior spaces are made of reclaimed Chicago common brick, and all of the building materials were selected for their constructability, durability, and ease of maintenance.  Additionally, aluminum sunscreen shields the building from direct sunlight to increase the overall energy efficiency of the building. The building includes window glazing that is bird-friendly and patterned with a ceramic frit to warn off incoming birds. In addition, the project has EV charging stations - with space to expand for more, 102 bike parking spaces, and a 15,000 square foot green roof. ",Brighton Park,0.0
New Park District HQ in Brighton Park ready to begin construction,"A plan to build new headquarters for the Chicago Park District in the southwest side neighborhood of Brighton Park is ready to move forward after scoring its first construction permit. Slated for a 17-acre site near the intersection of 48th Street and Western Avenue, the new two-story facility features a circular design from Chicago-based John Ronan Architects clad in a scalloped metal screen.  The 78,000-square-foot building will not only contain offices for the Park District but also serve as a fieldhouse for three new athletic fields and a community playground and spray pool. First announced in 2018 by then-mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Brighton Park project was seen as a way for the Park District to own rather than rent its offices and to make an investment in one of Chicago's neighborhoods. The city agency will move out of offices in Streeterville, which belong to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. ""The development of the Brighton Park site for the Chicago Park District headquarters is a win-win situation for the district and the community,"" said Superintendent Michael Kelly in a 2018 statement. ""In addition to the efficiencies of owning our headquarters, we are bringing much-needed parkland and amenities to the children and families of this community.” In December, the city's Transportation Committee voted to vacate 19,000 square feet of South Campbell Avenue near 48th Street, reported the Chicago Sun-Times. The move was seen as one of the final hurdles facing the long-discussed project. The new HQ will relocate 200 existing Park District jobs to Brighton Park and is expected to create approximately 350 construction jobs in the process. The permit estimates the scope of the work at $55 million and lists F.H. Paschen, S.N. Nielsen & Associates as the project's general contractor.    ",Brighton Park,0.0

Lightfoot cuts ribbon on 43rd St pedestrian bridge,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot joined Alderman Sophia King, the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), and members of the Bronzeville community to celebrate the opening of the 43rd Street Pedestrian Bridge. The new, fully accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge over South DuSable Lake Shore Drive and the Metra Electric and Canadian National Railway tracks provides a vital link for South Side residents to access Chicago’s lakefront.     ""This ribbon cutting is an extraordinary example of all levels of government working together to invest in and build our city's infrastructure in historically disinvested communities,"" said Mayor Lightfoot. ""Thank you to our federal and state partners for funding this fully accessible bridge that will improve connections between the Bronzeville and Kenwood neighborhoods and the lakefront."" The new bridge is fully ADA accessible, with ramps to accommodate people using bicycles, wheelchairs, and emergency vehicles. It replaces the previously deteriorated and non-ADA compliant pedestrian bridge at 43rd Street. The $36M project was funded through a combination of federal and state funding.  “CDOT is excited to celebrate the completion of this project that will greatly improve access to and from Chicago’s lakefront for Bronzeville residents of all ages and levels of mobility,” said CDOT Commissioner Gia Biagi. “Thanks to our federal and state partners for supporting this project and for investing in infrastructure improvements that improve quality of life for Chicagoans.”   The 43rd Street Pedestrian Bridge is the fourth of five new or rebuilt bridge projects undertaken by CDOT that are making the City’s lakefront more easily accessible to residents of Greater Bronzeville and Kenwood neighborhoods. It features a similar design to the 41st Street Bridge, which was completed in 2018. Both spans were designed by AECOM with Cordogan, Clark & Associates and feature inclined arch mono-truss structures supporting large, graceful S-curves that echo the curves of the walkways in Burnham Park. The prime contractor was FH Paschen. ",Bronzeville,0.0
43 Green cuts ribbon and breaks ground,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined The Habitat Company, P3 Markets, and city officials to cut the ribbon on 43 Green Phase 1 and break ground on 43 Green Phase 2. Flanking the 43rd CTA Green Line station, the two-phase development is totaling $81.8 million in investment in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood on formerly city-owned land. “I am pleased to see an equitable transit-oriented development come to Bronzeville that will enhance the vibrancy and affordability of the community,” said Mayor Lightfoot. ""43 Green demonstrates what can arise when a city prioritizes investing in its neighborhoods. This development will ensure that Bronzeville residents can access all the employment, educational, and recreational opportunities throughout our city via convenient transit access while promoting a dense, mixed-use, and walkable corridor.”   With the ribbon cutting celebrating the opening of 43 Green Phase 1, the $37.8 million development has built a 10-story building that includes 99 units, 5,500 square feet of retail space and 24 off-street parking spaces. With a design from Landon Bone Baker Architects, apartments will range from studio to one- and two-bedrooms with half of the residences listed as market-rate and the other half offered as affordable units at 60% AMI. Two future retail tenants earmarked for 43 Green include Momentum Coffee and Super Cycle. The city’s investment in Phase 1 includes $5 million in TIF funds, $3 million in Multi-Family Loan funds, and $1.95 million in 9% LIHTC allocation.  With the groundbreaking marking the beginning of construction for Phase II, the $44 million investment will build another 10-story building holding 80 residential units and 4,000 square feet of ground floor retail space. Future tenants include a UPS office and dental practice. 13 car parking spaces and 56 bike parking spaces will be provided. With Landon Bone Baker Architects and Moody Nolan collaborating on the design, the 106-foot-tall building will include 37 units priced at 60% AMI, 7 at 50% AMI, and 36 at market-rate. The unit breakdown will include 24 studios averaging 470 square feet, 48 one-beds averaging 660 square feet, and 8 two-bed apartments that will average 925 square feet. The city’s investment in Phase 2 includes $10 million in TIF Funds, up to $6.5 million in Multi-Family Loan funds, and $2.25 million in 9% LIHTC allocation. In addition to bringing more affordable units to Bronzeville, the buildings were designed with environmental consideration. Some of the sustainable features include the Energy Star Certification and reduction of building energy use by 15% from the baseline, as well as a high-performance glazing and building envelope, on-site stormwater management, and an extensive green roof system. There’s also efficient LED indoor lighting and dark-sky friendly exterior lighting.   Construction of 43 Green is being led by a joint venture of Bowa Construction and McHugh Construction.  ",Bronzeville,0.0
43 Green Phase 2 scores permits,"The second phase of 43 Green, a mixed-use eTOD adjacent to the 43rd CTA Green Line stop, has received both its caisson and full building permit. Located at 4307 S. Prairie, the project will rise to the west of the 43rd Green Line CTA stop.  The Habitat Company and P3 Markets are co-developing the new mixed-use project, which is set to deliver a 10-story building holding 80 residential units and 4,000 square feet of ground floor retail space. Future tenants include a UPS office and dental practice. 13 car parking spaces and 56 bike parking spaces will be provided. With Landon Bone Baker Architects and Moody Nolan collaborating on the design, the building’s massing will define the urban edge at the corner of the property, while using setbacks to reduce the massing of the building adjacent to the neighborhood to the south and CTA L tracks to the east. The massing aims to reference the volume of the first phase, creating two bookends flanking the CTA tracks.  Rising 106 feet, the roofline will match phase one, with the building massing broken up into different sections that exhibit a modulation in facade treatment, creating interest and differentiation along both street frontages. Balconies are used as a massing strategy to erode corners and provide residents with views of the surrounding city. With 80 units in the building, 37 units will be priced at 60% AMI, 7 at 50% AMI, and 36 at market-rate. The unit breakdown will include 24 studios averaging 470 square feet, 48 one-beds averaging 660 square feet, and 8 two-bed apartments that will average 925 square feet. The $45 million project will be funded through a variety of sources, including $10 million in TIF funding, $6.3 million from a HUD mortgage, $20.9 million in LIHTC equity, $6.5 million in multifamily housing funds, and $610,000 in deferred developer fees. The two city-owned lots, appraised at $162,000, will be sold to the developer at $1 per parcel.  With the issuance of both permits, general contractors Bowa Construction and McHugh Construction can begin building the development. Construction was originally planned to begin in January 2023, so the planned completion date of Q2 2024 is likely to be pushed back. ",Bronzeville,1.0
Mixed-use development planned at 535 E. 47th,"A mixed-use development has been proposed for a block-long site at 535 E. 47th. Located along the street between S. St Lawrence Ave and S. Forrestville Ave, the project will replace a currently vacant stretch of land along the corridor. Bronzeville Corridor LLC is the developer behind the proposal.  Designed by SGW Architecture and Design, the proposal will see the construction of five separate buildings that all stand four stories tall. Rising approximately 45 feet, the buildings have been designed with a universal treatment of brick masonry and stone accents to make the set of structures look as one large building. The mixed-use buildings have been designed with commercial space on the ground floor and condominium units on the upper floors. The two structures at the ends of the block will occupy the entire site and provide 2,500 square feet of commercial space. The middle three buildings will setback from the property line and hold split retail spaces measuring 1,300 and 1,200 square feet. With each building outfitted with elevators, the upper floors will have two units per floor, totaling 30 three-bedroom condos. Each building will have 6 parking spaces on the ground floor, including one accessible parking spot per building. With the project set to be built within the existing zoning, the developer is planning to build the project in phases over time. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Bronzeville,0.0

Triangle Square condos debut along North Branch Corridor,"Chicago-based developer Belgravia Group, Ltd. has unveiled two model untis at Triangle Square, its new condominium complex at 1701 W. Webster Avenue in Bucktown. The project, billed as the first new-construction condominium building since the rezoning of the adjacent North Branch Corridor, features 72 for-sale units in two- and three-bedroom floor plans. “Belgravia has a long history of introducing buyers to new neighborhoods, and we’re now at the most exciting part of that process at Triangle Square with our first residents moving in and bringing even more energy to an area that has so much potential for growth,” said Belgravia Group co-chief executive David Goldman. “Already you can see the transformation Triangle Square has sparked in East Bucktown, which speaks volumes about the confidence buyers have for the future of this neighborhood.” Sales prices for Triangle Square start at $612,000 for a two-bedroom unit, $742,000 for a three-bedroom unit, and $927,000 for homes with three bedrooms with an in-home office.  Residents will have access to on-site amenities including a rooftop deck, a fitness center, and a dog-washing station. Designed by Sullivan Goulette & Wilson, the look of Triangle Square is intended to reference Bucktown's industrial past, and is part of a larger multi-phase development which also includes a 300-unit apartment building by LMC. A third building featuring retail is yet to be built. For more information, visit trianglesquarechicago.com. ",Bucktown,0.0
New apartments and condos take shape along North Branch Corridor,"In ""east Bucktown,"" work continues on the new mid-rise residential development known as Triangle Square. The estimated $200 million project has been under construction at 2155 N. Elston Avenue since early 2020, and is now starting to resemble renderings of the finished product. Triangle Square gets its somewhat contradictory geometric name (how can a triangle be a square?) from the odd shape of its three-sided 4-acre lot. Previously home to a billboard facing the Kennedy Expressway, the once vacant site is bounded by Elston Avenue, Webster Avenue, and Metra’s UP-North rail tracks. The main piece of the project is a seven-story apartment building from LMC, a subsidiary of Miami-based developer Lennar Corp., and Chicago architecture firm Lamar Johnson Collaborative. With the help of Power Construction, the Lennar-Lamar team will build 398 studio, one-, and two-bedroom rental units above 35,000 square feet of retail space fronting Elston. The rental building snakes it way around site and has a distinctive sloping roofline. Amenities include a fitness center, club room, game room, and co-working spaces. The project's literal centerpiece will be a 23,000 square foot outdoor terrace facing the Chicago skyline. The supersized communal courtyard features a pool, grills, fire pits, and a bocce court.  The second piece of the Triangle Square equation is a separate seven-story condominium building along Webster Avenue. Developed by Belgravia Group and designed by Sullivan Goulette & Wilson, the more traditional-looking masonry structure includes 72 for-sale units offered in two- and three-bedroom floorplans, priced from $495,000 to $1 million. There's no word yet on the rent prices for the apartments, which are expected to welcome residents this fall. The condominiums, which broke ground earlier, are on track to deliver this summer.  Triangle Square was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in September 2018. The plan requires nine affordable units on-site plus a $3.6 million contribution from the developer to Chicago's affordable housing fund, according to the Chicago Department of Planning and Development. The project was made possible by a sweeping rezone of the North Branch Corridor in 2017, which opened 760 acres of industrial land along the Chicago River's north branch to new uses including residential. Other projects are expected to soon follow including the massive Lincoln Yards megadevelopment that's zoned for up to 6,000 residences.    ",Bucktown,0.0
Plans for riverfront driving range in Bucktown scrapped,"A three-story driving range and entertainment complex is no longer in the works for the North Branch of the Chicago River in Bucktown. Operator Drive Shack has scrapped plans for its $40 million redevelopment of the 9.3-acre Vienna Beef factory at the Damen-Elston-Fullerton intersection, across from the Midtown Athletic Club.  Similar in concept to Topgolf, Drive Shack’s Chicago location would have included more than 100 climate-controlled driving range bays oriented toward the Chicago skyline plus both indoor and outdoor dining facilities.  The project was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in January 2020. And while its 337-car parking lot wasn’t exactly the pinnacle of urban design, the plan did include some unique site-specific features such as a landscaped public riverwalk along the waterfront.  Chicago Golf Report broke the news on Drive Shack’s decision to abandon its Bucktown plans. The publication did not say why the company pulled the plug on the project. Paul Sajovec, a staffer for Ald. Scott Waguespack, told Block Club Chicago that any future redevelopment of 2501 N. Damen Avenue would have to essentially restart the zoning process “unless someone else wants to develop the property under the same basic plan.” ",Bucktown,0.0

PRC approves Immaculata revamp at 640 W. Irving Park,"The Permit Review Committee has approved plans to convert the Immaculata High School into apartments at 640 W. Irving Park. Conceived as part of a larger plan by KGiles LLC and CA Ventures, the development will see the conversion of the school into apartments as well as the addition of a 22-story senior living tower on the parking lot behind the school. Located in Buena Park, the project is located along N Marine Drive, between W Irving Park Road and W Bittersweet Place. The landmarked property consists of the original 1922 Prairie Style school building that sits at the southeast corner of the property. A 1955 convent addition was built to the north in 1955 and a school addition was added to the west in 1956. The landmark designation encompasses all parts of the school including the additions but doesn’t specify what should be protected. Staff visited the school and have deemed all exterior elevations as well as the central lobby cast iron stair and two-story auditorium on the interior as significant features to be protected from demolition or alteration. With Level Architecture in charge of the conversion, the school will be converted to hold 245 typical apartments, made up of mostly studios and one-beds with five two-bedroom configurations. 20% of the overall unit count, or 49 units, will be designated as affordable. Through the conversion, the main lobby stair will remain, but must be enclosed inside a vestibule to meet current fire codes. A rooftop deck will be added onto the 1956 school addition with a large setback from the street to reduce its visibility. A new elevator and stair penthouse will poke up above the roof to serve the new roof deck.  New windows will be installed to match the original which were replaced without approval. The condition of the remaining historic windows will be investigated, and repairs will be made as needed. Facing the interior courtyard, some windows will be converted into operable windows to meet code requirements and some new basement windows will be added.  With an estimated cost of $65 million for the adaptive reuse, the combined development with the new tower is what makes the conversion financially feasible.  With a design from Perkins Eastman the 22-story senior living tower will contain 108 independent living units, 32 memory care units, 60 assisted living units and 98 parking spaces behind the historic building. 20% of the unit count, or 20 units, will be designated as affordable. With approval from the Permit Review Committee, the project can move forward with other approvals. The project recently received approval from 46th Ward Alderman Cappelman and it will go before the Chicago Plan Commission later this month before garnering final approval from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.

CDC approves land acquisition for Columbus Ave reconstruction,"The Community Development Commission has approved the proposed land acquisition for the reconstruction of S. Columbus Ave in Chicago Lawn. Planned for the stretch between S. Kedzie Ave and S. Western Ave, CDOT is leading the project to expand S. Columbus Ave and separate it from the train tracks that currently cross the street. With the Belt Railway currently crossing at grade, cars and pedestrians must stop which creates an inconvenience and the crossing becomes a safety issue. The project is looking to reduce congestion, traffic flow, and enhance safety as 45 crashes have been reported at the crossing since 1956. The crossing is also a critical route for emergency vehicles. To improve the crossing, the railroad will be kept at the same elevation and S. Columbus Ave will be lowered under the railroad with a new bridge built for the train tracks. To support the project, a small pump station will be built to convey stormwater from the roadway underpass. As part of the project, S. Columbus Ave will be rebuilt and widened with new bike lanes and widened sidewalks. Dedicated bike lanes will be incorporated with painted lanes on the roadway with one-way lanes going each direction.  To make room for the widened roadway, CDOT will acquire a set of properties along the corridor. At S. Maplewood Ave and S. Campbell Ave, the streets will be terminated and turned into cul-de-sacs because they will now be higher than the newly lowered roadway. The $86 million project will be funded via a variety of sources, including $45 million from the National Highway Freight Program, $1 million from the REbuild Illinois Program, $17 million from the State Only Chicago Commitment, and the final $22.5 million has yet to be secured. Despite the $22.5 million shortcoming, the project will use absolutely no city funding. The final apportionment will come from either state or federal financing sources.  Phase 1 engineering has been completed and Phase 2 engineering is expected to be completed by Q3 2022. Construction is expected to begin in Q1 2023 with a completion date of Q4 2024.  ",Chicago Lawn,0.0
Class L incentive approved for redevelopment of Hoyt Building,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a Class L tax incentive for the redevelopment of the Hoyt Building at 465 W. Cermak. Located within the Cermak Road Bridge District, the building sits along the south branch of the Chicago River on the south side of W. Cermak Rd. Developer Windfall Group is behind the mixed-use adaptive reuse. Originally designed by architects Nimmons and Fellows and completed in 1909, the facade was designed with brick piers ornamented with limestone and terracotta details. The entrance to the Hoyt Company’s offices on the second floor is centered on the Cermak Road elevation with an ornamental terracotta surround. On the interior, concrete columns support large, open floor plates. With SPACE Architects + Planners on board for the adaptive reuse, the redeveloped building will hold a 4-star extended stay hotel, a grocery store, retail, dining, entertainment, a spa, and a medical center. The larger development will include new retail and a parking garage on adjacent lots. The $40.8 million project will fully rehabilitate the building envelope, replacing damaged masonry where needed and repointing masonry joints to match the existing mortar. Some of the windows were previously replaced in 2018, so planned work will repair and replace existing windows as needed while restoring window openings that were infilled with concrete block or plywood. At the base of the building, a new arcade will be carved into the east elevation by inserting a new glazed storefront system 8 feet behind the masonry piers to create an entryway into the building. To the north of the new entry arcade is a sunken plaza that will create a publicly accessible walkway through the building to a new portion of riverwalk. The new riverwalk will be complimented by a second new arcade that sets into the lower level almost 14 feet.  On the roof, the rehab will replace the glazing in the skylights and add rooftop solar panels. New HVAC units will provide the building with modern ventilation and cooling. Three new elevator shafts will be carved into the building and overruns will rise out of the roof accordingly. On the top floor of the building, portions of the roof will be removed to create courtyards which will be framed with new glazed storefronts and metal cladding. The development will have a minimum investment of just under $5 million, with the expenditure of $32.3 million in qualifying rehabilitation expenses. This expenditure exceeds the 50% minimum investment required to qualify for the Class L tax incentive. As outlined, the development will have a total tax abatement of approximately $15 million over the 12-year period of the tax incentive. With approval from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks confirmed, the development is one step closer to starting construction. The developers are planning to start construction as soon as October of this year and complete the project in Spring 2026 after 30 months of construction. ",Chinatown,1.0

If all goes well, construction could begin in Summer 2024 and last 18 months. Completion is expected by the end of 2025. ",Chinatown,0.0
Photos: A look inside Chinatown's new SpringHill Suites hotel,"Work is complete on Chinatown's new 148-room SpringHill Suites hotel, which was built as a four-story vertical expansion of an existing parking garage and retail strip. Located at 2353 S. Wentworth Avenue and steps from the Cermack-Chinatown CTA Red Line station, the 80,000-square-foot development operates under parent company Marriott International and is currently accepting reservations on its website. The SpringHill Suites project comes from developer ME Wentworth, LLC. The venture is led by investor Che Mei Wong, who paid $10.6 million for the property in 2017, according to Crain's Chicago Business. The new hotel was completed with minimal interruption to the existing structure's retail and office tenants by using deep micropile foundations to support the weight of the addition, said Summit Design + Build, which served as construction manager on the project. Chicago-based Vari Architects designed the new structure with some zen-inspired touches as a nod to the surrounding neighborhood. Amenities include a first-floor lobby and reception area, a gym, breakfast room, and meeting room. The newly-completed SpringHill Suites hotel isn't the only notable project along Wentworth Avenue. Several blocks to the north, the Chicago Department of Transportation continues to oversee work on the Wells-Wentworth Connector—a new north-south roadway that will connect Chinatown to the Loop.       ",Chinatown,0.0
Urbanize Wrapped: Chicago’s Most Anticipated Projects in 2024,"After reflecting on 2023 with Urbanize Chicago’s Top Ten Articles of 2023, it’s time to look forward to some of the most anticipated developments in 2024. Here are some of the biggest projects we're looking forward to seeing progress on in 2024: Bally’s Casino With Bally’s temporary facility up and running at Medinah Temple, Bally’s Corporation can turn their attention towards the site of their permanent facility planned at 777 W. Chicago. With approval secured from the Illinois Gaming Board for their permanent license, Bally’s is working towards beginning construction in 2024 after they take control of the site this summer. With Gensler leading the redesign, foundation permits for the casino have already been filed. -- Lincoln Yards Chicago developer Sterling Bay missed their goal of breaking ground on the next phase of Lincoln Yards in 2023. While site plan approval was secured and permits are pending for the next two buildings, Sterling Bay has struggled to piece together financing for Lincoln Yards, putting the future of the megadevelopment in question. In 2024 we’ll be watching to see if Sterling Bay can secure a new financing structure to fund the required infrastructure work and development overall to allow for more buildings to start on the property. -- Halsted Pointe While this development also missed their goal of breaking ground in 2023, developer Onni Group received approval for the redesign to the first phase in June 2023 and have permits in the works to break ground sometime in 2024. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the first phase will be a 46-story, 497-foot-tall tower with 460 apartments, 200 parking spaces, and 18,900 square feet of retail. -- 1000M After construction was halted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, developers of 1000M switched the tower from 421 condos to 738 rentals and secured new financing at the end of 2021. With construction back in full swing through 2022 and 2023, the tower is set to welcome residents this summer 2024. -- Thompson Center After the saga of trying to sell the Thompson Center, the purchase by The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group means the building will be saved from the wrecking ball. With Google on board to occupy the building after its redevelopment, work is expected to begin in 2024 on the initial demolition of the facade and interiors, with the late Helmut Jahn’s firm Jahn/ leading the redesign. -- 400 Lake Shore Drive Over 15 years after the demise of the Chicago Spire proposal, construction is finally underway on a new skyscraper development at 400 Lake Shore Drive. Led by Related Midwest, the SOM-designed skyscraper will reach 875 feet tall with 635 rental units inside. Crews will begin below-grade work, including caissons, sheeting, and the cofferdam in 2024 for the northern tower, with construction set to finish in Q3 2027. The southern tower will begin sometime following the first, set to be either condos or rentals based on market conditions. -- LaSalle Street Reimagined After the Lightfoot Administration launched and judged proposals for the redevelopment of office properties on LaSalle Street, newly elected Mayor Brandon Johnson has been quiet on the future of city funding lined up for these proposals via the city’s TIF coffers downtown. In 2024, we’re looking to see if the new budget that pulls money out of TIF districts means the end of city funding for these series of proposals or if Mayor Johnson will work with DPD and DOH to push them forward.  -- Redefine the Drive IDOT and CDOT showed off renderings of the potential future conditions of an expanded North Jean-Baptiste Pointe DuSable Lake Shore Drive between Grand Ave and Hollywood Ave in 2023. 2024 will see the announcement of the decision of their preferred design plan for the redevelopment.

Urbanize Wrapped: Chicago’s Top Ten Articles of 2023,"Reflecting on 2023, Urbanize Chicago wrote over 600 articles about commercial real estate, architecture, construction, and urbanism in our city. Despite a tumultuous economy, many developments rose and wrapped up construction this year and numerous projects were approved throughout the year. While new starts were fewer than previous years, we recently got to share a rare groundbreaking in 2023 at 919 W. Fulton after the developers secured financing. Before we begin 2024, we thought we’d share the stories that you all read the most. Here is Urbanize Wrapped: Chicago’s Top Ten Articles of 2023: 10. Tribune East Tower may still happen Almost three years after the tower was originally approved, Urbanize reported that developer CIM Group has publicized a bidding opportunity for the development on their website. Shortly after our reporting and other outlets shared the news, the bidding opportunity disappeared from the site with no official comments from the developer. Designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the supertall skyscraper will stand 1,442 feet, just 8 feet shy of Willis Tower’s 1,450 feet. Rising 102 floors, the structure will taper as it rises, clad in a glass curtain wall with gold-colored vertical fins that preserves views of the original Tribune Tower from the Ogden Slip. The 1.3 million square-foot building will have 250 hotel keys, 125 condominiums, 439 rentals, and 426 parking spaces. -- 9. Details emerge for mixed-use development at 700 W. Chicago With the original zoning application filed at the end of July, this article shared more details of the mixed-use development’s scope per building and of its riverfront design. Dubbed Halsted Landing, the development is being proposed by Onni Group with Goettsch Partners serving as the architect. Set to total 2,451 residential units, the project will support the housing with ground-floor retail space, 1,950 parking spaces located underground, 2,451 bike parking spaces and extensive exterior landscaping along the Chicago River.  -- 8. One Chicago Voted Chicago’s Best Skyscraper After thousands of votes across the tournament, readers voted One Chicago as Urbanize Chicago’s 2023 Best Skyscraper! Beating the John Hancock Center in the Championship Round, the heated vote generated lots of interest and views by all of you! Stay tuned for 2024’s upcoming March Madness themed tournament! -- 7. 450-foot-tall slender tower proposed at 1565 N. Clybourn Just announced at the beginning of December, this new proposal comes from New York-based developer The Georgetown Company. Designed by bKL Architecture, the 37-story, 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 apartments and 2,500 square feet of retail. The slender tower will have no new parking of its own, but the developer will use a parking garage they own behind the future tower. -- 6. Next phase of Lincoln Yards will break ground this year While this story was very popular amongst our readers, developer Sterling Bay ended up missing their goal of breaking ground on the next phase of Lincoln Yards in 2023. While site plan approval was secured and permits are pending for the next two buildings, Sterling Bay has struggled to piece together financing for Lincoln Yards, putting the future of the megadevelopment in question.  -- 5. Google releases renderings of Thompson Center redevelopment Recently announced this month, Google shared new renderings of their planned redevelopment of the Thompson Center downtown. The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group are leading the redevelopment with Jahn/ serving as the architect. With the first permits already issued for the construction, work is expected to begin early in 2024. -- 4. 400 Lake Shore Drive shows signs of life This summer we broke news that 400 Lake Shore Drive was actively working its ways towards starting construction. The pending foundation permit showed that the northern tower planned by Related Midwest and designed by Skidmore Owings Merrill would be first to rise. The 72-story skyscraper will reach 875 feet tall with 635 rental units inside.  -- 3. Halsted Pointe set to break ground this year While developer Onni Group missed their goal of breaking ground in 2023, our reporting in April came before we learned of the redesign to the first phase that was approved in June 2023. While permits are in the works for the redesigned tower by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the new groundbreaking is planned for some time in 2024. Overall, Onni Group is planning four phases of development that are expected to deliver up to 2,650 residential units, retail space, a hotel, and 1,470 parking spaces.  -- 2. New renderings released for Redefine the Drive  Earlier in 2023 we shared a series of before and after renderings from IDOT and CDOT that showed off the potential future conditions of an expanded North Jean-Baptiste Pointe DuSable Lake Shore Drive between Grand Ave and Hollywood Ave. The series of renderings garnered a huge turnout of readers and activity that extended onto social media and beyond. Stay tuned in 2024 for the decision of their preferred design plan for the redevelopment. -- 1. 400 Lake Shore Drive will begin construction in 45 days In October, Related Midwest hosted a construction logistics community meeting, in which they outlined their timeline for construction, which they said would begin 45 days after the occurrence of that meeting. As we wrap up the year, crews have begun clearing the site and mobilizing equipment. Crews will begin below-grade work, including caissons, sheeting, and the cofferdam. Work below-grade is expected to begin in Q1 of 2024 and run through Q2 2025. Once underground work is done, crews will transition to vertical construction, including concrete pours, the building enclosure, and interiors. Above-grade work will start in Q1 2025 and continue through Q2 2027. Landscaping and the final completion of the tower is expected for Q3 2027.  As the most-read article of the year, it is clear readers are very interested and eagerly awaiting more construction progress on this site, as are we! The article was also the third-highest viewed article across all of the Urbanize city pages. ",Citywide,0.0
First phase of Kennedy Expressway work wraps up,"IDOT has announced the completion of the first phase of the rehabilitation of the Kennedy Expressway, spanning from the Edens Expressway junction all the way down to W. Ohio St. This past year of construction focused on improvements to the inbound lanes and bridge rehabilitation work. Carved through the northwest neighborhoods of Chicago, the Kennedy Expressway opened back in 1960, with its latest major rehab dating back to 1994. IDOT claims the project will improve safety, traffic flow, and reliability for the more than 275,000 drivers who use the expressway every day.  In 2024, IDOT will close the reversible express lanes to modernize the system that controls the gates to the express lanes. Work on the bridge structures will be performed and pavement patching also be done. Mainline lane closures should also be expected for the installation of new LED lighting in both directions of Hubbard’s Cave. If crews can stick to the schedule, this second construction phase will wrap up by fall 2024.  The third construction season, planned for 2025, will focus on the outbound lanes. Two lanes will be closed at a time, with additional overnight and ramp closures needed to complete the work. To mitigate traffic during this season, the express lanes will be set for outbound traffic. Work on the LED lighting in Hubbard’s Cave will continue on the outbound lanes in this season as well. Like the first two years, crews are expected to finish this work by the fall of 2025. Projected to cost $150 million, the project will rehabilitate 36 bridge structures along the stretch, replace overhead signage, install new signs and LED lights, patch pavement, and perform structural painting. Additionally, the project will modernize the 52-year-old system that controls the gates to the express lanes and update Hubbard’s Cave with new paint and LED lighting. ",Citywide,0.0
CTA announces more scheduled service on select L lines,"The Chicago Transit Authority has announced that rail service is being added back to rail lines that saw recent, temporary reductions. The new scheduled service improves headways—the scheduled time between trains—which will result in shorter waits for riders, as well as increased reliability as the scheduled service reflects the available workforce. Effective as of yesterday, Monday, November 13, more frequent rail service will be scheduled on weekday Red, Orange and Pink Lines. Effective November 18, Saturday scheduled service on both the Brown and Orange lines will be increasing. “With the first phase of the track work on the Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line complete, we can now provide more service across the rail system,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “More service will be added in 2024 as we continue our aggressive efforts to hire and train more rail operators, which is the key to bringing back even more service.” According to the CTA, scheduled service improvements will be as follows: Weekday Saturday With the recent completion of work at Morgan Middle, a track-turnaround area along the Forest Park Branch near the UIC-Halsted station, Forest Park-bound Blue Line trains are now able to “short turn” at UIC-Halsted to head back north toward O’Hare. This puts more trains on the busiest parts of the Blue Line between downtown and O’Hare, helping to address issues of crowded trains and platforms due to increasing ridership. With Morgan Middle now available, O’Hare-bound train headways at UIC-Halsted will be scheduled every 6 -12 minutes instead of 10 -12 minutes weekdays between 6:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 6 - 7.5 minutes instead 10 minutes between 3:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. ",Citywide,0.0
Rental offerings expand outdoor fitness amenities,"With the Chicago summer weather in full swing, the amenity arms race has brought on a new offering in the latest luxury buildings as tenants prioritize health and well-being close to home. Designers and developers are responding to the trend by providing new fitness amenities that take the workout outside.   At Related Midwest’s The Row Fulton Market, the luxury rental tower’s amenity suite embraces the idea of outdoor entertainment and wellness. The Athletic Club and Wellness Studio provide renters with access to two separate terraces with a combination of hardscape and grassy surfaces that can be used for outdoor workouts. Yoga mats and select exercise equipment can be brought outside by tenants to use during their workout. Along the South Branch of the Chicago River, The Reed by Lendlease is both condos and apartments, with an expansive fitness center that offers wraparound views of the adjacent outdoor pool deck and 2-acre park to the north of the building. At the other end, the gym connects to an outdoor fitness terrace that is separate and can be used by individuals or groups. Further south, 1000 S. Clark features an outdoor track along the perimeter of the building on the amenity level of the building. Complementing the 10,000-square-foot fitness center and indoor/outdoor pool, the track equals 1 mile after 6 laps. ""The outdoor track was a true lifeline for our residents over the past few years when many recreational activities were limited, and it remains a hugely popular amenity today,"" said Diana Pittro, executive vice president of RMK Management Corp. As a small sampling of new rental offerings, these developments represent the shift towards health and well-being in the amenity offerings within the rental market in Chicago. Outdoor amenities and fitness spaces are becoming more and more common across the city. ",Citywide,0.0
"One Central study, underground development hits roadblock, and more","One Central megaproject study set to start as Dunn eyes $6.5 billion in state subsidies: At long last, the state of Illinois appears ready to begin a detailed study of whether the proposed One Central megaproject makes financial sense — a study that, depending on the results, could kill off the South Loop proposal once and for all or clear the way for developer Bob Dunn to get the $6.5 billion state subsidy he wants. The study will be conducted by a private group retained by the Illinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity. DCEO received bidders in January in response to a request for proposal and is expected to select a vendor soon. (Crain's Chicago Business) Ozingas’ underground development on Southeast Side may be dead due to mining ban: A massive underground warehouse development proposed for a long-dormant piece of former steel mill land on the Southeast Side may be dead on arrival as City Hall officials signal that a ban on mining likely prohibits the project from being approved. For more than two years, the Ozinga family, owners of the namesake concrete and materials business, has pushed the idea of a 6 million square foot commercial space below the surface that drops down 350 feet deep along the Calumet River near East 112th Street. (Chicago Sun-Times) Vintage business signs could be saved under proposed ordinance: In the 2012 book “Signs, Streets and Storefronts,” author Martin Treu wrote that old neon signs “often serve as important urban landmarks.” They “help to visually identify key locations in a city, marking them with distinct visual icons,” he wrote, and give streets “character and animation, reinforcing local history.” Mayor Brandon Johnson and his new City Council floor leader obviously agree. At Wednesday’s Council meeting, Johnson introduced an ordinance aimed at protecting Chicago’s most iconic “vintage signs,” including the Grace’s Furniture sign in Logan Square. (Chicago Sun-Times) Austin’s Landmarked Seth Warner Home, One Of Chicago's Oldest, Damaged In Fire: One of Chicago’s oldest homes caught fire early Thursday, injuring a firefighter in the process. The fire occurred at 631 N. Central Ave. with the roof suffering extensive damage, Fire Department officials said. The owner, civil rights attorney James Bowers, was asleep at home with his wife when the fire started. The couple managed to escape unharmed with their four cats, he said. Two neighbors across the street say they saw fire from the top of the roof around 1:30 a.m. Thursday, lasting for roughly an hour. Fire Department officials said one firefighter was hospitalized and is in good condition. No other injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is not yet known, officials said. The home was built by abolitionist Seth Warner in 1869 and designated last year as a Chicago landmark. (Block Club Chicago) ",Citywide,0.0
CTA set to get $200 million for new trains,"The Federal Transit Administration announced that the Chicago Transit Authority will be receiving $200 million in federal funding to replace aging railcars in the fleet to improve reliability, safety and accessibility. Funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the money is coming from the new Rail Vehicle Replacement Program, which was created to improve safety, service, and the customer experience on subways, commuter rail, and light rail systems.  ""Every day, millions of Americans rely on subways, commuter rail, and light rail to get to work or school, buy groceries, and see loved ones, but many railcars still in service are decades old and in need of replacement,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. ""These grants will help bring riders faster, safer, more reliable service on America’s rails."" For the CTA, the new funding provides the opportunity to buy up to 300 new electric propulsion passenger railcars to replace railcars that have been operating since the 1980s. This project will improve CTA’s state of good repair needs in a fleet where the average age of its railcars is nearly 40 years. Exact details about the features of the new cars and timing of their delivery are currently unknown. ",Citywide,0.0

Photos: Peek inside the newly completed Tribune Tower condos,"After paying $240 million for Chicago's famous Tribune Tower in 2016, co-developers CIM Group and Golub & Company are finally ready to take the wraps off their multiyear conversion of the landmark 1925 neo-Gothic skyscraper into luxury condominiums. Urbanize Chicago was invited for a sneak peek of the renovation project, overseen by architecture firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz.  The tour began in the development's more contemporary lobby off of Illinois Street. This area led to a bank of elevators for the northern wing of the Tribune complex (the former WGN TV building), which has received a four-story vertical addition to house more condos. From there, a longer-than-expected hallway lined with art zig-zagged southwest to the tower's historic Michigan Avenue lobby. Home to the ""Hall of Inscriptions"" featuring quotes about the press from Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, and others, this lobby is mostly untouched since it was the only interior portion of the building included in the property's landmark designation. The only noticeable changes are some new lounge furniture and more art. According to the development team, the entire project contains $1 million worth of custom commissioned artwork. Next, we headed to the third-floor amenity level. Here, the so-called ""great room"" includes a large kitchen for entertaining and multiple seating areas that can be used to socialize or work. One such nook, dubbed ""McCormick's study,"" has the original fireplace salvaged from the 24th-floor office of former Chicago Trib owner Col. Robert McCormick.  The third-floor great room opens out onto a nearly one-third-acre private park with lush landscaping and meandering walking paths. Since many residences have private terraces directly overlooking this courtyard, the elevated park has no seating or grills to keep things tranquil. The more active outdoor amenities are located elsewhere in the building. The historic tower's main lobby hall is two and a half stories high, so the western portion of the third-floor amenities features a split-level design. A short flight of stairs connects to the game room with darts and billiards and a pair of private meeting rooms overlooking yet another seating area called the ""Pioneer Court library.""  The next stop was the tower's striking 25th-floor amenity level which is home to a curving terrace that wraps nearly 360 degrees around the building's crown. The space offers outdoor seating, grilling stations, an herb garden, and impressive views of the city and lake between the tower's Gothic flying buttresses. The interior of the 25th floor includes additional lounge seating, a full catering kitchen, and a place to eat if your picnic on the terrace suddenly gets rained out. The amenities keep going on the seventh floor, where residents can enjoy a south-facing sun deck behind the iconic ""Chicago Tribune"" sign and more outdoor grilling stations. This space overlooks Pioneer Court, which is in the midst of its own makeover as part of the Tribune Tower redevelopment. The seventh floor's 75-foot indoor lap pool was still under construction during our walk-through, so snapping photos was off-limits. We also swung by the second-floor fitness center, spa, locker rooms, golf simulator, and indoor putting green. The final stop was Tribune Tower's sales gallery, located in one of the unsold residences. As expected, the condos deliver top-notch finishes, high-end kitchens, and crown moldings throughout. The complex contains 162 for-sale units priced from $900,000 to over $7 million. According to sales director Jeanne Martini, seventy of the condos are under contract, of which 55 have closed. The first owners moved in on June 30, she said. Construction work is ongoing at the tower's base, which will reopen as new retail space. CIM and Golub have already secured a long-term commitment from the Museum of Ice Cream to occupy 13,000 square feet in the tower. Crews are also putting the finishing touches on renovations to Nathan Hale Court along Michigan Avenue. The famous bronze statue of Nathan Hale will be making a return to his namesake courtyard, but poor Mr. Hale is currently entombed in a wooden box marked ""top-heavy."" With the Tribune Tower renovation all but complete, CIM and Golub can next turn their attention to the project's second phase: a 1,422-foot skyscraper slated to rise at the vacant parcel located just to the east of the historic tower (formerly a Tribune employee parking lot). It's unclear when the developers intend to break ground on the ""Tribune East"" supertall, which won city zoning approval in 2020. ",Downtown,0.0
Photos: BMO Tower nearing completion next to Union Station,"Workers are putting the finishing touches on downtown's 50-story BMO Tower (also known as Union Station Tower) ahead of the Class A building's anticipated January 2022 opening. Since topping off its concrete core in April, the high-rise at 320 S. Canal Street has received the rest of its structural steel. The 730-foot structure is almost entirely wrapped in glass except for its exterior skip hoist.  Much of the remaining exterior work is focused at the tower's base, where crews from Clark Construction are cladding the V-shaped columns flanking the lobby. Work also continues on the 400-car, two-level parking garage located just west of the tower that will eventually be topped by a 1.5-acre publicly accessible park.  Canada-based BMO Financial Group is signed on to occupy 500,000 square feet in its upcoming 1.5 million-square-foot namesake Chicago skyscraper, developed by Riverside Investment & Development and Convexity Properties and designed by architecture firm Goettsch Partners. The glassy tower replaces an Amtrak parking garage which closed in late 2019.  In addition to developing BMO Tower, the Riverside-Convexity team also has city zoning approval to convert the upper floors of the historic Union Station headhouse across the street into 400 hotel rooms. There's been no word on when that project will begin construction. ",Downtown,0.0
Two-tower development slated for 601 W. Monroe adds public dog park,"Vancouver-based Pacific Reach Properties has further refined its plans for a pair of 47- and 40-story high-rise apartment towers at 601 W. Monroe Street. If approved, the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed development would bring 1,053 rental units, 30,000 square feet of retail, and 430 parking spaces to a 1.5-acre site in the West Loop Gate, currently occupied by a surface parking lot. The latest raft of changes includes the addition of a 3,000-square-foot publicly accessible dog park next to Heritage Green Park. Additionally, the ground-floor setback on South Desplaines Street has increased four feet to boost the sidewalk width to nearly 20 feet, according to a recent email from the office of Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd). The developer has also agreed to ""numerous commitments"" to keep neighbors happy during construction, the email said. Putting pressure on a developer to provide a public dog park is hardly a new move for Ald. Reilly, who has previously advocated for canine amenities at Exhibit apartments in River North and the One Bennett Park development in Streeterville. The fact that little else about the proposal has changed since breaking cover in Februrary is an encouraging sign that Pacific Reach Properties is likely close to earning the alderman's blessing for 601 W. Monroe. The proposal will also require the support of the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards and City Council before work can begin. The developer will also be on the hook for a $5.5 million contribution to the city's Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, which supports economic investment in underserved communities on the city's South and West sides. If city approvals go as planned, Pacific Reach aims to break ground on the taller 47-story east tower in early 2022 and deliver the building in mid-2024. The 40-story western tower would open in 2025, an executive at Pacific Reach told the Chicago Tribune earlier this year. ",Downtown,1.0
Photos: Mixed-use Michigan Avenue tower climbs skyward near Millennium Park,"Work on the upcoming mixed-use high-rise at 300 N. Michigan Avenue is really flying. The estimated $250 million project broke ground last summer in the thick of the global pandemic, and by our rough floor count is well past the halfway point to achieving its 47-story, 523-foot final height. The tower's climbing formwork is even visible from the main branch of the Chicago River.  A joint venture between hometown developers Sterling Bay and Magellan Development Group, the project will include 25,000 square feet of retail space topped by a 280-room CitizenM Hotel occupying floors 6 through 15. Above the hotel, there will be 289 rental apartments and a top-floor amenity terrace for residents offering views of Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, and Lake Michigan. The transit-oriented development will include just 22 parking spaces located in a below-grade garage. Designed by Chicago-based bKL Architecture, 300 N. Michigan is wrapped in a glass facade with horizontal banding. Its most striking feature is a series of angled structural trusses between the retail and hotel levels which earned the project the nickname the ""M&M building"" by Urbanize Chicago photographer Harry Carmicheal. The development even incorporates the beam geometry into its ""300 N. Michigan"" logo, seen posted just above the ground-floor scaffolding.  The development team is providing seven units of affordable housing on-site and contributing $4 million to the Affordable Housing Fund and $3.9 million for Chicago’s Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, which will be reinvested in the city’s underserved communities. Linn-Mathes serves as general contractor.  The high-rise replaces an older four-story masonry structure which was demolished in 2019. If there's a downside to the new development, it's that it will soon block views of the iconic Art Deco Carbide & Carbon Building from the Michigan Avenue Bridge—so soak up that perspective while you still have the chance.  According to Sterling Bay, 300 N. Michigan is on track for June 2022 occupancy. When the downtown tower opens, it will bring more activity to the already bustling section of Michigan Avenue between Millennium Park and the Chicago River that some have dubbed the ""Millennium Mile."" It will join relatively recent projects such as the MILA apartments, LondonHouse, and the Hotel Julian. ",Downtown,0.0
"Downtown high-rise proposal with more than 1,000 apartments moves forward","A proposal from Vancouver-based Pacific Reach Properties for a pair of glassy apartment towers at 601 W. Monroe Street is forging ahead in the city's approval process after the developer filed a recent zoning application for the West Loop Gate project. Rising 47 and 40 stories (535 and 465 feet, respectively) atop a shared podium, the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed towers would bring 1,053 rental units, 30,000 square feet of retail, and 430 parking spaces to a 1.5-acre site located between the four Presidential Towers, Heritage Green Park, and Old St. Patrick’s Church. The location is currently home to a surface parking lot.  The two-phase proposal was first revealed by Ald. Brendan Reilly in a February 19 newsletter to neighbors. Reilly said the developer had been working on the proposal since 2018 and the team incorporated a number of changes at the alderman's request. Revisions include cutting the towers down from their original heights of 54 and 47 stories, eliminating a hotel component, increasing retail space, and slightly curbing the amount of parking. The project falls under the city's existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) which requires projects that receive a zoning change to provide 10 percent affordable housing (an updated version of the ordinance takes effect in October and bumps the requirements to 20 percent for downtown projects). Pacific Reach will provide seven of its required 105 affordable units on-site and satisfy the remainder of its obligation by paying into the city's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund, according to the application. The developers will also pay the city $5.5 million for a density bonus.  Mark Marshall, senior vice president of development and construction at Pacific Reach, told the Chicago Tribune in February that his company was ""definitely optimistic"" about the apartment market rebounding post-COVID. If approvals go as planned, the developer aims to break ground on the taller 47-story east tower in early 2022 and deliver the building in mid-2024. The 40-story western tower would open in 2025, Marshall told the newspaper.  Though not quite as ""booming"" as Fulton Market to the west, the area between the Chicago River and Kennedy Expressway is seeing an impressive share of real estate activity. Recent office projects like the adaptive reuse of the Old Post Office will be joined by upcoming commercial developments like BMO Tower and 609 W. Randolph Street. Construction is currently underway on a 373-unit apartment development at 354 N. Union Avenue , and the Chicago Plan Commission recently approved a 413-unit rental tower for the parking lot at 640 W. Washington Boulevard.     ",Downtown,1.0
Architects envision new intermodal riverwalk for Chicago River's south branch,"Chicago-area design firm DMAC Architecture has revealed an ambitious vision for bringing new open space and a riverwalk to the south branch of the Chicago River. Located just east of the office building at 300 S. Riverside Plaza, the concept was created in response to Amtrak's concept to reactivate an unused platform near Union Station and add egress stairs to street level. DMAC, working with property owner Third Millennium Group, saw the situation as a chance to create something special. ""We felt there is a solution for egress that can be satisfied in a much better way,"" DMAC founder and principal Dwayne MacEwen told Urbanize. ""You can't make this the 'back door' to Union Station. It should be the front door to the city and river. Chicago exists where it does because of the river. To not embrace it seemed like a missed opportunity."" The concept treats the need for new stairs as a starting point to extend a perimeter walkway around 300 S. Riverside and potentially down to the waterfront with a series of ramps. The upper terrace is envisioned as an outdoor dining area, while the lower levels serve as public gathering spaces and piers that could be used by kayakers, tour boats, and floating ""tree taxi"" islands. The walkways would allow train passengers to emerge from Union Station at river level, while an acoustic ""veil"" and baffle in front of the platforms would help absorb sound. A proposed pedestrian connection would pass beneath the Van Buren Street Bridge and provide access to the redeveloped Old Post Office property.  The landscaping takes inspiration from the location's existing features, which include wild vegetation growing on remnants of the sea caves—a series of sunken waterfront tunnels leftover when engineers reversed the flow of the Chicago River in 1900. The concept also takes advantage of intermodal connectivity at the site, which is served by trains, buses, boats, bicycles, and even helipads on the roof of 300 S. Riverside. Described by Third Millennium Group managing director Adam Mizrachi as a ""love letter to Chicago,"" the so-called Riverwalk@300SRP plan is still very much in the concept phase. Its designers hope renderings of the project can start a conversation about how to make it a reality.  ""This is a 'love letter,' so we're not at the altar yet,"" said MacEwen. ""Developers often look at a project from the standpoint of how it impacts the bottom line, but this is something that the city should want to do.""  ""It's ambitious, we know,"" added the architect. ""But there's also a sense that if phase one is adding the egress stairs from the train platform, let's do it in a way that still allows [the riverwalk] to happen later.""  Amtrak spokesperson Marc Magliari confirmed that have been discussions about activating the unused tracks under the Old Post Office as passenger platforms serving Union Station, but challenges remain and no decision has been made.  ""These tracks were designed to connect to the Old Post Office and not Union Station, so riders would have to cross active tracks to get to them,"" Magliari told Urbanize. ""We have to find a way to solve the issues of getting people from the station to the platform in a safe and accessible way."" Magliari also noted that nearby developments such as Bank of America Tower, Southbank, and The 78 already provide riverwalks on the opposite bank of the river. ""There's the question of where the city intends to build a continuous riverwalk for the south branch,"" Magliari said. This post has been updated with additional information from Amtrak.

BMO Tower tops off across from Union Station,"After breaking ground in late 2019, construction on downtown's upcoming 730-foot-tall BMO Tower topped off on Thursday. Although the 50-story building's steel skeleton and glass curtain wall still need to play catch up, the skyscraper's concrete core has reached its final height. A special beam signed by construction workers was hoisted to the top of the structure to mark the milestone.  To make the official topping-off that much more official, crews from Clark Construction were joined by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who touted the development for the 1,500 union jobs it created and the 6,000 office workers who will eventually call the building home. BMO Tower (also known as Union Station Tower) is located at 320 S. Canal Street, just south of the Union Station headhouse and transit center. Development partners Riverside Investment & Development and Convexity Properties were selected to revitalize the station and surrounding Amtrak-owned real estate in 2017.  In addition to developing BMO Tower (which replaced an older Amtrak parking garage), the team also has city approval to eventually convert the upper floors of the historic station into 400 hotel rooms. Chicago-based Goettsch Partners designed the newly topped-off high-rise. It features a glassy facade with vertical striping and large chevron-shaped structural supports at its base. The project also includes a 1.5-acre publicly accessible park atop a 400-car parking garage located just west of the tower. The finished skyscraper is expected to welcome tenants in January 2022. Canada-based BMO Financial Group is signed on to occupy 500,000 square feet in its new 1.5 million-square-foot namesake Chicago skyscraper. Like the Salesforce-anchored office building under construction at Wolf Pont, BMO Tower will face a vastly different office market than when it was originally conceived. The rise of the pandemic and remote work has many companies reevaluating their space needs, and BMO Tower could contribute to a potential glut of unleased space.  The project is located kitty-corner from the massive Old Post Office which was renovated into a whopping 2.8 million square feet of office space in 2019.   ",Downtown,0.0
Photos: Checking in on Salesforce Tower at Wolf Point,"Roughly a year after breaking ground along the banks of the Chicago River, downtown's Salesforce Tower is more than 20 floors in the air. The building's concrete core continues to soar skyward and workers have been installing structural steel beams for the past several weeks. Developer Hines Interests and crews from Walsh Construction started work on the $800 million project in April 2020 and have persevered through the pandemic, stay-at-home orders, and economic uncertainty.  The 60-story, 820-foot-tall office tower represents the third and final phase of the three-building Wolf Point Development. It is flanked by the existing 485-foot Wolf Point West apartments and the 660-foot Wolf Point East rental high-rise. Designed by architecture firm Pelli Clarke Pelli, Salesforce Tower Chicago features a glassy curtain wall facade, underground parking, and a continuation of Wolf Point's publicly accessible riverwalk.  Anchor tenant Salesforce will occupy 500,000 square feet in the 1.2 million-square-foot building. The deal gives the company not only naming rights for the tower previously known as Wolf Point South, but also corporate signage at its crown.  The riverfront skyscraper is on pace to finish construction by the end of 2022 and welcome its first tenants in early 2023. In the meantime, downtown Chicago's office market grapples with COVID-related record vacancies and the growing work-from-home trend. Upcoming developments like Salesforce Tower and the 1.5 million-square-foot BMO Tower (under construction near Union Station) will add even more supply to the mix. It's entirely possible that these projects may be the last new office skyscrapers to break ground in Chicago for some time.   ",Downtown,0.0
Big changes are coming to Chicago's affordable housing ordinance,"At Wednesday's City Council meeting, Mayor Lori Lightfoot introduced her long-awaited proposal to overhaul Chicago's affordable housing requirements in new development projects. The existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) requires residential developments with 10 or more units to set aside a portion of apartments or condos as affordable housing. Projects that are subject to Chicago's ARO include developments that receive a zoning change, financial assistance, or land from the city. Under the current rules, developments that come under the ARO are required to build 10 percent affordable units or pay what are called ""in-lieu"" fees that the city uses to fund other affordable housing programs. Since the policy went into effect in 2007, it has generated $124 million of in-lieu payments but produced only 1,049 affordable residences (as of last year).  The revised ordinance boosts the affordability requirements to 20 percent in developments located downtown, in neighborhoods with low levels of affordable housing, and in so-called ""community preservation areas"" facing displacement of low-income residents. Some areas of the city, such as the West Loop, have already adopted a 20 percent requirement as part of a pilot program enacted by the city in 2017. Under Lightfoot's proposed ordinance, developers can still opt out of building units on-site, but the in-lieu payment fees will increase. At least 50 percent of units are required to be built (either on-site, off-site, or across a combination of the two), which is an increase from the 25 percent required under the current ARO. Off-site units can now be built in any area of the city as long as it is lacking affordable housing. And if a project triggers ARO requirements in a transit-oriented development (TOD), any off-site units must also be located in a similar transit-served area. Additionally, the ordinance requires builders to provide more units for residents earning below the 60 percent area median income (AMI) ""affordability"" threshold established under the previous rules. Developers that decrease that threshold for lower-income residents can build fewer units. The revised rules also include incentives to provide larger family-sized affordable-rate units. ""As city leaders, it is our responsibility to step up and do the work to reverse the adverse effects segregation has had on our city,"" said Mayor Lightfoot in a statement Wednesday. ""These effects, which include disinvestment, gentrification, and a historic life expectancy gap, are at odds with our values of equity and inclusion. ""Thanks to this ordinance, we will be able to better address these negative impacts and move our city that much closer to fully ensuring that all of our residents, regardless of their income, will have the ability and opportunity to live wherever they choose in Chicago."" Lightfoot's proposal incorporates many findings and recommendations from the Department of Housing Inclusionary Housing Task Force. According to a report published by the task force in September, Chicago faces an estimated citywide shortage of nearly 120,000 affordable homes. While few dismiss the problems caused by the city's shortfall of affordable housing, real estate developers have generally cautioned against raising the ARO requirements, arguing that it could make it more difficult to finance new construction. If too restrictive, the new rules could have the opposite effect. Projects that can't get off the ground won't be able to generate any new units of affordable housing or pay the in-lieu fees that bring vital funding to many of the city's other affordable housing initiatives.  Mayor Lightfoot's plan will need to strike a delicate balance to achieve its goal of bringing more affordable housing to the neighborhoods that need it the most.  If the ARO requirements are indeed set too high, we might see a flood of developers rushing projects through city hall before the new rules go into effect.  ",Downtown,0.0
2678 W. Washington is officially a Chicago landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation of the house and dormitory at 2678 W. Washington. The property at 2678 W. Washington includes a large residential building with an attached dormitory and a free-standing coach house set on a large lot in East Garfield Park. The house is a fine example of Queen Anne architecture, and the attached dormitory was designed by the noted Chicago architecture firm of Holabird & Roche. Both are rich in the history of institutions that cared for Chicago’s women and children in need.  2678 W. Washington served a critical role in providing care and opportunity to Chicago’s most vulnerable, including women and children who could not afford health care after being discharged from hospitals; homeless, destitute, or otherwise abandoned women without options; abused and neglected adolescent girls; unwed mothers and their children; and the larger homeless population of the city.  The buildings have served as a care facility under four different organizations, including the Chicago Home for Convalescent Women & Children, the Florence Crittenton Anchorage, the Volunteers of America’s Living Center for Girls, and Inner Voice, Inc. as the need for social services in the neighborhood and city evolved.  The main house is an excellent example of a residential building in the Queen Anne architectural style. Built circa 1880, through a series of remodelings, the building was transformed from a small frame dwelling to a brick mansion. The complex roofline with front-facing gable and dormers, asymmetric composition, corner tower with conical bay, decorative richness and variety, and projecting bays exemplify the style.  The dormitory and its sympathetic later addition reflect the Italian Renaissance and French Eclectic period styles popular in the 1920s during the second phase of the Eclectic movement in America. The building features distinctive masonry and stucco detailing with dark red brick window surrounds and quoining contrasting with flat, white fields of stucco. These unusual design motifs reflect the Eclectic movement’s preference for “correct” architectural detail and give the building a distinctive presence in the East Garfield Park Community Area. The dormitory was designed by the noted Chicago architecture firm of Holabird & Roche whose founders were recognized as major, innovative, and prolific practitioners of the Chicago School of architecture. The successor firm of Holabird & Root and then Holabird, Root & McGee, the firm responsible for the 1948 addition to and remodeling of the dormitory, continued to shape the look of the City of Chicago over the course of the twentieth century and they remain a major contributor to the city’s architectural excellence. Meeting the separate Integrity Criterion, the main house retains the same form, location, design, setting, and majority of materials in place since its last major remodeling in 1910 during the period of significance. Some windows and doors have been replaced, but this is typical for buildings of this vintage. Exterior work from 2017 appears to have involved the replacement of the dentillated pressed metal cornice at the top of the second floor with flat bands of siding, but the overall impact is not enough to interfere with the home’s historic appearance. The dormitory also maintains the same form, location, design, setting, and majority of materials in place since its last major remodeling in 1948 during the period of significance. There are isolated patches of stucco loss and masonry failure, but these can be repaired. Windows and doors have also been replaced but this alone is not enough to detract from the historic appearance. The landmark designation will protect all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the main house and dormitory as well as the 2011 bronze “Passage” sculpture. The current location of the ""Passage"" sculpture is not integral to the site’s historic configuration, so the statue may be relocated elsewhere on the site.  ",East Garfield Park,0.0

CDC approves TIF for BandWith Chicago,"The Community Development Commission has approved TIF funding for the redevelopment of a formerly industrial building into the new headquarters of BandWith Chicago. Located at 134 S. California, the project site is located along S. California Ave stretching from W. Wilcox St down to W. Adams St. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the redevelopment will renovate the 21,460-square foot building into the headquarters of BandWith Chicago. The organization provides educational, rehearsal and performance spaces for music and dance students enrolled in their programs. The renovation will also include retail space for Dark Matter Coffee and separate administrative offices for Deborah’s Place, an organization which provides social services to homeless women. The approximately $12.4 million development will be funded with $2.5 million in grants, $1.3 million in debt from Wintrust Bank, $1.8 million from a capital campaign, $1.85 million in New Market Tax Credits, and $5 million in TIF funding. 50% of the TIF funding from the city would be paid out upon completion of the project, with the final 50% paid out one year after the completion of the development. With the Community Development Commission’s approval, the redevelopment agreement that outlines the proposed TIF funding will be finalized before moving to City Hall to get a final approval from City Council. If approved, construction would begin in March 2024 and be completed in January 2025.  ",East Garfield Park,1.0
Final landmark recommendation approved for 2678 W. Washington,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the house and dormitory at 2678 W. Washington.

Building permit issued for first phase of Garfield Green,"A full building permit has been issued for the first phase of the Garfield Green affordable housing development. Originally proposed as one of the submissions to the C40 Reinventing Cities competition in 2018, the venture led by POAH was selected as the winner in May 2019. The site is located at 3155 W. Fifth Ave, fronting both S. Kedzie Ave and W. Fifth Ave.  Garfield Green will be a carbon-neutral multifamily housing development that will bring a total of 82 units of affordable rental and for-sale housing stock to the East Garfield Park neighborhood. The mixed-use buildings will feature ground floor retail and commercial space fronting S. Kedzie Ave, with residential units setback from the street. The first building, planned for the southern parcel on the south side of W. 5th Ave, will deliver 43 rental units, including a unit mix of 15 one-beds, 19 two-beds, and 9 three-bedroom units. The affordable units will utilize an income-averaging plan, with some units at 30% AMI, 60% AMI, and 80% AMI. 11 of the units will have an additional subsidy from the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund. 4,500 square feet of commercial space will front S. Kedzie Ave. Residential amenities will include terraces, an exercise room, community room, rooftop gardening boxes, and 15 parking spaces. With a design from Perkins & Will and Nia Architects, the phase 1 building will be a three-story structure built of wood and steel frame construction. Roofs and walls will be well-insulated with high-performing insulated glass windows to achieve Passive House status. Green roofs will aid in cooling and allow for enhanced stormwater absorption. The building’s orientation has been designed to maximize solar heat gain for natural heating and cooling.

Committee on Design reviews Hub 32,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the mixed-use eTOD dubbed Hub 32. Recently announced as the winner of the East Garfield Park RFQ, the winning design will occupy a currently vacant parcel owned by the city at 132 N. Kedzie. The $47.2 million project is being planned by The Michaels Organization, KMW Communities, and TruDelta. Hub32 looks to connect to the surrounding neighborhood through community wealth building and by creating a place for local entrepreneurs to thrive. With Brooks + Scarpa working in collaboration with Studio Dwell Architects, the architecture is inspired by the idea of a quilt, taking pieces or aspects of the community and stitching them together. Designed as a set of buildings within a building, the broken-down scale fits the community using a fresh perspective on a typical courtyard-style building. The design maximizes daylight and views while providing a large common green space.   Set to rise seven floors, the mixed-use building will include 63 apartments for those earning up to 60% AMI. The rental units will be broken down into 14 one-beds, 34 two-beds, and 15 three-beds. The ground floor will include 5,600 square feet of retail space for three smaller tenants, prioritizing small food-based businesses rather than a large, big box retailer. A plaza will be designed to offer space for outdoor dining and community gathering, with the development also including 16 parking spaces. Retail tenants are expected to include Jerky Jerk Caribbean restaurant and Vietfive Coffee. The building’s massing will comprise of a taller element along the L tracks and a shorter volume along the south side of the site. Separated by a courtyard, the outdoor space will reinforce the courtyard building motif, with additional private terraces carving the massing. To add richness and depth to the building, the facades have been designed with inset windows and outset frames. The material palette of the project will clad the southern volume and base in a light-colored brick, while the taller tower element will be clad in metal paneling with inset accent panels mimicking wood. At the ground floor, the south corner has been carved out to create a community space, while the remainder of the N. Kedzie Ave frontage will be clad in storefront glazing to activate the street. Two small retail spaces will look onto the outdoor community space, with the residential entry located midway along the street frontage. A bike room and the final retail space will round out the rest of the project’s street frontage along N. Kedzie Ave. The discussion kicked off with Reed Kroloff who first asked whether the south building has an elevator to get to the upper floors. The design team responded that there needs to be one and they are resolving circulation and exiting issues. Kroloff then questioned whether the design is getting to a point where there are too many materials, wondering if the project could benefit from a less active material palette to enhance the contrast between volumes. The design team responded that a lot will be refined and changed as the design progresses and the budget will be considered as it applies to materials on the building. Catherine Baker chimed in next, wondering if the design team could switch around the programs on the ground floor to activate the north corner of the site along W. Lake St. Baker also questioned whether there could be an opportunity to activate W. Maypole Ave which is currently an odd, neglected street. The design team responded that they certainly want to activate W. Maypole Ave and are working every way they can to do that. The developers chimed in to discuss the fact that they feel they cannot activate all of these street frontages at once and are focusing on N. Kedzie Ave to activate the commercial street and intersection at the south end of the site. Andre Brumfield spoke next, commending them on a very good-looking building and creating an icon for the neighborhood. Brumfield asked how far the overhang of the northern tower is, saying that it seemed extreme and like an engineering feat. The design team responded that they have been working very quickly and expect changes going forward while trying to maintain the design intent.  Jackie Koo commented next, reinforcing the idea that the design should embrace W. Lake St and the L as an iconic part of Chicago. Koo suggested that the corner be activated with a community room or other programming to let people engage with the L. The developers responded that their design looks to use large north-facing windows to engage with the L by allowing residents to watch the trains going by. Currently there are a lot of low-rise industrial buildings along W. Lake St and they felt that retail under the L would be a great challenge they don't want to pursue.  Guacolda Reyes chimed in next to challenge the development team to bring energy to W. Lake St considering how important the L is for Chicago. Reinforcing the idea that it would be a missed opportunity without activation, Reyes suggested they change the bike room and add windows to create a welcoming space. Reyes’ final comment was that she worried about the type of materials and their cost in building this type of project. The design team responded that they have a track record of building affordable projects with materials that look too expensive and are very judicious about developing techniques in the design to get the most bang for their buck. The developers chimed in to say they know it will be an expensive project and will be looking to refine this preliminary plan in the next 4-6 months to reach a resolved project design and scope. Reed Kroloff jumped back in at the end to vouch for Brooks and Scarpa’s ability to budget and commented on how there would certainly be many ways to trim costs and still achieve the project’s design intent. Kroloff encouraged the developers to push the design and take on the challenge of the project for this site.    Moving forward, the development will continue through the city approval process. City support for the proposal may include Tax Increment Financing, tax credits, zoning, a land write-down, or other forms of assistance. Construction could start by early 2024.  ",East Garfield Park,1.0

DPD reveals East Garfield Park RFQ designs,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has revealed the three proposals competing in the East Garfield Park RFQ process. Produced by development and design teams that responded to a DPD Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in August 2022, the projects are vying for the chance to develop vacant, city-owned land at W. Lake St and N. Kedzie Ave. According to the RFP, the land consists of Sites 1, 2 and 3, each of which represent unique opportunities for the neighborhood. The parcels have the potential to create a well-integrated mixed-use development that enhances the vibrancy of the Garfield Park community as well as to implement eTOD principles that enable people the ability to experience the benefits of dense, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented development near transit hubs. The project will also expand retail, dining, and neighborhood amenities so that residents can access most of their basic, day-to-day needs within a 15-minute walk of their homes. As part of the process, design excellence is being promoted to ensure development is consistent with the unique context of neighborhood, corridors, and blocks. The first proposal comes from the development trifecta of The Michaels Organization, KMW Communities and TruDelta. Dubbed Hub32, the project looks to connect to the surrounding neighborhood through community wealth building and creating a place for local entrepreneurs to thrive. With Brooks + Scarpa working in collaboration with Studio Dwell Architects, the architecture is inspired by the idea of a quilt, taking pieces or aspects of the community and stitching them together. Designed as a set of buildings within a building, the broken-down scale fits the community using a fresh perspective on a typical courtyard-style building.

The rental units will be broken down into 14 one-beds, 34 two-beds, and 15 three-beds. The ground floor will include 5,600 square feet of retail space for three smaller tenants, prioritizing small food-based businesses rather than a large, big box retailer. A plaza will be designed to offer space for outdoor dining and community gathering, with the development also including 16 parking spaces. Watch their video here: Hub 32 -- The second proposal comes from solo developer Citizens Building a Better Community (CBBC). Designed by JGMA and Productora, the architecture looks to transform the entire intersection, envisioning a project that creates space for more than just housing. The architecture is based on two ideas, including the idea of the conservatory as a social space. Nurturing and promoting growth, the building features a central winter garden and lush atrium in place of the typical double-loaded corridor. Full of vegetation, it promotes social interaction as a green spine that connects from street level all the way up to the roof.  The second influence was the rich history of Garfield Park. Positing that contemporary architecture works best when it takes into account the local history, the facades have been designed with depth and movement that generates windows that are not just perpendicular to the street, but also diagonal. The upper floor sets back to reduce the overall height of the volume and the first floor is fully commercial space to promote an active street front. Working with landscape architects Botanical City, the project will include widened sidewalks and flexible corners with open space for people to gather, shop, and dine outdoors.  Set to rise six floors, the mixed-use building will include 52 residential units, broken down into 30 one-beds and 22 two-beds, all for those making up to 60% AMI. The ground floor will host 6,030 square feet of retail space for three tenants, potentially including a sit-down restaurant, laundromat, and cafe. Six parking spaces will be included.  Watch their video here: CBBC -- The final proposal comes from the partnership of Evergreen Real Estate Group and Imagine Development Group. Designed by Lorcan O'Herlihy Architects and HED Architects, the project seeks to be a bridge between the existing neighborhood and the vision of the area’s future. As an opportunity to engage with the neighborhood, the proposal looks to support community growth through place making architecture, enhancing the context and providing the best living spaces for residents.  The building’s massing rotates away from the train to separate it from the Green Line station, with green roof decks that are carved into the massing adding social space. Texture has been added to animate the facade, bringing the building into scale with the neighborhood. The project creates a landscaped street and buffer from the train, with widened sidewalks and an activated place to collect commuters, residents, and business patrons as they come from the Green Line.  Rising 7 floors, the mixed-use building will include 60 residential units, split into 36 one-beds, 18 two-bed, and 4 three-beds. The last two dwellings will be for-sale townhomes. Each residential floor will have a laundry room and lounge with direct access to the outdoors. A system of green roofs act as an amenity for the residents while reducing thermal transfer and increasing on-site water retention. A PV array on the roof will support 100% of the building's energy needs. The ground floor of the building will include 1,700 square feet of space for a local or start-up business as well as the public plaza adjacent to the CTA station entrance. Parking for 32 cars will also be provided.  Watch their video here: Evergreen/Imagine -- With DPD looking to engage the community and received feedback, you can take a survey here at this link: Community Survey DPD will likely hold a public meeting, with time and location to be determined.

Harrison Row Townhomes launch phase 2,"Structured Development has announced the launch of the second phase of Harrison Row Townhomes, an affordable for-sale townhome community at W. Harrison St and S. Francisco Ave in East Garfield Park. A total of 33 new three-bedroom townhomes will be added, including 14 duplex townhomes, or 28 units, built using modular construction. Priced from $245,000 and created under Chicago’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO), the homes will be built in phases over the course of the year and reserved for households earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income. Buyers will be sourced through the Chicago Community Land Trust (CCLT), a nonprofit corporation administered and staffed by the Chicago Department of Housing that seeks to preserve the long-term affordability of homes created through city of Chicago programs, including the ARO. Chicago-based Kinexx Modular Construction will assemble the modular townhomes off-site in its Southwest Side factory, significantly reducing the construction timeline for each home to approximately 90 days, including on-site installation. Kinexx is the first company to design, build and install a modular home in Chicago, with plans customized to the city’s typical lot size. Harrison Row is the first townhome application of the company’s modular designs. The idea to explore modular for Harrison Row’s second phase originated from Fain’s LLC, a Black-owned development firm based in East Garfield Park. Led by Kevin Brinson and Quentin “Q” Addison, who both grew up in the neighborhood, Fain’s originally specialized in renovations and other contracting work before shifting its focus to development. Following an introduction by 27th Ward Ald. Walter Burnett Jr., Fain’s began receiving mentorship from Structured Development on the first phase of Harrison Row and is now a partner on two of the units in phase two. As part of the ownership group, Fain’s will share in the fee revenues and profit and losses while gaining the foundation to develop projects independently in the future. Structured Development is fulfilling part of its ARO obligations for The Shops at Big Deahl, a mixed-use, mixed-income community the firm is developing at the southeast corner of Blackhawk and Kingsbury streets in Lincoln Park.   ",East Garfield Park,0.0

City commission approves supportive housing project in East Garfield Park,"This week, the Chicago Community Development Commission signed off on $3.5 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) to support the construction of a four-story affordable housing project in East Garfield Park. Dubbed the ""Conservatory Apartments,"" the new building will replace a vacant lot at 414 N. Central Park Avenue, located just north of the Garfield Park Conservatory and Green Line station. Developed by the Interfaith Housing Development Corporation of Chicago in partnership with nonprofit Deborah's Place, the West Side project is a contemporary take on a single-room occupancy (SRO) building and will feature 43 studio apartments to provide permanent supportive housing for individuals experiencing homelessness. Twenty-two of the units will go to residents earning 30 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), which works out to roughly $19,600. The remainder of apartments will target residents making up to 50 percent of the AMI or $32,650. HED Architects designed the building to meet Passive House requirements for sustainability, which will help lower operating costs as well as rents. The Conservatory Apartments are expected to cost $12.1 million. In addition to the $3.5 million in requested TIF, the project also secured $6.9 million in funding from the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA). The Chicago Department of Planning and Development signed off on the design and the developer is in the process of bidding the project out. Interfaith Housing Development Corporation has yet to select a general contractor but it is engaging several prospects including MBE and WBE firms, as required by the city. The Community Development Commission voted 8 to 0 to grant the authority to the Department of Housing to negotiate a redevelopment agreement with the Conservatory Apartments team. The commissioners also recommended that the City Council approve the $3.5 million in TIF money for the project. The development will, however, need to close by this December or risk losing half of the $6.9 million in IDHA funding, according to Jim O'Connell from the city's Department of Housing.

Tenants will sign 1-year leases and will pay no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. In cases where at-risk families have no income, the complex is prepared to accept zero rent. The design of the upcoming masonry building comes from Deconstruct Architecture. It includes on-site parking for 14 vehicles and resident amenities such as a lounge, a laundry room, an exercise room, childcare facilities, a community garden, and a playground. According to Breakthrough, the project is being supported by a variety of anonymous donors in these early stages. The building would rise just west of Breakthrough's woman's shelter and food pantry. The nonprofit also operates a men's shelter in the area and the multi-use Breakthrough FamilyPlex, which is located at nearby 3219 W. Carroll.  The Community Development Commission recommended that the city enter a negotiated sale with Breakthrough, which will purchase the property at its market-rate value of $52,000. The Commission also voted to issue a request for alternative proposals as well as recommend that the city approve the sale if no responsive alternatives are received. The measures will next go before the City Council for final approvals.  ",East Garfield Park,0.0
Sustainable 'Garfield Green' apartments move forward,"In Garfield Park, plans are advancing to redevelop 1.5 acres of city-owned land into a mixed-use affordable housing complex that prioritizes energy efficiency and green design.  Nonprofit developer Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH) filed a zoning application for a pair of lots at the intersection of Kedzie and 5th avenues. If approvals go as planned, the two-building development could apply for construction permits as early as August and break ground later this year. Dubbed the Garfield Green, the $25 million project was selected in 2019 as the winning proposal in the C40 Reinventing Cities Initiative, which engaged cities around the world to create sustainable developments in response to climate change. Preservation of Affordable Housing has been working to engage the local community—a step it says was lacking during the initial C40 competition. There are over 600 comments and suggestions from community members regarding what they want to see in the project. Earlier this month, POAH held a virtual meeting with neighbors to present the changes to the Garfield Green that incorporate the community feedback. The revised design—a collaboration between Perkins + Will and NIA Architects—has shifted from a lighter color to a darker facade of ironspot brick and high-density fiber cement panels. The development now calls for 81 affordable apartments offered in one- to three-bedroom floorplans. Fifty of the units will be located in the southern first phase and the remaining 31 in the northern phase two building. An earlier design called for 77 mixed-income units (including 14 market-rate apartments) across the two parcels. The updated plan still features community-focused retail spaces, public plazas, and green features such as solar panels and rooftop community gardens. The transit-oriented project will have a total of 32 parking spaces.  The Garfield Green received funding in March 2020 from the Chicago Department of Housing in the form of low-income housing tax credits. POAH was looking to start a dialog with the local residents then but was delayed by the pandemic. ""We didn't want to start the [community engagement] process until we knew the project would move forward,"" POAH wrote on its website. ""Our community meetings were further delayed due to Covid-19. We are proceeding with online meetings and forums and we thank you for your patience."" Meanwhile, city planners are currently evaluating four proposals in a second Chicago design competition with C40 Reinventing Cities—this time in the Loop. The winning team will redevelop a city-owned parking garage across from the Harold Washington Library and make improvements to adjacent Pritzker Park.    ",East Garfield Park,0.0
Developer cuts ribbon on affordable townhomes in East Garfield Park,"Chicago-based Structured Development has completed the first phase of an affordable for-sale townhouse project dubbed Harrison Row. The seven homes occupy a once-vacant lot at the corner of W. Congress Parkway and S. Francisco Avenue along the southern edge of the East Garfield Park neighborhood. Each new residence spans roughly 1,200 square feet and features three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms. Pricing starts at $229,000 for qualified buyers earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Three of the homes are already under contract, and move-ins are expected to begin in the coming weeks. Structured Development is building the Harrison Row project to fulfill its obligations under the city's Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO), which mandates that projects receiving a zoning change or other assistance from the city provide a percentage of affordable housing either on- or off-site. In Structured's case, the affordability requirements were triggered by the approval for its ""Shops at Big Deahl"" project, a mixed-use high-rise in development at the corner of Dayton and Blackhawk in Lincoln Park. This week's ribbon-cutting ceremony also signaled the launch of Harrison Row's second phase which includes an additional 26 townhomes. For phase two, Structured has engaged in a mentorship program and joint venture with Fain's Development LLC, an up-and-coming minority-owned firm led by Kevin Brinson and Quentin ""Q"" Addison. The local developer will share fee revenues, profit, and losses with Structured and will gain crucial experience to independently pursue future projects.  ""As the industry has widely acknowledged, we need more diversity in real estate, including development,"" said Mike Drew, founding principal of Structured Development, in a statement. ""We’re grateful to Alderman Burnett for making the introduction to Fain’s Development, as we felt it was crucial to partner with a local firm. We look forward to them leveraging the lessons learned through this joint venture to achieve great successes on their own."" Future phases of Harrison Row could total as many as 50 affordable-rate townhomes replacing vacant lots to the immediate south, near the intersection of Harrison and Francisco. The project will create more opportunities for homeownership for low-income and working-class families on the city's West Side.    ",East Garfield Park,0.0
Construction set to begin in March at 5356 N. Sheridan,"Construction is expected to start in March on the residential development at 5356 N. Sheridan. Currently home to the existing Wing Hoe Restaurant building, the project is located on a corner lot at the intersection of N. Sheridan Rd and W. Balmoral Ave. Tempus Real Estate Group is the developer behind the proposal. With a design from 2R/Z Architecture, the new construction will deliver a five-story residential building. Planned with no retail space, the project will hold 50 residential units split between 34 one-beds and 16 two-beds, with 25 car parking spaces and 38 bike parking spaces. Rising 74 feet, the building will be a concrete structure with fiber cement panels in varying colors and size generating a patterned facade matched with metal and aluminum panels. The design creates a unique, modern apartment living option that provides a continuous frontage along both of the streets. The ground floor facade activates the pedestrian experience with increased vegetation and continuity along the sidewalk. Lofted residential units will face W. Balmoral Ave, with the residential entry facing N. Sheridan Rd. The L-shape volume is oriented to maintain the street walls, with balconies inset into the facade.  The development will include 5 affordable units on-site, with a makeup of 3 one-beds and 2 two-beds, all targeted for those making up to 60% AMI.  According to 48th Ward Alderwoman Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth’s newsletter, permits for demolition have been submitted and approved for January 2024, and the subsequent construction on the building is set to commence in March 2024 with general contractor DOM Properties Investment.  ",Edgewater,1.0

Epworth Church is officially a landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation for the Epworth Church building. Located at 5253 N. Kenmore, the church building has been formerly known as Epworth Methodist Episcopal Church and Epworth United Methodist Church. Constructed in 1891 by architect Frederick B. Townsend, the preliminary designation also includes the community house addition from 1931 from architects Thielbar and Fugard. The congregation no longer worships inside the church and the property is currently being marketed for sale. Meeting Criterion 1 for heritage, the Epworth Church building is a part of Edgewater’s history as it stood as a suburban scale church that was at home in the leafy retreat for Victorian-era Chicagoans that Edgewater was at the time. The land for the church was granted by John Cochran, the developer of Edgewater, and the design was donated by architect Frederick B. Townsend.  The church is also in compliance with Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Built as a very rare example of fieldstone architecture, the building is made up of large, uncoursed granite boulders that were shipped in from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The granite is left in its natural shape and exhibits a wide variety of color. The community house addition, built in 1931 for the church’s growing needs, combines granite fieldstone with cast stone walls that use concrete formwork to mimic carved stone. This was a new construction and material method at the time. The church building also meets Criterion 5 for being the work of a significant architect, in this case Fredrick B. Townsend, who has an extensive portfolio across the city including the Five Houses on Avers which is a landmark district. Criterion 7 is also met due to the unique and distinctive visual features that the church possesses in its exterior construction. Although the context surrounding the church has changed, the building itself has excellent physical integrity, meeting the integrity criterion. The only major changes include the community house addition and the narthex added to the front of the church at the same time as the addition.  Significant features of the building to be protected are all exterior elevations including rooflines of both the original church and the community house. With a developer planning to convert the church and community house into affordable apartments, landmarks staff have included flexibility into the designation that will allow for the alteration of the windows to meet light and ventilation requirements for dwelling units. With the landmark designation approved by the City Council, the building is fully protected from demolition. ",Edgewater,0.0

Affordable apartments planned at 5853 N. Broadway,"An all-affordable residential building has been proposed at 5853 N. Broadway. Set to replace a Streets and Sanitation depot, the new building will rise along Broadway just south of W. Thorndale Ave and Broadway Armory Park. Bickerdike Redevelopment Corporation is the developer behind the proposal. With Landon Bone Baker Architects in charge of the architecture, the new building will rise 11 floors with 90 units inside. With all units earmarked for those making up to 60% AMI, the unit mix will include 35 one-beds, 40 two-beds, and 15 three-beds. The three-bedroom units will have two bathrooms, while the rest will have one bathroom.  Located near the Thorndale Red Line station, the building will include just 19 car parking spaces, while providing 90 spaces for bikes. Tenant amenities will include a third-floor terrace, on-site management offices, and ground-floor meeting rooms. The roof will be topped with solar panels and a terrace.  First announced via Block Club Chicago in late 2021, the building design has undergone some changes, cutting its height from 12 to 11 floors and trimming the units from 94 to 90. With city input, the design was changed to reduce the street frontage from four to three floors and to break up the facade with different types of cladding to reduce the scale. The overall tower is pushed back from the street and has also been redesigned with different facade portions.  According to Bickerdike, they plan to fund the project with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), either from the City of Chicago or the Illinois Housing Development Authority, as well as through other sources including potential TIF or HOME funds. They plan to submit to the Chicago Department of Housing for funding by Summer 2023 and begin the zoning process in Fall 2023.

Edgewater apartment proposal moves forward with revised design,"The long-discussed redevelopment of Edgewater's former Wing Hoe restaurant site at 5356 N. Sheridan Road is preparing to move forward with a revised design and a new developer at the helm.  In 2018, MCZ Development first presented plans calling for a four-story, 50-unit rental complex at the southwest corner of Sheridan and Balmoral. Although MCZ's project passed the city's Committee on Zoning in late 2019, the Zoning Board of Appeals denied a rear yard setback variance, and the project never got off the ground, according to Dan Luna, chief of staff for Ald. Harry Osterman (48th). The latest plan comes from Tempus Real Estate Group and 2R/Z Architecture. While the revised proposal still includes 50 apartments, the building now stands five stories—topping out at roughly 74 feet. The transit-oriented development will provide on-site parking for 25 cars and no commercial space. The project falls under the city's previous affordable housing rules, and five below-market-rate units will be provided on-site, Luna told Urbanize.  The new apartment complex would replace the historic 108-year-old mansion that housed Wing Hoe restaurant since 1971. The Szechwan and Mandarin eatery closed its doors for good at the end of 2020, Block Club Chicago reported at the time. Wing Hoe's owners retired after the closure and did not seek a new location for the restaurant. Representatives from the development team will host a public open house at 5356 N. Sheridan on Sunday, August 14, between 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Members of the surrounding community will have an opportunity to review the latest plans and share any questions or concerns they may have with the developers.

Transit-oriented apartments proposed for used car lot on Broadway,"In Edgewater, J & P Contractors plans to redevelop a used car lot at 5828 N. Broadway into a five-story, 20-unit transit-oriented development (TOD). The developer-builder shared the proposal at an August 3 community meeting organized by the office of 48th Ward Ald. Harry Osterman. The proposed 24,600-square-foot building would rise approximately 57 feet and replace the car lot as well as a shed and small single-story office structure. The ground-floor plan includes parking for 11 cars (seven inside the structure and four outside), storage for 12 bicycles, and no retail. The roof will be home to a communal deck for residents.  The four residential floors will contain five units each: two 2-bedroom apartments with recessed balconies facing Broadway and three 1-bedroom apartments with individual hanging balconies at the rear of the building. Monthly rents will start at $1,200 for 1-bedrooms and $2,000 for 2-bedrooms, according to developer Joe Lyons. Designed by SGW Architecture & Design, the proposal sports a brick facade on all sides, exterior planters facing Broadway, and stone accents inspired by traditional Chicago buildings. Since the city's building code does not allow windows at the lot line (for fire safety reasons), the sides of 5828 N. Broadway will use two different colors of brick to create a grid pattern that mimics windows, according to its architects.  The development will require a zoning change from B1-2 to B2-3 TOD. The project aims to qualify for reduced on-site parking under Chicago's Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Ordinance due to its proximity to the Thorndale CTA Red Line station. Four units will be set aside as affordable housing to comply with Chicago's Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO), which recently boosted the required units from 10 to 20 percent. If approvals go forward as planned, the developers hope to break ground on the project at 5828 N. Broadway in mid-2022 and complete the apartments in the first half of 2023. ",Edgewater,0.0
CTA readies massive Red Line overhaul in Uptown and Edgewater,"Chicago transit riders and north side residents are about to feel the impact of the Red and Purple Modernization (RPM) Project, which is about to commence major construction work in Edgewater and Uptown, the CTA announced on Tuesday. On May 16, crews will begin a more than three-year-long process to rebuild 100-year-old track structures and replace four of the Red Line's oldest stops with ADA-compliant stations featuring elevators, escalators, wider platforms, and other improvements. The Lawrence to Bryn Mawr Modernization Project will be divided into two phases. Phase A, which starts next month and is expected to wrap up in 2022, will close and demolish the Red Line stations at Lawrence, Argyle, Berwyn, and Bryn Mawr.  The CTA will operate temporary stations at Argyle and Bryn Mawr, but the Lawrence and Berwyn stops will remain closed for more than three years. During this time, crews from CTA contractor Walsh-Fluor will demolish and rebuild the eastern set of tracks. Using overhead cranes, crews will install prefabricated track support segments that are built off-site. According to the CTA, more than 1,500 of these segments—weighing a combined 66,865 tons—will be used between Lawrence and Bryn Mawr. Phase B of the project is slated for late 2022 to 2024 and includes rebuilding the western portion of tracks as well as constructing the four new permanent stations at Lawrence, Argyle, Berwyn, and Bryn Mawr. Red and Purple Line service will continue throughout construction, but with trains running on two tracks instead of the usual four. Transit riders ""should allow extra travel time,"" the CTA advised on Tuesday. The $2.1 billion RPM project is the most expensive capital improvement project in the history of the Chicago Transit Authority. It also includes the Belmont Flyover, which will eliminate a congested bottleneck where the Purple, Brown, and Red lines intersect. The flyover is already under construction in Lakeview and is expected to be completed later this year. Other components of the RPM project include a new signal system between Howard and Belmont. The CTA will also replace Red and Purple Line track structures between Belmont and Newport/Cornelia and expects to complete that work by the end of 2024. Financing for the project relies on $1.1 billion in federal money and transit-specific tax increment financing (TIF) districts. Future phases of the RPM project have not yet been announced and are currently awaiting funding, according to the CTA.   ",Edgewater,0.0
CDC approves TIF for affordable adaptive reuse at 6121 S. Hermitage,"The Community Development Commission has approved a redevelopment agreement for the affordable adaptive reuse development at 6121 S. Hermitage, which will include a TIF grant of $4.2 million. Located at the southeast corner of S. Hermitage Ave and W. 61st St, the project site contains the former Charles Warrington Earle School and its surrounding parking lots and green space. Planned by Gorman & Company, the first phase of the development will adaptively reuse the school building, converting it into 50 units of affordable housing with 50 parking spaces. The 100% affordable development will have 4 one-beds at 50% AMI, 19 one-beds at 30% AMI, 2 two-beds at 50% AMI, 1 two-bed at 30% AMI, 4 two-beds at 15% AMI, 7 one-beds at 60% AMI, and 13 two-beds at 60% AMI. Designed by local firm Beehyyve, the 1974 portion of the building will be demolished, with the rest of the school rehabbed. The historic school building will have its exterior cleaned and new windows will be installed to enclose the facade.  On the inside, the amenity suite will include a sports court in the old gym space, a mail and package room, a computer lab, management offices and services offices, a community/activity room, a fitness room, a laundry room, and bike storage. Exterior amenities will include green space and a new playground. On the south side of the site, future development is in the works but not fully designed. Current outlines would call for five townhome buildings that deliver 25 units.  With an approximately $31 million project budget, the development will be funded with a $1.8 million mortgage, $4.2 million in TIF, $1 million in FHLB AHP, a $225,000 ComEd grant, $3 million in IHDA soft funds, a $400,000 deferred developer fee, $13.6 million in LIHTC tax credits, and $6.8 million in historic tax credits. The developers need to close on the financing by the end of the year to get LIHTC funding, in addition to state and federal historic tax credits. With full approval secured from City Council, the team will turn towards finalizing the financing package for the project before beginning construction. ",Englewood,1.0

Englewood Nature Trail gets $20 million in funding,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot, U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and U.S. Congressman Danny Davis (D-IL-07) recently announced $20M in federal grant funding awarded to support the Englewood Nature Trail.  Poised to convert a 1.75-mile abandoned railway corridor into a grade-separated multi use path for walking and biking, the trail will not only revitalize a railway corridor that has been unused since the 1960s, but also serve as the spine of an urban agriculture district that occupies adjacent land, along with other productive uses. The long-term goals for the trail include connecting the surrounding area with safe and inviting park space and multi-use paths. “This equity-focused investment in the Englewood community will serve as a major catalyst for revitalization,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “The Englewood Nature Trail is both a physical connector and pathway to community connectivity and opportunity. The trail, which was importantly developed as part of a community-led process, will benefit Englewood residents for years to come.” The funding was awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) discretionary grant program to help communities carry out infrastructure and transportation projects with significant local or regional impact. The money will go towards the detailed design and construction of the trail, which is planned to run east to west along an elevated berm, starting near Hoyne Ave to the west and crossing over 26 viaducts on its way east towards Wallace St. There will be nine access points to the trail for the communities that it will pass through. As part of the citywide vision of trails and open spaces, the city is seeking both federal and local funding sources to support the completion of the Englewood Nature Trail project and will be working with community stakeholders in tandem with city departments including CDOT, DPD, and Chicago Park District.

""As a minority developer, we are very interested in seeing how we can help communities where the people who live there look like us,"" said Tisha Germany, a vice president of Keith B. Key Enterprises, at Tuesday's meeting of the  Community Development Commission (CDC). ""This is a community and a city that we've been very interested in for probably 15 to 18 years now, so we're extremely excited for this to be our first project in Chicago.""  The Community Development Commission voted in favor of advertising the Department of Housing’s intention to enter into a negotiated sale with the developer. Once the 30-day public notice period has been served and if no alternative proposals are received, officials hope to introduce a measure to sell the property in July, pass City Council in September, and close on the transaction by the end of the year. Nine units in the new building will be reserved for residents earning 30 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), five units will go to residents making 50 percent AMI, and 26 units will be offered to Chicagoans with incomes at 60 percent AMI. The remaining 16 apartments will be rented at market rate. The project intends to use Low-Income Housing Tax Credits plus CHA vouchers for the units priced at 30 percent AMI.  The design of the proposed building comes from Cleveland-based RDL Architects, which is partnering with Chicago's Johnson & Lee Architects on the South Side project. A ""second phase"" mixed-use building is slated for the northern portion of the development site and will be reviewed at a later time.  ",Englewood,0.0
Vacant Englewood lot envisioned as vibrant 'eco-food hub',"In Englewood, a swath of vacant land along the 800 block of West 63rd will give way to an eco-food hub, business incubator, and flexible community space, city officials announced last week.  The $10.3 million project is led by a joint venture consisting of McLaurin Development Partners and Farpoint Development. The group was selected by the city’s INVEST South/West initiative to bring community-focused developments to neighborhoods that have historically suffered from disinvestment. Architecture firms TnS Studio and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill are collaborating on the design of the project, which is dubbed Englewood Connect. It is envisioned as the next phase of the Englewood Square shopping development, which is anchored by a Whole Foods that opened in 2016. Renderings show a new pavilion dubbed the “Englewood Living Room.” The space features movable walls that can create an open-air venue in warmer months and could contain hanging planters, a cafe, and a performance area. Nearby vacant land will be used for community farming. There’s also an adaptive reuse element of the plan, which would restore the nearby vacant firehouse on Green Street. The building, designed with Tudor revival architecturual details, was completed in 1929 and declared a protected City of Chicago landmark in 2003. The team sees the older structure serving as a multi-purpose venue. “We envision a dynamic mix of community spaces, accessible to all local residents and connected to the surrounding neighborhoods,” said Dawveed Scully, urban planning associate director at SOM, in a statement. “With flexible spaces that can be used year-round, our plan creates an ecosystem that cultivates upward mobility anchored by entrepreneurialism.”  City officials issued a request for proposals for the Englewood parcel back in August. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development also announced winning bids to redevelop a vacant lot in Auburn Gresham into 56 units of affordable housing as well as a mixed-use restoration and expansion of Austin’s Art Deco Laramie Bank building.

Evanston commission approves 116-unit apartment complex,"A five-story transit-oriented apartment project from MCZ Development won zoning approval from the Evanston's Plan Commission. The proposal would replace the Autobarn Nissan car dealership at 1012 Chicago Avenue, a short walk from the Metra and the CTA Purple Line. Designed by Chicago-based 2R/Z Architecture, the 80-foot-tall structure will contain 116 apartments. The unit mix features 16 studios, 80 one-bedrooms, 12 two-bedrooms, and 8 live-work units ranging from 500 to 1,100 square feet in size. Ten of the apartments at 1012 Chicago Avenue will be set aside as on-site inclusionary housing per Evanston's Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.  The mixed-use complex also contains 5,800 square feet of ground-floor retail space, a west-facing second-floor terrace, rooftop amenities, a dog run, storage for 76 bicycles, and below-ground parking for 58 vehicles. The garage and loading will be accessed on the site's north side via a single curb fronting Chicago Avenue (which replaces the dealership's two existing curb cuts). The Evanston Design and Project Review Committee reviewed and approved the proposed Planned Development on July 7. The Plan Commission also voted in favor of MCZ's project but recommended that the building's balconies should not extend over the public way and that non-residential loading should not take place during rush and late evening hours, Evanston Now reported. The proposal will next go before the Evanston City Council’s Planning and Development Committee for further review.  ",Evanston,0.0

1353 W. Fulton gets foundation permit,"A foundation permit has been issued for a mixed-use development 1353 W. Fulton. Planned by Shapack Partners, the development, also known under the address of 220 N. Ada, is located at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Ada St. A demolition permit was issued back in May to clear the site of the existing one-story masonry building on the property.  Rising 314 feet, the project will consist of a 29-story, mixed-use tower with 308 residential units, ground floor retail space, 115 parking spaces, and 58 bike parking spaces. The unit mix will consist of studios, one-beds, and two-beds. With a design from SOM, the building will consist of a three-story podium with a square tower portion rising above oriented along N. Ada St setback from W. Fulton St. The residential entry will front N. Ada St while retail space will span from the residential entry up to W. Fulton St. Amenity space will top the podium and occupy the top floor of the tower. Balconies will dot the facade in a seemingly random pattern that aligns with unit types. The podium will be expressed as two separate massings. The portion under the tower is expressed with a similar materiality and gridding as the tower above. To the north of the tower, the podium at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Ada St is expressed as a solid volume with brick detailing that creates porosity and creates a play of light and shadow as the sun moves.  The project will meet sustainability goals by achieving a Green Globes 2-Globes certification, installing two EV charging stations, preparing 23 parking spots for EV charging readiness, installing a CTA digital display, and ensuring 80% construction waste diversion.  To meet affordability requirements, the developers will provide 20% of the units as affordable housing on-site at a weighted average of 60% AMI. With the foundation permit in hand, general contractor Clayco Inc can begin construction on the building’s caissons. A full building permit has yet to be filed for the $135 million tower.

919 W. Fulton celebrates groundbreaking,"Developers Fulton Street Companies and JDL Development yesterday celebrated the groundbreaking of 919 W. Fulton. Situated in Fulton Market, the project marks Chicago’s first major new office development to commence construction in over a year. “Today’s groundbreaking event is a win for Chicago,” said Alex Najem, Founder and CEO of Fulton Street Companies. “We have assembled the very best organizations and companies, led by exceptional people, to remind the world that we can – and will – continue to build in downtown Chicago. Shanna Khan is the definition of exceptional people, and 919 W Fulton would not be possible if not for her belief in the project, her vision as the chief design officer and commitment as the lead equity investor with SNK Capital. As such, Fulton Street is grateful for Shanna, the leadership of Alderman and Vice Mayor Burnett, our tenants and all of our partners for making this ambitious and remarkable development a reality for our great city.” The 400,000 square foot mixed-use building is set to become home to the headquarters of Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, who will occupy 112,000 square feet of space in the 11-story building. On the ground floor, Gibsons Restaurant Group will occupy 15,500 square feet of the planned retail space. 65 car parking spaces will be included in an underground parking level. Designed by Morris Adjmi Architects and FitzGerald, the 11-story building features a facade that was designed to fit into the historic context and exhibits a series of notches and setbacks as it rises to reduce its visual impact on the historic Fulton-Randolph Market District that it will sit within. Originally planned to connect to the residential building at 910 W. Lake and convert it into more office space, the revised scope of the project will leave the existing building as apartments due to the stronger demand for residential.  The project pays great attention to air quality, material selection, energy efficiency, wellness and environmental impact, and is pursuing WELL and LEED Silver certifications. With two lobbies—one on Sangamon and one corridor connecting access between Fulton and Lake streets—the address of the finished building will be 217 N Sangamon. Financial backing for the project was secured through strategic partnerships with Bank OZK and Manulife Investment Management. SNK Capital assumed the pivotal role as the lead equity investment partner. With Skender serving as general contractor, the construction is expected to be completed in 2025. ",Fulton Market,0.0

Urbanize tours penthouses at The Row Fulton Market,"Urbanize returned to The Row Fulton Market to see the upper residences and penthouses at the top of the building. Overlooking Fulton Market and the surrounding city, the building at 164 N. Peoria was developed by Related Midwest with the design coming from Morris Adjmi Architects.  Starting on the 33rd floor, the Tier 3 model unit was a 3-bedroom, 2.5-bath layout measuring 1,650 square feet. Priced at a range of $6,495-$7,465 per month, the particular layout we viewed featured a southeastern view from the large living space and kitchen. One of the bedrooms was staged to show how residents could use it as a private home office in an era of working from home. Heading up to the 42nd floor, the first penthouse we toured measured almost 2,400 square feet with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths. The large living space and kitchen faces northeast, giving sweeping views of downtown and the lakefront going north, while the east-facing primary suite also features expansive views of downtown. 12-foot ceilings, motorized window shades, and heated floors in the primary suite bathroom are just a few of the luxury features in the penthouse that is listed for $15,250 per month. Our final stop was a 43rd floor penthouse featuring a northwest exposure in the main living space with bedrooms facing west. With 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, the almost 2,400 square foot layout would rent for $16,250 per month. While sharing many of the luxury features of the other penthouse, this configuration includes a 430-square-foot outdoor terrace that wraps around the northwest corner to give views west and north from the building. In our previous tour at the end of June, we saw the building’s amenity spaces which are on the sixth floor. Residents will have access to the Gather Room and connecting Study, which offer a range of seating configurations and workspace options ranging from booths to library tables to private conference rooms oriented around a three-sided fireplace; the Athletic Club, a fully equipped fitness center with adjacent Wellness Studio and two separate terraces for open-air workouts; the Playhouse, a colorful, interactive play area for children outfitted with toys, games and spaces for playdates and parties; and the Social Club, a reservable entertainment suite with adjacent terrace.  Outside, the 13,800-square-foot landscaped deck wraps the tower on three sides, featuring the west-facing lap pool with lounge seating; the three outdoor grilling kitchens tucked under pergolas and separated by high planters; the lounging hammocks; and the two fire pits overlooking the surrounding cityscape. With the first move-ins starting back in early June, the building is already 85% leased, with all of the affordable units rented.

On the ground floor, Gibsons Restaurant Group will occupy 15,500 square feet of the planned retail space. Designed by Morris Adjmi Architects and FitzGerald, the 11-story building was originally planned to connect to the residential building at 910 W. Lake and convert it into more office space. The revised scope of the project will leave the existing building as apartments due to the stronger demand for apartments.  According to a report from CoStar, the debt is a combined $233 million from Bank OZK and Manulife Investment Management. The developers have cited a 2025 target for completion of the building, with Skender serving as the general contractor.  ",Fulton Market,0.0
Guinness Open Gate Brewery celebrates ribbon cutting,"Guinness recently celebrated the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Guinness Open Gate Brewery in Fulton Market. Located at 901 W. Kinzie, the former rail depot consists of a brewery, taproom, restaurant, and bakery housed in a 15,000-square-foot newly transformed space. This site will combine more than 260 years of brewing experience from Ireland, with cutting edge American brewing innovation, for a uniquely Chicago experience.  “This is an exciting step in the continuing evolution of the Guinness brand in America. It’s been a long journey, but we are so thrilled to be opening our doors this week and to contribute to Chicago’s world class food and beer scene,” said Rodney Williams, President of Diageo Beer Company. “As a Chicago native, I can confidently share that we aim to celebrate and showcase this great city and make a positive impact in the community, all while serving great beer.” Designed by Whitney Architects and Studio K Creative, the design of the building marries new and old, transforming a long vacant building into a state of-the-art facility, with a front patio with stairs reminiscent of Chicago’s Riverwalk steps, and a contemporary door with weathered steel finish. The space features a hand painted mural, complemented by a bubbly amber sculptural light fixture – a nod to the iconic foam atop a fresh pint of Guinness – which flows throughout the brewery. A nearly 10,000-pound harp sculpture with layered ambient lighting sits high above the main taproom bar.  Guests can expect 12-16 rotating experimental draughts, most of which will be brewed on site and exclusively available in the taproom, alongside signatures like Guinness Draught Stout, Guinness Extra Stout, and Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, which will always come straight from Dublin. Led by Brewer Megan Schwarz, the Chicago brewing team’s 10-barrel brewhouse is hard at work with an initial line-up including Corn Maize Cream Ale made from corn grown in Illinois’ Iroquois County, Kinzie Street Pale Ale, and a Mango Chile Ale. Guinness 0 Nonalcoholic Draught will also be available.  The culinary program will be led by Dream Team Hospitality, a joint venture by local industry veterans, with chef Taylor Bischof at the helm. The food menu draws inspiration from the brand’s Irish roots and global footprint, alongside reimagined Chicago classics. The site will offer morning bakery and café service daily, with an all-day restaurant menu available Wednesday through Sunday, as well as brunch on weekends.  Clune Construction served as the general contractor for the build-out.

Urbanize tours Cassidy on Canal,"Urbanize recently visited the construction site of Cassidy on Canal, a mixed-use development at 350 N. Canal. Located on the west side of N. Canal St, between W. Kinzie St and W. Fulton St, the site was formerly home to the Cassidy Tire building. Developed by The Habitat Company and Diversified Real Estate Capital LLC, the new 33-story tower was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz to stand 356 feet tall with 343 rental apartments inside. Led by McHugh Construction, we began the tour by taking the skip up to the roof. With a pretty clear day, there were expansive views of the West Loop to the west and River North to the northeast and beyond. The roof will not be accessible to residents and is home to large mechanical units for the building. Heading down into the tower, the 33rd floor is the highest occupiable floor in the building. This floor and the two below will hold the building’s penthouse units. The tower’s glazing has been fully installed all the way up to these highest floors and crews are working on the mechanical rough ins on these floors. Working our way down the building, our next stop was the 25th floor. Here crews were framing in the units, which was the first time where you could start to see the different units taking shape and splitting up the overall floor plate.  Stopping next on the 19th floor, here crews have gotten drywall installed, but not mudded and taped. The addition of drywall helps define rooms and units more clearly without finishes installed yet. Our next stop was the sixth floor, where flooring and cabinetry have been installed. These units begin to look more finished and can give a good impression of what finished units will eventually look like when all the final touches are completed. Heading down one more level, the fifth floor will be fully amenity space, with outdoor decks on top of the parking podium. The south deck has an outdoor pool as well as grilling stations and spaces for cabana framed by planters. The amenity deck will wrap around the west side of the building towards another outdoor deck on the north side which will hold more grilling stations and seating opportunities with planters. Inside, there will be coworking spaces, a fitness center, and resident lounge. Our final stop was the building’s lobby, which is still a raw space that is being framed in. A motor court outside will offer space for pickups and drop-offs within the site boundary off of the street.  With the building topped off and enclosed since our last visit, general contractor McHugh Construction is making rapid progress on the building. The first occupancy of the lower 20 floors is expected in Spring 2024 with full turnover planned in Summer 2024. ",Fulton River District,0.0
Developer looks to sell development site at 527 W. Kinzie,"Vornado Realty Trust is looking to sell their development site at 527 W. Kinzie. Located near the Chicago River in the Fulton River District, the piece of land sits at the southwest corner of W. Kinzie St and N. Canal St. The developer had been planning a 26-story residential tower designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners. The 290 foot-tall structure would have contained 288 residential units, while providing 81 car parking spaces. The unit mix would have had 35 studios, 35 convertibles, 108 1-beds, 38 2-beds, and 12 3-bedroom configurations.  With CBRE brokers hired to lead the sale of the surface parking lot, the move comes as developer The Habitat Company wraps up construction on their development at 350 N. Canal next door to the south which will provide 343 units in a 33-story building.  Vornado has owned the site since 1998 and the site’s most recent progress was in January 2022 when the 26-story residential tower scheme was announced via Alderman Reilly’s newsletter to constituents.  According to reports from CoStar, it's unclear why Vornado has decided to offload the site instead of moving ahead and a sale price has not been listed.  ",Fulton River District,0.0
Urbanize tours Cassidy on Canal,"Urbanize recently toured the construction site for Cassidy on Canal, a mixed-use development at 350 N. Canal. Located on the west side of N. Canal St, between W. Kinzie St and W. Fulton St, the site was formerly home to the Cassidy Tire building. Developed by The Habitat Company and Diversified Real Estate Capital LLC, the new 33-story tower was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz to stand 356 feet tall and hold 343 apartments. Led by McHugh Construction and The Habitat Company, our tour began by taking the skip to the 14th floor. With McHugh Concrete on the job, crews had just poured the 19th floor and were setting the formwork for the 20th level. On the 14th floor, mechanicals installation has begun, and pole shores are out of the space. As a typical residential floor, it will have 13 units and the concrete ceilings will get a skim coat finish. Heading down the building, our next stop was the 8th floor. On this floor, workers had begun the installation of the sills for the window wall system. Crews have also outlined where the wall framing will go with chalk on the floors. The next stop on the walkthrough was the 5th floor. Planned to be an amenity floor, glass installation has begun on this level. The east and north facades have the glass installed while the west and south-facing walls have yet to receive glass. The interior amenity offerings will include a steam room and sauna, club room with lounge and kitchen, coworking spaces, a game room, restrooms and shower for the pool and sauna, and a fitness center on the east side that overlooks the street. The north-facing roof deck is currently being used to tie the rebar cages for the tower’s columns but will eventually be home to fire pits and grill stations. The south-facing deck will be home to the outdoor pool and is currently being used for staging and storage of supplies.  The last stop of the tour was down back at the ground floor. Approximately 1,300 square feet of retail space will front N. Canal St, while the residential lobby will face north to a drop-off loop that comes off the street. The tower crane is currently placed in a spot that will get a fountain when the project is completed. With McHugh Concrete and McHugh Construction working on the building, the concrete structure should top out mid-summer, with the glass enclosure wrapping up by the end of the year. The first occupancy of the lower 20 floors is set for February 2024 with substantial completion scheduled for the end of Summer 2024. ",Fulton River District,0.0
ZBA approves variances for 629 W. Lake,"The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a set of variances for a mixed-use development at 629 W. Lake St. Currently home to the Fast Track restaurant, the subject property is a slender lot at the southeastern corner of the intersection of W. Lake St and N. Desplaines St. Developed by Rogers Park Holdings LLC, Urbanize originally reported on the project back in February.  With a design from Axios Architects and Consultants, the new development will deliver an eight-story mixed-use building. Rising 123 feet, the building will hold 2,000 square feet of retail space and 49 residential units. The unit mix will consist of 19 studios, 17 one-beds, and 13 two-bedroom apartments. 49 bike parking spaces and 2 car parking spaces will be provided. Occupying the site lot line-to-lot line, the retail space will occupy the northern corner, facing both W. Lake St and N Desplaines St. The residential entry will front N. Desplaines St at about the center of the building. The building’s edifice will be made up of brick with a stone cornice. Metal and glass balconies will dot the facade, providing outdoor space for every unit. The developer sought approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals to reduce the required parking spaces from 34 to 2, as well as to reduce the rear setback on floors with dwelling units from the required 30 feet down to 0.12 feet. With ZBA approval, the as-of right development can move forward without any further city approvals. Permits have not been filed for the project. ",Fulton River District,0.0
Cassidy on Canal breaks ground at 350 N. Canal,"Urbanize recently attended the groundbreaking ceremony for Cassidy on Canal. Located at 350 N. Canal, the development is being planned by Chicago-based The Habitat Company in collaboration with joint venture partner Diversified Real Estate Capital LLC.   “It is always with great anticipation that I look forward to this day when the shovels go into the ground and construction commences on a pioneering new development like Cassidy on Canal,” said Habitat Founder and Chairman Daniel Levin. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the new 33-story mixed-use tower will offer 343 new luxury apartments in addition to 1,313 square feet of retail space. Broken down into a mix of studio, one-bed, and two-bed units, renters will have access to a full package of amenities on the building’s fifth floor. Amenity spaces will include a fitness center, game room, club rooms, coworking center, spa with sauna, steam and whirlpool rooms, swimming pool with cabanas, a north and south sun deck, grilling area, fire pits, cool weather heaters, and dining areas on each deck surrounded by lush landscaping.  “To honor the location’s rich history, it was important to us to bring this neighborhood a new development that stands out through its forward-looking design and modern conveniences, yet also pays homage to the site’s legacy by keeping the Cassidy family name,” said Habitat President Matt Fiascone.  Located on the west side of Canal Street, between Kinzie and Fulton streets, the 350 N. Canal site was formerly home to the Cassidy Tire building. Habitat plans to integrate some of the property’s original bricks into the build out of the new community. The site’s location should also appeal to a wide range of renters, given its proximity to several L, bus and Metra lines, plus its high walkability to the numerous business, restaurants and entertainment options of the Loop, Fulton Market and River North. “We’re dedicated to investing in vibrant urban locations nationally and partnering with the best local developers like The Habitat Company who have the vision and wealth of experience to bring neighborhood-changing projects to reality,” said Jeff Cherner, executive vice president, Diversified Real Estate Capital, LLC.  With McHugh Construction serving as the general contractor, caisson work was actively underway during the ceremony, creating a very active site during the festivities. With caisson work wrapping up and all permits issued, work will continue through completion. The first resident move-ins are anticipated for spring of 2024.   ",Fulton River District,0.0

Residential tower planned for 527 W. Kinzie,"New York-based developer Vornado Realty Trust is planning a new residential tower at 527 W. Kinzie St in Fulton River District. Located at the southwest corner of W. Kinzie St and N. Canal St, the project would replace an existing surface parking lot. News of the project was broken in Alderman Reilly’s most recent newsletter to constituents. With a design from Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the new tower will rise 26 stories high. Entirely residential, the 290-foot-tall structure will contain 288 residential units, while providing 81 car parking spaces. The unit mix will consist of 35 studios, 35 convertibles, 108 1-beds, 38 2-beds, and 12 3-bedroom configurations. Residents will enter the building through the residential lobby at the corner underneath the curved facade of the main tower volume.  Vehicular access will be solely off of N.

The porte cochere will allow for drop-offs, pick-ups, and deliveries to occur entirely off of the street. Loading is accommodated within the building. The subject parcel addressed at 527 W. Kinzie St is within Subarea D of the existing PD 87. Currently, the planned development statements for Subarea D allow for a residential building measuring up to 340 feet tall with 288 units and 288 parking spaces.

Fulton River District tower begins skyward climb,"Three months have passed since Vancouver-based developer Onni Group broke ground on a rental high-rise at 354 N. Union Avenue in Chicago's Fulton River District. This week the 33-story project is ready to go vertical. Crews recently framed the base of the concrete structure's core and installed the stub for the soon-to-arrive tower crane. The downtown project also recently received a full building permit (it got its foundation permit back in March 2020). The latest permit estimates the scope of the work at $99.6 million and lists Onni Contracting as the general contractor.  Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the tower at 354 N. Union replaces a longtime vacant lot between two rail right-of-ways. The completed building will deliver 373 luxury rentals offered in studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom layouts ranging in size from 400 to 1,600 square feet. The project also includes a 143-car parking podium, a pool deck for residents, and a dog park that will be open to the public during the day.  Onni Group is also behind the three-tower Old Town Park rental development as well as the recently completed apartment tower at 369 W. Grand. The developer is currently seeking city approval for its largest Chicago project yet: a five-tower, 2,650-unit development on the southern tip of Goose Island known as Halsted Point.   ",Fulton River District,0.0
Developer envisions 'habitable billboard' and park atop the Kennedy Expressway,"A Chicago developer has set its sights on transforming a parking lot on top of the Kennedy Expressway into a one-of-a-kind ""experiential"" retail space and a park-like pedestrian connection between the Fulton Market and Fulton River districts. R2 Companies is hoping to attract a well-known brand or benefactor to create what it calls a ""habitable billboard."" The plan calls for a low-density building of up to 12,500 square feet and conceals on-site parking beneath a green roof that will step up and connect to the Halsted Street viaduct. Matt Garrison of R2, which purchased the lot at 708 W. Wayman Street in 2016, says he believes such a project will create a unique win-win situation for both the city and whatever company decides to set up shop at the site.  A brand or retailer will benefit from the location's high visibility along I-94, which boasts traffic counts of over 100 million cars per year, according to a marketing flyer for the property. ""It's like the old Lasalle Bank or Wintrust mural building, but better,"" Garrison said. ""It's more visible, surrounded by a park, and your brand can live in it."" For the city and local residents, there's a chance to create publicly accessible open space in an area of the city where land costs make new parkland prohibitive. ""Rather than build another giant apartment or office tower, we can create a public greenway that connects the entrance to Fulton Market across the highway,"" said Garrison. Renderings of R2's vision show a glassy cube-shaped building hovering on stilt-like legs. Created in collaboration with global architecture firm Gensler, these images are still conceptual and R2 plans to release several other ""low density"" concepts in the near future, Garrison said. R2's proposal is visually reminiscent of a long-discussed idea to cap the Kennedy Expressway with new park space. Although the concept was first explored in a 2003 draft of the city’s Central Area Plan, the Kennedy cap has yet to move forward in a meaningful way. ""Capping the Kennedy is a noble pursuit and we hope it happens someday,"" Garrison told Urbanize. ""Here, the Kennedy is already capped, and R2 owns it. This is an opportunity to make something happen. If we think outside the box, we can privately fund a major public benefit here."" The flyer for 708 W. Wayman suggests the unusual development could be delivered in 2023. For that to happen, however, Garrison says community stakeholders and government officials will need to get on board. ""The project will require buy-in from neighbors, the city, CDOT, and IDOT,"" said Garrison. ""The only way that happens is if we can provide a tangible public benefit, which we will do.""   ",Fulton River District,0.0
33-story apartment tower breaks ground in Fulton River District ,"As Onni Group wraps up construction on one downtown apartment tower, the Vancouver-based developer is starting work on another rental high-rise at 354 N. Union Avenue. Crews and foundation equipment are on-site and already preparing the vacant Fulton River District lot for an upcoming 33-story building with 373 luxury apartments and 143 parking spaces. Designed by Chicago architecture firm Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the project at 354 N.

CHA presents updated design for LeClaire Courts Site A,"The Chicago Housing Authority in partnership with The Habitat Company recently presented the updated design for LeClaire Courts Site A to the Chicago Plan Commission. With the Planned development originally approved back in 2021, this courtesy presentation is part of the mandatory review process for the site plan approval of this first residential phase. As approved, the overall LeClaire Courts master plan allows for a maximum of 725 dwelling units, multiple mixed-use buildings, approximately 440,000 square feet of commercial space, publicly accessible open space, and parking all built across multiple phases. The overall site is bound by S. Cicero Ave to the east, W. 45th St to the south, S. Lavergne Ave to the west, and the Stevenson Expressway to the north. The first residential phase is a smaller portion of the overall site, bound by S. Cicero Ave to the east, S. La Crosse Ave to the west, W. 44th St to the north, and W. 45th St to the south. With a total of 183 residential units, this phase will have two six-story mixed-use buildings located at 4400 S. Cicero and 4458 S. Cicero. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the massing of buildings have been broken down into multiple intersecting volumes, with the materiality of the brick color palette selected to further break down the massing. A similar massing strategy and material palette will be used on both buildings to unify them while using different window articulations to give each of them their own identity. Both will have space on the exterior for community art. A public courtyard will separate the two buildings along S. Cicero Ave as the beginning of a green belt through the entire master plan. The buildings will share 134 parking spaces in surface lots to the west. Designed as an L-shaped building, the north building at 4400 S. Cicero will have 110 residential units, with a mix of 21 studios, 64 one-beds, 21 two-beds, and 4 three-beds occupying the upper five floors. The ground floor will feature retail space for Chicago Commons Early Childhood Center along the entire S. Cicero Ave frontage, with the residential lobby facing W. 44th St. A fitness center, flex space, admin space, mail room, laundry room, and bike room for 40 bikes will round out the ground floor on the west wing of the floor plate. Planned as a bar-shaped building, the south building at 4458 S. Cicero will rise 70 feet tall just like the northern building. On the inside, the slightly smaller building will have just 73 apartments, with a mix of 9 studios, 46 one-beds, and 18 two-beds. The ground floor will have corner retail at the intersection of S. Cicero Ave and W. 45th St, with the residential lobby fronting S. Cicero Ave in the middle of the building’s street frontage. The north end of the ground floor will have fitness space, flex space, and residential amenity space as well as a laundry room and bike room for 30 bikes.  As a CHA-led development, more than 50% of the residential units will exceed ARO requirements and CHA units will be affordable to residents earning between 0-80% AMI. The buildings will also include a small portion of market-rate apartments. While no new buildings have broken ground on the overall site yet, CHA and The Habitat Company have been making steps towards getting the properties ready for new construction. 2023 saw the completion of water main work on the site and the finalizing of the infrastructure agreement with the city. Further infrastructure work is expected to commence in Q1 2024. When the development was approved by the Plan Commission in 2021, the first phase of the overall master plan was also approved, which included a grocery store building and a medical office building. This commercial phase is set to break ground in Q2 2024 after the infrastructure work is in place and final financing has been secured. For the residential buildings at 4400 S. Cicero and 4458 S. Cicero, The Habitat Company and CHA are working together with IHDA and the City of Chicago to put together an agreement on the financing. The team expects to spend 2024 working on the financing package and moving forward with the next phase of the architectural drawings to get pricing and finalize the design. They expect an early 2025 closing on the financing with groundbreaking following that. Construction would take approximately 14-15 months. ",Garfield Ridge,1.0
700 units of mixed-income housing planned for vacant LeClaire Courts site,"The Chicago Housing Authority and private developers are moving forward with a plan to reimage the vacant 32-acre former site of the LeClaire Courts housing complex in the Garfield Ridge neighborhood. If realized, the $350 million mixed-use plan could be one of the largest real estate projects to come to the Southwest Side in recent history.  Located along Cicero Avenue south of the Stevenson Expressway and a mile-and-a-half north of Midway Airport, the LeClaire Courts site has sat idle since the CHA demolished the original 1950s-era housing complex in 2011. Redeveloping the parcel—and providing a required minimum of 186 homes for displaced CHA residents—has been a long and slow-moving process for the Chicago Housing Authority. The city agency started its search for developers in 2016 and in 2019 formed LeClaire Partners: a joint venture between itself and developers Cabrera Capital Markets, and The Habitat Company. At a virtual community meeting in December, the team finally shared its site plan, designed by Knight Engineers & Architects and Solomon Cordwell Buenz. The multiphase proposal calls for roughly 700 mixed-income residences comprising CHA, affordable, and market-rate units. The development will also provide new retail, offices, open space, parking lots, and facilities offering services like daycare and job training. According to the team, the first phase will include two 80-foot-tall mid-rise buildings with a combined 250 residences as well as a new grocery store at the corner of 44th Street and Cicero Avenue. Future phases will encompass about a dozen low-rise residential buildings situated west of phase one. In addition to holding community meetings to discuss the plan, the development team also filed a zoning application with the city late last month—a clear indication that they're serious about moving forward. The proposal will still need to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the Chicago City Council for a final vote. The developers hope to get approvals and financing in the third quarter of this year and break ground by late 2021 or early 2022. Construction of the first phase is expected to take 18 months, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. ",Garfield Ridge,0.0
Permits issued for mixed-use lowrise at 1043 N. Rush,"Developer L3 Capital has received permits to build its planned two-story mixed-use building at 1043 N. Rush. Located between E. Bellevue Pl and E. Cedar St, the project site is currently home to a small two-story building holding Carmine’s. Designed by GREC Architects, the new two-story multi-tenant building planned for the site will consist of retail on the ground floor and new restaurant space on the second floor. Upon the expiration of their current lease, Carmine’s plans to relocate to the second floor of the new building which will also include a private outdoor terrace overlooking the N. Rush St corridor. The terrace will be used for white tablecloth dining to replace their current ground floor patio seating.  According to the leasing flyer, the ground floor will offer four retail spaces, measuring 2,345 square feet, 2,237 square feet, 2,097 square feet, and 1,447 square feet. The smallest space will likely be the street frontage for Carmine’s. The retail spaces will be well curated to complement the existing surrounding tenancy, specifically targeting tenants in the luxury, athleisure, and direct-to-consumer categories. The developers received a demolition permit for the existing structure as well as a new building permit for the replacement structure.

OMA/AMO rethinks Stone Island retail identity,"OMA / AMO has partnered with Stone Island to develop a new identity for the Italian brand’s stores. Positioned as spaces to share its wealth of experiences with its communities, Stone Island has defined the new stores through its research and experimentation on design and product manipulation.  The new store concept features altar-like spaces highlighting Stone Island’s devotion to technology and development, shared by its followers. Niches for archival pieces and prototypes – results of years of experimentation in Stone Island’s lab in their Ravarino headquarters – showcase past thinking and future ambitions about product design. Beyond shop opening hours, the space will host public presentations, salons, workshops, and private events. The stores form a base for current and new customers, complementing the brand’s online presence. Stone Island’s approach in transforming materials from typical into unique inspires and informs the new stores’ architecture. The stone-like palette of the spaces is formed with specially treated off-the-shelf materials – without actual concrete or stone. Shredded paper and resins are compressed under high pressure to become durable “concrete panels”. Cork – the central material to the Stone Island stores – is burnt, sandblasted and coated, turning dark and textured, while maintaining its sound-absorbing, humidity-controlling features. Corrugated steel panels, sand-coated, acquire a soft surface. A large digital chandelier, suspended from the ceiling, broadcasts Stone Island’s culture to its community. Stone Island Creative Director and President Carlo Rivett stated that, “Stone Island and AMO share values of innovation, functionality, and passion. I am very happy to begin this important partnership, a new visual approach for our stores, to speak to our communities.” AMO Director Samir Bantal added that, “Research and innovation are at the core of Stone Island. The space, materiality, and program of the stores underpin the brand’s ethos, and reinforce a sense of belonging of its community of like-minded people.” The new concept debuted within a new, 1,900 square foot retail space for Stone Island in Chicago which opened on Thursday, October 20, 2022, ahead of the future opening of locations in Seoul, Munich and Stockholm. Located at 48 E. Oak St, the location is the brand’s first in the city. ",Gold Coast,0.0
Developer plans mixed-use low-rise at 1043 N. Rush,"Developer L3 Capital is looking to develop a two-story mixed-use building at 1043 N. Rush. Located between E. Bellevue Pl and E.

Committee on Design reviews 12 W. Maple,"The Committee on Design has reviewed a proposal for a residential tower at 12 W. Maple. Planned by Fern Hill Company and Calmwater Capital, the project will be located just west of Mariano Park and the intersection of W. Maple St and N. State St. The tight site is currently occupied by a four-story masonry building and small one-story structure. With Lamar Johnson Collaborative as the architect, the new development will consist of a 34-story residential tower. Planned to rise 449 feet, the building will deliver 54 luxury condominium residences. Tenants will have access to 81 parking spaces accessed by two vertical car lifts managed by a dedicated valet. Amenities will be located at the 7th and 18th floors of the tower. Drawing from the context of the Gold Coast and the shores of Lake Michigan, the tower’s massing has been carved in strategic locations based on unit layouts and orientation of views to the east. The exterior terraces are anchored by landscape, providing native grasses on every terrace and trees at the 7th floor outdoor terrace. At the ground floor, special attention was paid to the pedestrian experience with high quality natural limestone and metal paneling brought down to the ground along the W. Maple St facade. The residential entry will be along the western end of the street frontage, with a curb cut placed to allow for cars to enter an internal motor court, bringing pick-up, drop-off, deliveries, and valet queuing off of the street. The discussion opened with John Ronan questioning the blank western wall created by placing the core along the western property line of the building. Ronan suggested that this blank wall seems unnecessary, and the corridor and elevators could be flipped to allow for a light-filled corridor facing west. Later in the discussion, Sara Beardsley suggested bringing some kind of activation or massing articulation to the west elevation so that the building wouldn’t seemingly turn its back on its neighbors to the west Brian Lee reiterated the idea of the building’s relation to its neighbors later saying the current design is thumbing its nose to the neighbors to the west and reconfiguring the core would be very helpful. John Ronan chimed in and asked if the core could be oriented east to west which could help achieve units with three-direction exposures. The design team responded that they can’t use any exposure facing west for light and ventilation requirements due to being up against the property line but reconfiguring the core could work well to improve the western elevation.  The next point came from Reed Kroloff who asked why there are so many car parking spaces in the project and whether the curb cut is really needed along W. Maple St. The design team responded that the parking ratio is in response to market demands and that the height of the parking podium allows for the amenity deck to sit just above the adjacent building to the east. In regard to the curb cut, the alley at the back of the site is narrow and is littered with dumpsters and interrupted by electrical poles, so two-way traffic through the alley would be very difficult. While introducing a curb cut was not the first choice, it would allow for vehicles to come off the street and reduce traffic.  Committee member Hana Ishikawa expressed concern for the landscaping planned for the building, discussing how it will be hard to have plantings underneath overhangs be viable in the long-term. Ishikawa also questioned how plantings within private homes could be maintained in the original design intent.  The design team from LJC responded that they have consulted with their in-house landscape architects and are considering the balance between protecting the grasses from the wind and ensuring their viability under the overhangs. With regard to upkeep, the developers plan to implement a program through the eventual HOA that will manage maintenance for the greenery and plantings within the building. The final comment came from Reed Kroloff who identified that the current design calls for natural limestone at the base and cost-effective precast concrete for the upper portion of the tower used to mimic limestone. Kroloff pointed out that those two materials will age and color differently resulting in a two-tone facade over time. Kroloff encouraged the design and development team to bring integrity to the facade by either bringing the limestone all the way up or taking the precast concrete panels down to the base. After this meeting, the project will continue going through the city review process, with these comments integrated into those future discussions. As the project looks to rezone the site, it will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. The developers are looking to secure approvals before looking at a timeline for leasing and construction.  ",Gold Coast,0.0
Lawson House renovation scores $74M permit,"As construction wraps up on downtown's massive One Chicago project, work is ready to begin across the street on an ambitious makeover of the former Lawson House YMCA. On Wednesday, Holsten Real Estate Development received a $74.2 million renovation permit to convert the 24-story historic tower at 30 W. Chicago Avenue from 538 single-room occupancy (SRO) units into 409 affordable apartments. Built in 1931, the Lawson House was designed by architects Perkins, Chatten & Hammond in the Art Deco style and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Holsten acquired the property in 2014 under an agreement that it must remain affordable housing for at least 50 years. The renovated units will meet modern standards and include private kitchens and bathrooms as well as air conditioning. The building's entrance will be moved from Chicago Avenue to Dearborn Street, and its old-school gymnasium turned into a modern fitness center. The long-discussed plan also calls for on-site social services and ground-floor retail space. Last month the city of Chicago approved a multifamily loan of up to $17.59 million for the renovation, the Sun-Times reported. Other financing sources include a $79.38 million bridge loan from Chase Bank, a $17.2 million loan from the Illinois Housing Development Authority, $12.4 million in historic preservation tax credits, and affordable housing tax credits. The total project cost is an estimated $122 million. Construction on the Lawson House is expected to last two-and-a-half years. The building's previous tenants will be relocated to suitable housing and given priority when the building reopens in 2024. The permit lists Farr Associates as the project architect and Walsh Construction as the general contractor.  ",Gold Coast,0.0
345-foot-tall Gold Coast rental tower advances,"After winning the approval of the Chicago Plan Commission in August, a 345-foot-tall apartment tower slated for Chicago's Gold Coast has cleared another important hurdle. On Wednesday, the city's Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards voted in favor of the 304-unit project, which will replace the former Barnes & Noble bookstore at the southwest corner of State and Elm. Developed by Quick's LLC, an affiliate of Chicago-based Newcastle Limited, the 30-story proposal has been under discussion for more than two years. The developer initially pitched a 39-story tower with 368 apartments but was shot down by Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd). Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the revised development features a glassy facade with several setbacks that align with the heights of nearby buildings.  The tower also includes commercial retail space and a 132-car parking garage. A second subarea within the site's boundaries would redevelop the next-door Lou Malnati's pizzeria property with a new two-story commercial building. The structure would be set back from State street and line up with the adjacent Viceroy Hotel to create an oversized sidewalk for outdoor dining. Lou Malnati's currently has a long-term lease at 1120 N. State, so it's unclear when phase two would begin.  Although the site's underlying zoning of DX-7 Downtown Mixed-Use District remains unchanged under the plan, Ald. Hopkins and other city officials had to review and approve the project's Residential-Business Planned Development. The full City Council still needs to sign off on the measure, which could happen as soon as next week.  The developer is required to provide 10 percent affordable housing units and will fulfill its obligation by building eight of the required 30 apartments on-site and make a $4.1 million cash payment into the city's affordable housing fund. New citywide rules requiring 20 percent affordability take effect in October, so the State Street project could be one of the last big high-rises to squeak in under the old regulations.   Newcastle hopes to begin demolition of the former bookstore building in spring 2022. Construction on the new apartment tower is expected to start no earlier than fall 2022 and wrap up in the first half of 2024.    ",Gold Coast,0.0
12-story rental complex reaches final height in Gold Coast,"The 12-story mixed-use development known as Gild has reached its final height at the northwest corner of State Parkway and Division Street in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood.  Developed by Newcastle Limited and designed by architecture firm CallisonRTKL, the upcoming mid-rise structure replaced a cluster of low-rise commercial buildings. The project calls for 18,000 square feet of retail, parking for 33 cars, and 89 high-end rental units. The apartments are offered in studio, one-, and two-bedroom layouts and 70 percent will feature private balconies. ""The excitement of topping out never gets old,"" said Chris Goray, vice president of Power Construction, in a statement to Urbanize. ""Thank you to all the trades women and men who helped us reach this milestone."" Crews will continue to install Gild's exterior cladding and bring ""first-class interior finishes"" to the project, Goray said. ""We are excited about the progress of our development,"" added Newcastle managing director Kurt Pairitz in a statement. ""Despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, everything is on schedule thanks to the hard work of everyone involved. We look forward to opening in spring 2022.""

Proposed Gold Coast rental tower returns with changes,"After more than two years of discussions and design revisions, developer Newcastle Limited shared its latest plans to redevelop the former Gold Coast Barnes & Noble bookstore at 1130 N. State Street into a 29-story high-rise with 304 rental units. The 345-foot-tall proposal boasts a series of refinements since the last community presentation, hosted by Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) last fall. ""The plans that we shared in October were the result of more than 100 meetings with residents, neighborhood organizations, and owners associations, and led to meaningful changes that I believe made this a far better project,"" said Newcastle's Mike Haney at a recent community meeting. ""We submitted the plans to Chicago Department of Planning and Development and their feedback further improved the project, especially the pedestrian experience and how the building relates to its surroundings,"" Haney said. Revisions include wider sidewalks and reduced second-floor retail space as well as a substantial reworking of the glassy tower's crown and massing.   ""Previously we had a very gentle step at the top,"" said Chris Pemberton, an architect with Solomon Cordwell Buenz. ""Planning asked us to study a one-thirds and two-thirds relationship where the lower step relates to the height of the Viceroy [Hotel] and the upper steps relate to 1135 N. Dearborn and 4 E. Elm."" The plan includes 105 parking spaces, eight on-site affordable-rate apartments, and will make an $8.1 million contribution to the city's affordable housing and neighborhood opportunity funds. The project also takes into account the eventual redevelopment of the one-story Lou Malnati's pizzeria next door. Envisioned as a later phase, the new Lou's will be set back from the street to provide a large sidewalk dining area, similar to the adjacent Viceroy. In 2019, Newcastle originally pitched a 39-story proposal with 368 apartments for the Barnes & Noble site, but that plan was shot down by Ald. Brian Hopkins. The elected official called the previous design unattractive and ""excessively tall for that lot,"" telling the Chicago Tribune that the development team ""missed the mark on all counts."" Hopkins says he's still collecting neighborhood feedback on the current design.  ""No decision has been made yet whether [this proposal] will get my support, but we are giving it its due process, which it's certainly entitled to have,"" the elected officials said Wednesday. ""I think the development team has worked in good faith with both my office and the community over the number of years that this proposal has been in the conversation."" Wednesday's online community meeting hit the maximum number of attendees and some Gold Coast residents were unable to tune in. Ald. Hopkins says he will host a repeat presentation on Monday, June 28th at 6:00 p.m. The public can register for that Zoom meeting here.  The high-rise proposal at 1130 N. State is not seeking a change to the downtown site's underlying zoning but it will need to go through the city's Planned Development process, which requires the approval of the alderman, the Plan Commission, and the City Council. If approvals go as planned, Newcastle expects demolition of the bookstore to take place in spring 2022. Construction is anticipated to begin in fall 2022 and wrap up in early 2024.   ",Gold Coast,0.0
29-story rental tower slated for State Street Barnes & Noble moves forward,"UPDATE: Ald. Brian Hopkins says he will host an online community meeting to discuss the latest revisions to the 1130 N. State Street proposal on Wednesday, June 23 at 6:00 p.m. Click here to register for the virtual event. A long-discussed plan to demolish the former Barnes & Noble bookstore at 1130 N. State Street and redevelop the Gold Coast site into a mixed-use high-rise is inching closer to reality. Developer Newcastle Limited recently filed a zoning application for a 29-story tower—an indication the proposal is advancing. Newcastle originally pitched a 39-story tower with 368 apartments, but that plan was shot down by Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) in 2019. The elected official called the previous design unattractive and ""excessively tall for that lot,"" telling the Chicago Tribune that the development team ""missed the mark on all counts."" The latest plan was presented to Gold Coast neighbors in October. The Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed building shrunk from 465 to 326 feet tall and will feature 304 luxury rental units, 31,000 square feet of retail space, and parking for 132 cars. There will be eight affordable units on-site and the developer will pay $8.1 million into the city's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund and Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. The development boundaries include the Lou Malnati's pizzeria to the immediate south, but the restaurant will remain in place for the time being. A later phase would demolish the low-rise restaurant and erect a new structure for Lou Malnati's which will be set further back from the street to create a larger sidewalk and additional outdoor dining space.  The high-rise proposal at 1130 N. State is not seeking a change to the site's underlying zoning but it will need to go through the city's Planned Development process, which requires the approval of the alderman, the Plan Commission, and the City Council. It's unclear if the current plan has the support of Ald. Hopkins, and the alderman's office did not respond to a request for comment. If and when the project is approved by the city, Newcastle plans to demolish the former bookstore within 12 months. Construction on the new tower would take approximately 24 months, according to the developer.  Newcastle is also the developer behind the upcoming 12-story Gild apartments at nearby 1210 N. State Parkway. Currently under construction, the 89-unit rental building is expected to welcome residents in early 2022. ",Gold Coast,0.0
'Gild' apartments go vertical in Gold Coast,"After breaking ground late last year, the 12-story apartment development known as Gild is rising above street level at the northwest corner of State and Division in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood.  Developed by Newcastle Limited, Gild replaces a cluster of demolished low-rise commercial buildings that once contained businesses such as McFadden’s, Tip Top Inn, and Hash House a Go Go. The upcoming development will bring 18,000 square feet of new retail space to the corner and top it with 89 high-end rental units. Gild's apartments will be offered in studio, one-, and two-bedroom layouts, and the majority of units will feature private balconies. The plan also includes an outdoor deck for tenants, a green roof, and 33 off-street parking spaces, according to the project's building permit. Gild is expected to welcome renters in early 2022. Chicago-based architecture firm CallisonRTKL designed Gild to fit in more than stand out. The conservative-looking building is clad in warm brick and panels that will ""represent but not imitate"" its older neighbors to the north, architect Keith Campbell told Curbed in 2019. Meanwhile, Newcastle is eyeing an even larger rental development for the former Barnes & Noble bookstore site located at nearby 1130 N. State Street. Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) rejected the developer's initial plans for a 39-story apartment tower at the site in 2019, but a redesigned and scaled-back 29-story proposal is currently under review.  ",Gold Coast,0.0
Permits are in the works for Halsted Pointe Phase 1 ,"10/25/23: This article has been updated with the revised timeline of breaking ground in 2024. Permits have been filed for the 46-story mixed-use first phase of Halsted Pointe. Initially approved back in late summer 2021, the development will replace the current Greyhound Bus facility at 901 N. Halsted on the southern tip of Goose Island. After demolition permits were issued in May, the site has been cleared in preparation for the new development. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the 46-story mixed-use tower has been designed with rectilinear corners instead of the original rounded corners, the building massing will feature an angular expression enhanced with depth and plane changes as the tower rises. The facade will feature angled mullions and balcony walls in a captured glass system that uses two glazing and mullion colors.  At the base, the sloped site creates a series of lower floors meeting different elevations around the building. The lowest level will be fully submerged and house retail parking and mechanical spaces. The next level up will front N. Halsted St with 13,300 square feet of retail. Above that, the official first floor will have leasing offices facing north, the residential lobby facing east, and 5,600 square feet of retail facing south.  The building’s podium will span from the 2nd through 5th floors, holding 8 units per floor in the northern section under the tower, and parking spaces in the remaining floor plate to the south. The podium will have a total of 200 parking spaces. A full indoor amenity suite including a spa/wellness space, fitness center, game room, and party room and lounge will occupy the sixth floor, opening up to an outdoor amenity deck that will include a pool.  With a total of 460 apartments, the typical residential floors will have 12 units per level made up of a mix of one-beds, one-bed flexes, two-beds, and three-beds, representing a shift to larger units with more bedrooms per floor. Every unit will feature a balcony. Overall, Onni Group is planning four phases of development for the site that is expected to deliver up to 2,650 residential units, retail space, a hotel, and 1,470 parking spaces. Subsequent phases haven’t been fully designed but preliminary approvals suggest a potential for four more towers rising up to almost 700 feet tall.

Onni receives approval for revised Phase 1 at Halsted Pointe ,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development recently granted Onni Group site plan approval and a minor change request for the first phase of Halsted Pointe.  Initially approved back in late summer 2021, the development will replace the current Greyhound Bus facility at 901 N. Halsted on the southern tip of Goose Island. After demolition permits were issued in May, the site has been cleared in preparation for the new development. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the original plan for the first phase called for a 46-story tower rising 504 feet. The revised scheme will include a minor haircut from the planned 504 feet down to 497 feet. The 460 residential units and 200 parking spaces will remain while the 20,000 square feet of retail has been solidified at a slightly lower 18,900 square feet.  While the tower’s massing will stay more or less the same, the new design replaces the rounded corners of the building with rectilinear corners. The new building massing will feature an angular expression enhanced with depth and plane changes as the tower rises. The new facade will feature angled mullions and balcony walls in a captured glass system that uses two glazing and mullion colors. At the top of the tower, the crown has been reconfigured and the rooftop mechanical screen will use the materials and expression found on the podium, which has also been revised to use more straight corners and an angled expression. At the base, the sloped site creates a series of lower floors meeting different elevations around the building. The lowest level will be fully submerged and house retail parking and mechanical spaces. The next level up will front N. Halsted St with 13,300 square feet of retail. Above that, the official first floor will have leasing offices facing north, the residential lobby facing east, and 5,600 square feet of retail facing south.  The podium will span from the 2nd through 5th floors, holding 8 units per floor in the northern section under the tower, and parking spaces in the remaining floor plate to the south.

City Council approves Mars Wrigley expansion,"City Council has approved plans by Mars Wrigley for a new pilot plant on their Goose Island campus. Located at the northern tip of Goose Island, the Mars Wrigley campus is bound by W. Blackhawk st to the south and N. Cherry Ave to the east. The Morton Salt redevelopment is located almost directly across the river to the west. With a design by CRB Group, the new facility will be a one-story building spanning 45,000 square feet. Placed directly south of the current pilot plant, the 30-foot-tall building has been designed to match the existing buildings on campus, using precast concrete and metal panels in a similar color to the existing plant.  The program of the building is intended to test and assemble new products, augmenting the services already performed in the existing plant. Some of the spaces include receiving, ingredient processing, a test kitchen, tech development, barline, and storage. Employees will enter at the western side of the building in an outcropping that will hold locker rooms as well as a break room space. This portion of the building will be clad in glass curtain wall to allow for increased light exposure for employees. Since the new building will replace existing surface parking, Mars Wrigley has acquired the parking lot to the east of N. Cherry Ave and this approval will incorporate it into the campus. Defunct railroad tracks along the parking lot will be replaced with a dedicated bike and pedestrian path. The development will include new trees planted around the campus and new bike parking. The building is expected to meet LEED Silver and reduce indoor water use by 40%. Construction on the $40 million project is expected to begin in June 2022 and complete one year later in June 2023.

City commissioners OK five-tower Goose Island megadevelopment,"A $1.3 billion project to redevelop an 8-acre site at the southern tip of Goose Island into five high-rises is one step closer to becoming a reality after the Chicago Plan Commission voted in favor of the massive riverfront proposal. Dubbed ""Halsted Pointe,"" the four-phase development from Vancouver-based Onni Group and Chicago's Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture will be built over 8 to 10 years at the former Greyhound bus maintenance facility at 901 N. Halsted Street. When complete, it will deliver 2,650 rental apartments (20 percent will be affordable), 300 hotel rooms, 1,400 parking spaces, 3.8 acres of publicly accessible open space, and a new pedestrian bridge connecting to the riverwalk promenade at 600 W. Chicago.  

 The first phase tower will rise 504 feet at the northwest corner of the site and will contain 485 apartments, 200 parking spaces, and a grocery store. The Plan Commission presentation showed the later phases of the project as ""placeholder"" designs that would be further refined at a later date to give each building a different identity. The third phase tower will top out at an impressive 691 feet, according to massing diagrams. Halsted Pointe will require a zoning change from DS-5 (Downtown Service District) to DX-5 (Downtown Mixed-Use District) and then to a Waterway-Residential-Business Planned Development. The change will need to go before the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council for final approval. Future phases will still go before the Plan Commission for a courtesy presentation, and the commissioners will have an opportunity to provide feedback.

Goose Island megaproject gets height bump,"Onni Group's five-tower ""Halsted Pointe"" megadevelopment on Goose Island is headed to the Chicago Plan Commission this week with some noteworthy changes. In addition to now spelling Pointe with an ""e"" at the end, the massive multiphase proposal has grown in height from 584 to 691 feet.  The increase mainly affects the development's third phase tower located at the site's southern tip, where the north branch of the Chicago River and the North Branch Canal split. While earlier plans for the residential high-rise called for roughly 640 rental units, that tower is now shown containing 1,015 apartments.  Despite these changes, the development's total number of dwelling units remains unchanged at 2,650. The second phase, located just north of the taller third phase tower, received a reduction in both height and density. The overall amount of parking has come down slightly from 1,470 to 1,400 spaces. One notable absence from the revised plans is an updated rendering of the redesigned towers from project designer Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture. The Plan Commission presentation posted by the city's Department of Planning and Development includes several slides that simply read ""rendering in progress."" Hopefully those images will be ready in time for the upcoming Plan Commission vote, which is scheduled for Thursday, August 19, at 10 a.m. If the project's zoning is approved by the Plan Commission and City Council, Onni aims to break ground on Halsted Pointe's first phase—a 46-story, 485-unit residential tower at the site's northwest corner—sometime next year.  Construction on phase one is expected to take 24 to 30 months, a representative from the developer said in April. Five towers will eventually occupy the 8-acre site at 901 N. Halsted Street, which was previously home to a Greyhound bus maintenance facility. The Halsted Pointe masterplan also includes up to 300 hotel rooms, a grocery store, an outdoor market and ""social lawn,"" and a new pedestrian bridge connecting to the riverfront promenade at 600 W. Chicago.    ",Goose Island,0.0
Halsted Point: A five-tower plan for the tip of Goose Island,"Vancouver-based developer Onni Group has revealed its plans for ""Halsted Point,"" a four-phase project that would bring five high-rise towers ranging from 28 to 56 stories to the southern edge of Goose Island. The massive mixed-use proposal calls for 2.7 million square feet of development an 8-acre site previously home to the Greyhound bus maintenance facility at 901 N. Halsted Street. The completed project will deliver 2,650 rental apartments (20 percent on-site affordable), 108,000 square feet of office space, 54,000 square feet of retail, 1340 linear feet of public riverwalk, and 3.8 acres of open space. ""Given this scale of this community and certain economic realities, this will be a multiphase project,"" said Onni vice president of development Brian Brodeur at a virtual community meeting on Thursday. ""We are anticipating this to be a four-phase project beginning early next year. The timing of subsequent phases will be based on market demand, but we feel this will be a 10-plus-year overall build-out."" Onni still needs zoning approval for Halsted Point, but it aims to break ground on the first phase—a 46-story residential tower and grocery store at the site's northwest corner—in 2022. Construction on phase one is expected to take 24 to 30 months. Later phases will be added in a clockwise pattern and call for three more residential towers (the tallest rising 584 feet) and a commercial high-rise with offices and hotel rooms.  The commercial tower will be located on the southwest corner to act as a ""buffer"" between the new residential towers and the site's industrial neighbors. ""We believe residential is going be much quicker to come back post-pandemic than commercial,"" said Brodeur. ""That's the reason we've phased our site the way we have, with our commercial building last."" The five-tower is designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the Chicago-based firm that also designed Onni's multiphase Old Town Park development at Division and Wells. Architect Aracely Nevarez described the glassy towers at Halsted Point as a ""modern and sculpted"" response to the city skyline, while the brick-clad lower levels tie into the industrial buildings found in the area. The project's buildings are aligned in a way that keeps the tip of the island, arguably the site's best real estate, open. ""We had an opportunity to place a tower right at the corner and take full advantage of the city skyline views,"" explained Nevarez. ""But the more we studied this, it made more sense to leave that area open and create a social lawn that can be enjoyed by all."" The so-called ""social lawn"" is joined by other open space improvements including a new riverwalk and bike trails around the site's parameter and a ""market plaza"" that will act as the development's town square. Halsted Point is also designed to connect to the nearby Wild Mile—an ongoing initiative to naturalize the North Branch Canal into an eco-park and boardwalk. There are plans to construct a new pedestrian bridge connecting Halsted Point to the riverfront promenade at 600 W. Chicago. That portion of the plan will need the cooperation of the Army Corps of Engineers to become a reality, the development team said. The completed project will contain 1,470 parking spaces. The majority of the stalls as well as all of the site's loading and trash removal will be located below grade. The plan does feature some above-grade parking, but the spaces will be concealed behind active uses such as rental townhouses included in the second and third phases. The developers will work with CDOT to widen Halsted Street, eliminate on-street parking, upgrade signals, and make turn lane and bike lane improvements near the site. There are currently no plans to widen either of the Halsted Street bridges, but the development is situated along the future route of a potential transitway identified in the city's North Branch Framework Plan. The Halsted Point project will use no controversial TIF money. The developers will contribute more than $28 million to the city, including Industrial Corridor System Fees and payments into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. According to Onni, the development is expected to create just shy of 10,000 construction jobs and generate $716 million in taxes over the next 20 years. Onni closed a deal to purchase the Greyhound site for $38 million in early 2019. ""When I was kid, growing up right over the bridge from, here we used to call this area ghost town,"" said Ald. Walter Burnett (27th) at Thursday's meeting. ""Now this area is very vibrant. We're allowing for some residential [development], some new infrastructure is getting built, and the riverwalk is getting enhanced. A lot of great things are happening.""   ",Goose Island,0.0
Developer pursuing timber office building on Goose Island,"Hines Interests is ready to move forward with a long-discussed plan to construct a six-story mass timber office building on Goose Island. The developer revealed 'T3' (which for stands timber, technology, and transit) back in 2017, but recently brought on Stream Realty Partners to actively market the North Branch project to potential tenants. ""We're feeling energized coming out of the pandemic,"" Hines managing director Brian Atkinson told Urbanize. ""And we think there's an opportunity in timber.""  Chicago has a firey history when it comes to wooden structures, but modern mass timber meets or exceeds the stringent fire rating standards set by the City of Chicago. On top of being more sustainable than concrete and steel alternatives, timber construction may play a vital role in attracting tenants. ""We've seen the benefits of biophilic design: what it does for people's moods as well the antimicrobial properties of timber,"" explained Atkinson. Additionally, the loft-style layout offers a chance for greater light and air, outdoor tenant spaces on every level, and the same indoor air quality found in brand new trophy towers. ""We're believers in this product typology,"" said Atkinson. ""Older industrial warehouses offer a great aesthetic and vibe, and this would be a new construction version."" Designed by architecture firm DLR Group, the 270,000-square-foot T3 Chicago project is slated for 1017 W. Division Street—ironically, the former site of Big Bay Lumber Yard. Atkinson believes that the project's location outside of Chicago's Central Business District could also be a selling point for tenants looking to avoid the density of downtown.  As Hines continues to work on the 1.2 million-square-foot Salesforce Tower, Atkinson says he is aware of the difficulties facing the larger office market but he has reasons to be optimistic looking forward.  ""Obviously there are real challenges,"" said Atkinson. ""We do not have robust occupancy downtown. But we're seeing green shoots, too. Employees want to come back to work. People have been trying to work from home, but are missing out on opportunities for socialization, mentorship, and career development. You can't do those things without in-person interaction."" Atkinson said the lull in the market is due to lease terms being cut in half as tenants seek short-term solutions and deffer decision-making. ""We think that there will be significant leasing activity in the latter half of the year."" According to Atkinson, the pandemic has been an opportunity to rethink how companies use their space and attract employees. ""Before, our focus was attracting millennials. Now it's how do we make the senior partners who have been working from home (or their second home) feel comfortable and want to come back?"" asked Atkinson. ""We think it's driving a flight towards quality."" If Hines can sign up tenants for T3, the Goose Island project is positioned to move forward relatively quickly. The development complies with the site's current zoning and will not need to go through the city's approval process. ""It takes very little time to construct these buildings. We can go from a hole in the ground to outfitting tenant spaces in 10 to 15 months. Raw material costs are up, but there are savings in the cost of execution.""   ",Goose Island,0.0
"Plan to build 2,650 residences on Goose Island moves forward","On Thursday evening, Onni Group will take the wraps off its long-rumored plan to turn the southern tip of Goose Island into a massive, multiphase development with 2,650 residential units.  The Vancouver-based developer will present its plans for the property located at 901 N. Halsted Street at a public webinar hosted by Neighbors of River West and Near North Unity Program. The proposed development, which also includes ""commercial uses,"" will replace a Greyhound bus maintenance facility. Greyhound put its 8-acre property up for sale in 2017, and Onni closed a deal to pay $38 million for the site in early 2019. Onni's Goose Island plans will require city zoning approval to move forward. The development team hasn't shared any site plans or renderings of the upcoming project, but it's a safe bet that it involves multiple high-rise apartment towers and waterfront open space, as outlined in the city's 2017 North Branch Framework Plan and design guidelines. Chicago architecture firm Lamar Johnson Collaborative posted a Greyhound Masterplan for a ""confidential client"" on its website, which provides some sense of the development's potential scale. It's unclear if LJC is actively involved in Onni's plans. It's possible the architect created the renderings as a conceptual design study or for a different developer eying the site. If approved, Onni's proposal would represent a major shift for Goose Island, which has long been home to industries, not people. A sweeping rezone of the North Branch Corridor opened the island and surrounding industrial land to mixed-use developments like Lincoln Yards, the River District, Triangle Square, and others. Thursday's online presentation for 901 N. Halsted is scheduled for 6:00 p.m. and all are encouraged to tune in. Zoom log-in information can be found on this meeting notice shared by the River North Residents Association.  ",Goose Island,0.0

City Council approves funding for 3831 W. Chicago,"The Chicago City Council has approved funding for a mixed-use development at 3831 W. Chicago. Planned by 548 Capital, the project will occupy a block-long site between N. Avers Ave and N. Springfield Ave. The center portion of the property is currently under the ownership of the developer, while the city is selling the lots at each intersection that they currently own. Two city-owned lots along N. Springfield Ave will also be sold and incorporated.

City Council approves Team Pioneros development,"The Chicago City Council has approved the Team Pioneros mixed-use development planned at 1614 N. Pulaski. Planned by Park Row Development, the development was chosen as the winner of the Humboldt Park Invest South/West RFP. Located at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Pulaski Rd, the project site is a vacant lot that is just to the north of the landmark Pioneer Bank Building.  Designed by JGMA, the nine-story building will hold a Chicago Public Library branch, 85 affordable residential units, a health clinic, and 58 parking spaces. The unit mix will consist of 27 one-beds targeted at 60% AMI, 3 one-beds targeted at 30% AMI, 25 two-beds targeted at 60% AMI, 5 two-beds targeted at 30% AMI, 10 three-beds targeted at 60% AMI, 5 three-beds targeted at 30% AMI, 6 four-beds targeted at 60% AMI, and 4 four-beds targeted at 30% AMI. The building’s design stretches the massing of the bank, continuing the history of the bank building and reflecting the Latinx community in the neighborhood. Rising 109 feet tall, the massing is broken up with horizontal and vertical expressions that are reminiscent of the bank’s facade.  The ground floor of the building will hold the new branch of the Chicago Public Library, with its space extending to the second floor via a sculptural learning stair. An opening on the ground floor will act as an open space for the community to gather with opportunities for street vendors to congregate.

Committee on Design reviews The Ave,"The Committee on Design has reviewed The Ave. Chosen as the winner back at the end of 2021, The Ave will occupy the RFP site along W. Chicago Ave between N. Central Park Ave and N. Monticello Ave, where it will replace the current Neighborhood Housing Services office and a one-story commercial building currently owned by the city.  Planned by KMW Communities, POAH and CEC, the four-story project will include 49 affordable apartments, 2,900 square feet of space for Neighborhood Housing Services, an innovation center measuring 2,900 square feet, and 1,800 square feet of available retail space. The building’s unit mix will consist of 19 one-beds, 27 two-beds, and 3 three-beds. Parking for 32 cars will be included on the ground floor. With Gensler and Nia Architects working on the project, the design began with the intent to avoid a simple bar building. The current scheme looks to create a longer building with multiple components. The massing holds the corners at each intersection, carves the middle of the street frontage, and draws the eye into the center plaza space.  The portion along N. Central Park Ave is the tallest portion, creating a stronger presence on one corner. The longer portion of the building is shorter and stretches towards N. Monticello Ave. Dubbed The Stoop, the public space at the center will be the feature space of the project. With Site Design Group on the project, the plaza will be designed as a multi-use space that will be overlooked by a large screen wall that will house local artwork. Since being selected as the winner of the RFP, the design has changed due to program changes and affordability measures. The top floor of the taller volume was removed, and the NHS office space was moved from two floors of space in the taller volume over to the ground floor of the shorter volume. New residential units were added to the second floor of the taller volume. Rising 49 feet, removing the fifth floor will allow for a less expensive construction method that will make the project more affordable. The building will be clad in a gridded brick facade with wood veneer accent panels and aluminum windows. At the ground floor, angled walls will also be clad in brick. Second floor residential units will have balconies that overlook the street and plaza. The discussion opened with Lesley Roth who liked the geometry of the building but commented that the angled walls needed refinement. Roth followed up with a comment that the second-floor facade still looks like office fenestration and needs to be coordinated with the new residential program behind it.  Sara Beardsley chimed in next to comment that the treatment of the massing was subtle but interesting and thought the feature wall was really nice. Beardsley said that the fortress-like walls at the ground floor could use more refinement. Brian Lee spoke next, asking if the design team considered having the parking garage access be from the alley. The development team responded that they did look at it but opted for a curb cut on N. Central Park Ave due to some concerns about overloading the alley which currently serves the residential neighborhood of single-family homes and two-flats. Lee felt the building was a good example of a well-planned mixed-use development and asked if they considered building taller to get more units. The development team said that 44 units was the original target (the building will now hold 49), and when the program was refined, they were able to fit everything in four floors and use a more affordable construction type.  Renauld Mitchell echoed the sentiments of the others and felt the project was well thought out. Mitchell asked whether the second-floor balconies were a remnant of the earlier scheme or if the intent was to preserve the look now that it is residential. The design team responded that they liked the reveal between the ground floor and upper floors, but it was a fair comment that it needs to look less commercial. With the Committee on Design review complete, the project will continue through the DPD review process. The project is reportedly proceeding under the existing zoning designation but will need city approval for acquiring the city-owned land and if the project ends up requesting city funding.

Above that, the third floor will hold the 58 parking spaces, with the fourth-floor home to amenities including the Humboldt Park Health Counseling Services Center, laundry room, game room, fitness center, lounge, and outdoor terrace. The top five floors will hold all of the residential units, topped by a green roof and solar panels.  The developer is seeking to rezone the site from B3-2 to B3-3 before instituting a Planned Development for the project. While the site is currently privately owned, the developers are close to closing on the purchase of the site. With approval from the Chicago Plan Commission, the proposal will head to the Committee on Zoning and full City Council.  ",Humboldt Park,1.0
CDC approves $13 million TIF for Pioneer Bank redevelopment,"The Community Development Commission has approved $13 million in TIF funding for the restoration and redevelopment of the Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank Building at 4000 W. North. Located at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Pulaski Ave, the bank building is part of a larger redevelopment by Park Row Development that will see the construction of a new 9-story building on the adjacent vacant lots to the north. Built in 1925, the Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank Building will be redeveloped into a mix of office and incubator spaces. JGMA, the architect for the project, will move its offices into the upper floors of the bank building, while BTEC and Arquitectos will lease the remaining space. BTEC intends to focus on workforce management and community business incubation, while Arquitectos would use the space as their first headquarters to assist local Latino design and engineering firms start and grow their businesses. A community cafe and restaurant will occupy the ground floor of the annex building.  With only the redevelopment of the bank building under consideration within this approval, the project will cost $21.1 million in this first phase. The financing will include $357,000 in developer equity, $2.1 million federal Historic Tax Credit equity, $5.66 million in lender financing, and the aforementioned $13 million in TIF funding from the city.  With CDC approval of the TIF funding, the developer will now work with DPD to write a redevelopment agreement and get it passed by City Council within the first half of 2023. Once the City Council passes the redevelopment agreement, the developers will look to close on the financing and begin construction. With All Construction Group tapped as the general contractor, construction will take 16 months once ground is broken.   ",Humboldt Park,1.0
1203 N. California scores full building permit,"A full building permit has been issued for an affordable housing development located at 1203 N. California Avenue. Currently a vacant lot, the property sits at the southeast corner of Humboldt Park, at the intersection of N. California Ave and W Division St. The development is being led by Hispanic Housing Development Corporation.  With a design from Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the affordable building will stand 9 floors above the street. Rising 95 feet, the building will hold 64 affordable units, made up of 9 one-beds, 15 two-beds, and 40 three-bedroom apartments. 31 units will be rented to those making 30% AMI, 18 units at 50% AMI, and 14 units at 60% AMI. Tenants will have access to 19 car parking spaces and 49 bike parking spaces.  Beginning as an IHDA affordable housing project submission in early 2021, the architects worked through different massing studies and landed on the current design that holds the corner and maintains the street wall. The traditionally styled building features a clearly defined middle, base, and top with a turret at the corner as a distinctive visual anchor. On the ground floor, the building will offer 2,500 square feet of ground floor retail space that will front W. Division St. Along N. California Ave, a community room will hold the corner with the residential entry at the north end of the building. Amenities include an outdoor deck that will include private garden plots, a fitness center on the ground floor, and EV charging stations in the garage.  The structure will meet sustainability requirements by earning the Energy Star, exceeding energy code by 10%, exceeding the stormwater ordinance by 25%, planting 50-100% green roofs, ensuring a 25% indoor water use reduction, providing EV charging stations, and installing a CTA digital display.  The development received zoning approval from the City Council back in February and has received both its foundation and tower crane permits earlier this fall. With Path Construction Company listed as the general contractor, the $29 million construction can now commence. A timeline for construction has not been announced.  ",Humboldt Park,1.0
Final landmark recommendation approved for Pioneer Arcade,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved the final landmark designation for the Pioneer Arcade. Located at 1535 N. Pulaski, the building was designed by Jens J. Jensen and built in 1924-25. With an impressive terracotta facade, the building is one of the last of Chicago’s commercial recreation center buildings. Holding bowling lanes and a billiards hall, the building was a center of neighborhood commercial activity for decades. As proposed, the designation states that the building meets Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage. Bowling and billiards were the staples of entertainment in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Chicago was the midwestern center for the national indoor sports movement, hosting the first modern bowling tournament in 1901 and one of the first billiards world championship tournaments in 1916. Allen Hall, a well-known billiards competitor, made Pioneer Arcade his signature establishment, raising its profile with well-publicized tournament games.  In 1924, the Chicago Tribune reported that the Pioneer Arcade would be “one of the city's finest” and would be “one of the most elaborate recreation buildings in the city”. Opening in 1925, the ground floor was home to four shops and 35 billiards tables. Upstairs, the second floor was home to 16 bowling lanes with a spectator platform looking down onto them. The recreation building thrived as a bowling and billiards hall, becoming a long-term fixture in the social life of Humboldt Park. The second landmark criterion for the building is Criterion 4, for exemplary architecture. As one of the grandest sports halls from the 1920s, the building is an outstanding example of a district commercial building, designed in a version of Spanish Baroque Revival style called Churrigueresque, which refers to the most ornate examples of the overall style. Key elements include the twisted columns, the forms of classical architecture, and the exuberant ornament on the facade, especially above the main entrance. Jens J Jensen was the architect of the building. In its current state, the building’s exterior is mostly intact, with only very minor alterations to the main facade. On the interior, the bowling lanes and billiards hall have been significantly altered with no historic significance remaining. In an unusual circumstance, the building came before the commission with a redevelopment plan to demolish the back portion of the building and use the front section as part of a new development by Hispanic Housing Development Corporation. With UrbanWorks serving as the architect, the development plan calls for the restoration, repair, and integration of the front 35 feet of the Pioneer Arcade, with the rear 85 feet set to be replaced with six stories of senior housing. This new addition will be setback significantly from the street and a new building planned for the vacant site south of the Pioneer Arcade will also be setback from the historic building for visual relief. The muted palette of the new design does not aim to compete with the Pioneer Arcade facade. The developers have received site plan approval from DPD under the property’s existing Planned Development and came to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks consenting to the designation. While a designation usually covers the entire building, the landmark designation will protect all exterior elevations including rooflines, with some additional guidelines and conditions. The designation will recognize the preservation of the north, west, and south elevations 35 feet into the property up to and including the wall of the central stair. The owner may seek demolition of the rear 85 feet of the structure and the commission will approve it given that the front portion is retained, restored, and repaired.  With approval of the final landmark recommendation, the designation will head to City Hall for final approval from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.  ",Humboldt Park,0.0
Landmarks approves Pioneer Bank redevelopment,"The Permit Review Committee has approved planned modifications to the Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank Building at 4000 W. North Ave. Located at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Pulaski Ave, the bank building is part of a larger redevelopment by Park Row Development that will see the construction of a new 9-story building on the adjacent vacant lots to the north. Built in 1924, the Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank Building will be converted into a cultural hub and community center with office space on the upper floors as part of the development. Designed by JGMA, the banking hall will be used as an indoor market and event space, with upper floors being reused as offices for JGMA itself. The restoration of the building will see the front doors to the banking hall repaired with the cast iron surround restored as well. The non-historic canopy will be removed, and a new code-compliant door will be installed in place of the door at the north end of the building frontage. Windows around the exterior will be repaired or replaced as needed, with windows on the north elevation to be removed and infilled with brick in anticipation of the new building to the north. The west elevation will see the carving out of the facade for a set of new windows on the upper floors. On the interior, the bridge over the south apse will get a code-compliant glass guardrail inbound of the existing historic metal railing, overlooking the banking hall. The secondary entrance will be reconfigured with a new stair and elevator along the north wall of the banking hall. After studying multiple locations, the elevator was placed where it can access all floors with minimal disruption. A new bridge will be added in the northern apse with a glass guardrail to connect the mezzanine levels.  While the new building is not under the purview of the Permit Review Committee, the planned building will stand nine floors, encompassing a branch location of the Chicago Public Library, 79 affordable housing units, and a public plaza. The unit mix will consist of 40% one-beds, 30% two-beds, 15% three-beds, and 15% four-beds. 55 parking spaces will be incorporated into the building for residents. Extending the volume of the bank building, the new building extrudes and elongates that massing to the north, extending the history of the bank. This massing was then carved into programmatic volumes with open space for a ground floor public plaza.  With a vote of confidence from the Permit Review Committee, the development has one more approval secured before work begins. The overall project is expected to go through city approvals for a Planned Development and rezoning. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Humboldt Park,1.0

City Council approves 3831 W. Chicago,"The Chicago City Council has approved plans for a mixed-use development at 3831 W. Chicago. Planned by 548 Capital, the project will occupy a block-long site between N. Avers Ave and N. Springfield Ave. The center portion of the property is currently under the ownership of the developer, while the lots at each intersection are currently city-owned. Two city-owned lots along N. Springfield Ave are also part of the project.   Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the mixed-use project will rise four floors, holding 60 apartments, with approximately 7,700 square feet of retail space planned for a grocery store and cafe on the ground floor. Located on the top three floors, the units will be split into 19 studios, 21 one-beds, 15 two-beds, and 5 three-beds. With the building planned as a mixed-income project, 6 apartments will be priced at 30% AMI, 42 at 60% AMI, and 12 rented at market-rate. With community programming on the western end of the ground floor, the space will look out into a covered plaza that sits underneath the building’s overhang. The U-shaped building allows for a parking lot along the alley for 48 cars with access to the grocery store and both residential lobbies. The facade has been designed with a framed grid of window units distinguished with varying patterns of angled frames. Varying modules protrude and are expressed with colored metal accents.   The $40.8 million development will be financed through multiple funding streams. The capital stack includes a private mortgage of $4 million, a deferred developer fee worth $625,000, $385,000 from a ComEd grant, $1.5 million in LIHTC equity, $4.7 million from an ARO contribution, $2.3 million in Donation Tax Credit equity, and the $18.7 million in requested TIF funding.  With City Council approval of the project’s rezoning and Planned Development application, the site is now ready to be developed. The development team is still awaiting City Council approval for the anticipated TIF funding and land sale which was approved by the Community Development Commission in October.

City Council designates Paseo Boricua Flags as landmark ,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation for the Paseo Boricua Gateway Flags. Located in Humboldt Park the two flags mark the economic and social corridor for Puerto Ricans in Chicago. Located along W. Division St, the flags are placed at N. Artesian Ave and N. Mozart St. Built in 1995 with DeStefano Partners as the architect, the flags meet multiple criteria for landmarking. The first is Criterion 1 as they are a critical part of the city’s history. Built out of welded steel tubes, the flags represent the strong Puerto Rican presence in Chicago and, through the structures specifically, represent aspects of Chicago’s industrial production that Puerto Ricans made a large contribution to.  Dedicated on January 6, 1995, on Three Kings Day, the flags transformed the corridor, with 16 new businesses opening that year, with a total of 90 businesses and organizations flourishing along the corridor by 2000. Their importance can be clearly seen in the fact that they have been incorporated into local murals in the area. Criterion 4 is also applicable for the structures’ important architecture. The design of the flags successfully transformed metal tubing into the visual representation of a flowing flag. As the largest flags not made of cloth, they have won numerous awards over the years. Weighing 45 tons, the flags reach a height of 56 feet and span 59 feet over the width of W. Division St. The last applicable criterion is Criterion 7 for a unique or distinctive visual feature. The towering flags act as symbols of consciousness and self-determination and have become a distinctive visual feature of Humboldt Park. The flags also meet the Integrity Criterion as they have not been altered or moved and are in very good condition.  With City Council approval of the landmark designation, the flags will be protected from demolition in the future.

4000 W. North goes before Committee on Design,"The mixed-use project at 4000 W. North Ave has been reviewed by the Committee on Design. Planned by Park Row Development, the development was chosen as the winner of the Humboldt Park Invest South/West RFP. Located at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Pulaski Rd, the project site includes the landmark Pioneer Bank Building at the corner and a vacant lot along N. Pulaski Rd.  Dubbed Pioneros, the mixed-use plan calls for the adaptive reuse of the Pioneer Bank Building and the construction of a new 9-story building. When complete, the new portion will hold a branch location of the Chicago Public Library, 79 affordable housing units, and a public plaza. The bank building will be completely restored and feature a restaurant, community hub, incubator space, and offices for JGMA, the architect behind the proposal. The building design began with massing options that included terracing and rotating. The chosen option was to extend the volume of the bank building, extruding that massing and elongating it to the north, extending the history of the bank. This massing was then carved into programmatic volumes with open space for a ground floor public plaza.  Broken into multiple volumes, the base of the new building will hold the public library branch on the first two floors. Above that, the middle volume will hold 55 parking spaces, topped by an amenity level for the residents. The top portion will hold the 79 residential units, giving every resident expansive views and balconies. The unit mix will consist of 40% one-beds, 30% two-beds, 15% three-beds, and 15% four-beds. The design samples the mix of Latino culture on the facade via the introduction of color placed on perforated sun shades. Attached to the window wall system, the vertical fins are expressed on the apartment massing at the top of the building. While the existing bank building needs lots of restoration work, the intention is to maintain its spatial and volumetric qualities. Interior spaces will be restored and retooled for its future use as a community hub and incubator space. Upper floors will be redesigned for use by JGMA. The existing entries to the bank building will be kept, while connecting to the new building via a secondary entry out to the new public plaza which occupies the vacated alley.  Discussion opened with Philip Enquist expressing his strong dissatisfaction for the connection of the old and new buildings. Enquist didn’t understand why the two structures needed to touch and advocated for the exploration of separation between the two. Enquist also didn’t understand why the plaza was covered by the parking deck and that the plaza design needed a lot more work. The design team responded that they took a lot of cues from and thought of the plaza in the sense of tight urban plazas common in South and Central America. They also commented that the plaza is not fully solved, but is a critical part of the connection between structures and will serve as a community space to have large gatherings and events.  Casey Jones jumped in to echo Enquist’s comments about separating the two buildings, which could increase the access of light into the plaza. Jones also talked about how it would be nice to get more light into the library, wondering if light could be brought down through the parking floors.   Catherine Baker next commented about how there seemed like a lot of parking and asked if it could be reduced. Baker also expressed concern over the unit layouts, especially the four-bedroom unit, which looked to have very small living space for a potential family unit that would have more than 4 people in it. With a question of where people spend their time, Baker also pointed out that with rooftop amenities and the ground floor plaza, it may be difficult to keep all of the spaces active.  The design team responded that they have already reduced the parking from two floors down to one, but did not have time to update the renderings. The units are reportedly still in progress and they will be continued to be refined. The team also pointed out that there are tenant  storage spaces on the amenity level for them to use for extra space needs. Maria Villalobos wrapped up the discussion portion with the praise of color in the building and how it exudes Latin American culture. Villalobos commented about how she was dreaming of the color coming down to the ground and running through the entire project from the facade to the interior to the exterior landscaping. The design team responded that they’re not afraid of color and will explore continuing it around the project. Now the project can move forward in the planning and approval phases. The development will likely require a Planned Development, sending the plan to garner approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. The proposal will likely go before the Commission on Chicago Landmarks due to the landmark status of the Pioneer Bank building and would need to go before the Community Development Commission for any city-owned land sale or TIF request. A timeline for the project is currently unknown. ",Humboldt Park,1.0
Foundation permits issued for UChicago Cancer Center,"Foundation permits have been issued for UChicago Medicine’s free standing cancer center at 5654 S. Drexel. Planned for a site along W. 57th St between S. Drexel Ave and S. Maryland Ave, the 575,000-square-foot facility will provide patients and the community access to the newest diagnostic innovations and leading-edge therapies. Building a world-class cancer center, the university has tapped CannonDesign to design the eight-story building which will be topped with a mechanical penthouse and set into the ground with a lower-level support floor. The 172-foot-tall building has been designed with a series of curved indentations that increase the facade area to allow for more rooms along the exterior and for daylight to reach further into the building. Made up of glass and metal paneling, the facade’s ribbons change opacity to create movement and flow around the building. The building will include 80 private beds dedicated to patients with cancer, split between 64 medical-surgical and 16 ICU. To accommodate overnight stays, family space will be included. 90 consultation and outpatient exam rooms will be included in the building, while a rapid assessment/urgent care clinic will be provided separately to protect immunocompromised oncology patients from exposure to other patients. Bridges will connect to the adjacent parking garage and other hospital tower to the south. More spaces provided by the facility will include infusion therapy rooms grouped by cancer type to replace an outdated open design; cancer imaging equipment (two MRIs, two CT scanners, two ultrasound units, two procedure rooms with mobile C-arm/fluoroscopy and an X-ray); a breast center that will include screening and diagnostic imaging and biopsy rooms; dedicated clinical trial spaces, for streamlined access to the latest research; a center focused on prevention, detection, treatment and survival, offering complementary therapies, stress reduction, community education and well-being support; as well as shell space that can expand vertically and horizontally, providing flexibility for future growth and technology. Outside of the building, the design takes cues from biophilia, with a large pocket park at the southeast corner of the site that connects the campus and becomes a place of respite. A drop-off area along S. Drexel Ave brings cars off the street and is surrounded by landscaping to help create a relaxing and calming space to enter the building. Set to cost $815 million, the new center is expected to serve 200,000 outpatient visits and 5,000 inpatient admissions annually. Permits issued will allow for the construction of foundations for one of the two planned tower cranes and foundations and underground work for the building. With construction officially commenced, general contractor Turner Construction Company will continue work through late 2026, with the facility planned to open to patients in 2027.  ",Hyde Park,0.0

More spaces provided by the facility will include infusion therapy rooms grouped by cancer type to replace an outdated open design; cancer imaging equipment (two MRIs, two CT scanners, two ultrasound units, two procedure rooms with mobile C-arm/fluoroscopy and an X-ray); a breast center that will include screening and diagnostic imaging and biopsy rooms; dedicated clinical trial spaces, for streamlined access to the latest research; a center focused on prevention, detection, treatment and survival, offering complementary therapies, stress reduction, community education and well-being support; as well as shell space that can expand vertically and horizontally, providing flexibility for future growth and technology. Outside of the building, the design takes cues from biophilia, with a large pocket park at the southeast corner of the site that connects the campus and becomes a place of respite. A drop-off area along S. Drexel Ave brings cars off the street and is surrounded by landscaping to help create a relaxing and calming space to enter the building. Set to cost $815 million, the new center is expected to serve 200,000 outpatient visits and 5,000 inpatient admissions annually. The organization will break ground later this year and finish up construction in late 2026, opening to patients in 2027.  ",Hyde Park,0.0
Promontory Point is finally a landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation of Promontory Point. Located east of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable Lake Shore Drive, the promontory sits between 54th and 56th streets in Hyde Park. Built in the 1920s and 30s, the parkland is a peninsula of artificial landfill whose landscaping was designed by Alfred Caldwell.  The curving landform is surrounded by the last remaining limestone revetments along the entire lakefront, providing views of the city and access to the lake. A circular path goes around the promontory with a large, open meadow in the center. Important features include the pavilion building designed by Emmanuel V. Buchsbaum, the David Wallach Fountain by sculptors Frederick C. Hibbard and Elizabeth Hazeltine, and four council rings designed by Caldwell. Landmarks staff determined that Promontory Point meets four criteria for landmarking, including Criterion 1 for heritage. Built as part of Burnham’s ambitious lakefront expansion, Promontory Point was an integral part of the development of new green space in the early 20th century. To create the land, revetments were installed. The process began by driving wood piles into the lake and tying them together with steel bands. The cribs as they called them were filled in with stones and once the site behind it was infilled, cut limestone blocks were set on top of those cribs and up against the new landfill to prevent erosion. After the Great Depression, WPA funds from the New Deal helped fund the completion of Promontory Point and the construction of the pavilion building.   The next criterion is Criterion 4 for exemplary architecture. Alfred Caldwell was tapped to design Promontory Point, where he created a scene of an open meadow framed by irregular groupings of greenery that gave a sense of enclosure and framed views out towards the lake and city. This center space drastically contrasted with the limestone revetments that edged the perimeter. Emmanuel Buchsbaum, who was the Park District’s head architect, designed the pavilion building in a French Eclectic style that was uncommon for the era. The building was designed with a round tower and conical roof at the intersection of two asymmetric gabled roof wings.  The Point also meets Criterion 5 for being the work of significant architects and designers. Alfred Caldwell was a great 20th century landscape designer whose tenure included time at the Chicago Park District where he was quickly given the most ambitious and high-profile projects due to his knowledge and design skills. Emmanuel V. Buchsbaum began his career as a draftsman before he spent almost his entire career at the Chicago Park District except for a few years where he worked on the State Street subway. Frederick C Hibbard and Elizabeth Hazeltine were husband and wife artists who both studied at the School of the Art Institute before working on a wide body of work that extends around the country. The final criterion is Criterion 7 for its unique or distinct visual features. Although landfill created new green space from Grant Park to Jackson Park, Promontory Point is the only peninsula on the lakeshore. From its earliest days, Chicagoans have used it for all kinds of group outings, gatherings, and recreation.  As set forth by the landmarks staff, the designation would protect all exterior elevations and rooflines of the pavilion building, as well as the pathways, council rings, the David Wallach Fountain, and the limestone revetments. Alfred Caldwell’s landscape design of a central meadow edged by irregular groupings of plants and trees would also be included, but routine landscape maintenance would be excluded from review.  With the City Council’s approval, the decades-long fight to landmark and preserve Promontory Point has achieved a major victory. From now on, any proposed work to the point will need a thorough review by landmarks staff, shielding the last remaining limestone revetments from being removed and replaced with steel and concrete like the rest of the lakefront.

Further details outlined for UChicago Cancer Center,"UChicago Medicine has outlined further details of their plans for Chicago’s first free standing cancer center. Planned for a site along W. 57th St between S. Drexel Ave and S. Maryland Ave, the 575,000-square-foot facility will provide patients and the community access to the newest diagnostic innovations and leading-edge therapies. Building a world-class cancer center, the university has tapped CannonDesign to design the eight-story building which will be topped with a mechanical penthouse and set into the ground with a lower-level support floor. The 163-foot-tall building has been designed with a series of curved indentations that increase the facade area to allow for more rooms along the exterior and for daylight to reach further into the building. Made up of glass and metal paneling, the facade’s ribbons change opacity to create movement and flow around the building. The building will include 80 private beds dedicated to patients with cancer, split between 64 medical-surgical and 16 ICU. To accommodate overnight stays, family space will be included. 90 consultation and outpatient exam rooms will be included in the building, while a rapid assessment/urgent care clinic will be provided separately to protect immunocompromised oncology patients from exposure to other patients.

Hyde Park Labs begins vertical construction,"Trammell Crow Company and Beacon Capital Partners recently announced that vertical construction is underway at Hyde Park Labs. Located on the corner of E. 52nd St and S. Harper Ave, the project is next to the UChicago’s Harper Court offices and a few blocks from UChicago’s main Hyde Park campus and the University of Chicago Medical Center.  Designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects and Interactive Design Architects, Hyde Park Labs will rise 14 stories and will include ground-level retail, lobby and loading space, and nine floors of Class A lab and office space measuring 302,388 square feet. Parking will be available on one level of below-grade space, as well as space on floors two to four. Tenants of Hyde Park Labs will have access to nearly 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a fifth-floor terrace dubbed “The Lawn,” which will feature grills, fire pits, views of Lake Michigan and connection to the interior tenant lounge. The building will also offer private terraces on every floor, secure on-site bike storage, an indoor bar and lounge, an executive boardroom, as well as activated ground-floor retail. The developers are pursuing LEED, WELL, & U.S. Green Building Council certifications for the building. Marking the second phase of development at Harper Court, Hyde Park Labs will join a hotel, an office building housing many UChicago administrative offices, and retail space that already exists on the site. The TCC/Beacon development plan and design was crafted to create an innovative life science hub with direct community benefits. The project will strengthen the City of Chicago’s growing life sciences ecosystem, and at the same time create the advanced lab infrastructure needed to support a science and technology hub on the South Side, leveraging its location alongside the University of Chicago. The building is projected to contribute to the vibrancy of the community, adding a significant new workforce in the neighborhood that will help support local retail and restaurants. The University of Chicago has pre-leased one and a half floors of the building totaling 55,000 square feet, a portion of which will house researchers from the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. Space will also be used to develop an incubator program to support startup companies focused on the life sciences. “The University of Chicago is one of the world’s leading academic institutions, renowned for driving innovation across many disciplines, including biosciences and quantum. We’re proud that through the development of Hyde Park Labs, the University will be able to further support the incubation of early and growth stage companies on the cutting edge of scientific and technological discovery,” said Fred Seigel, President and CEO, Beacon Capital Partners. “We’re also excited for our first opportunity to partner with Trammell Crow as we bring this project to life in Chicago.” The development team and the University of Chicago are committed to fostering engagement and inclusion within the advanced science and technology building, including the dedication of 2,500 square feet of community space with programming for STEM students, teaching spaces, and university mentorship. The development team has also committed to funding a Community Engagement Program, which will include an annual community support fund to support STEM programming with local students, in addition to hiring a full-time community engagement coordinator that will operate and manage the community space. The project will also commit greater than 40% of construction and operations spend towards minority and women-owned businesses. With construction in progress, general contractors Power Construction and Ujamaa Construction have teamed up for the project. With demolition and tower crane permits issued, work will go vertical very soon with a completion date set for late 2024. ",Hyde Park,0.0

UChicago Medicine submitted a request to the state regulatory board seeking approval for the design and planned site for the proposed center back in January 2022. After holding a public meeting in February 2022, UChicago Medicine filed a subsequent certificate of need application for construction this past Fall 2022.  The organization expects construction to start in the latter half of 2023 depending on regulatory approval with the cancer center set to open to patients in 2027.  ",Hyde Park,0.0
Harper Court Phase 2 set to kickoff,"Work is set to kick off on the second phase of Harper Courts. Located in Hyde Park, the project site is an irregular shaped lot on the block bound by E. 52nd St to the north, S. Lake Park Ave to the east, E. 53rd St to the south, and S. Harper Ave to the west. With Harper Court bisecting the project, an office building and retail podium has already been built at the southeast corner, with a hotel occupying the slender site along S. Harper Ave bound by S. Harper Court to the north and east. In collaboration with University of Chicago, developers Beacon Capital Partners and Trammell Crow have teamed up to develop the northwest corner of the block. Currently occupied in part by the existing Harper Court Phase 1 retail podium and by the Park 52 restaurant building, the new project will be built on top of the existing retail and will replace the restaurant. With Elkus Manfredi Architects, Interactive Design Architects, and Moody Nolan working together on the design, the project reflects a shifted scope from the earlier proposal. Planned as a world-class research facility, the research lab building will stand 13 floors, encompassing 295,000 square feet of leasable lab space, of which University of Chicago will lease 50,000 square feet. While the previous version called for a taller tower overlooking S. Lake Park Ave, the new scope will allow for larger floor plates for tenants while reducing the height down to 215 feet.  At the ground floor, existing retail space along Harper Court will be retained and built on top of while approximately 4,000 square feet of new retail space will front the northwest corner of the block. The expanded podium will hold 125 new parking stalls while offering a new amenity deck that will stretch over to S. Lake Park Ave. A mechanical floor and parking will separate the ground floor from the upper nine floors of lab space.  The developers have tapped Power Construction and Ujamaa Construction as joint venture partners acting as the general contractor for the project. A permit to demolish the restaurant building has been issued and will be completed by Taylor Excavating and Construction. Work on the new building is set to follow immediately after with a goal for occupancy in Q2 2024. ",Hyde Park,0.0

Plantings and trees have been specifically excluded at this time. The next step for the designation would be a report and final landmark recommendation from the commission which could come as soon as next month. If there are no issues, the City Council could adopt the landmark designation by the end of April. Once the presentation ended, the hearing turned into a heated discussion between city officials and preservationists about the details of the plan for repairing the limestone. Local alderman Leslie Hairston criticized the Park District and CDOT for leaving her out of discussions about next steps for the limestone revetments and for a plan to replace the limestone with concrete that was apparently included in an unreleased document from CDOT and SmithGroup. This document was found out to be the Lakefront Strategic Action Plan that was contracted with SmithGroup back in 2019. Hairston said, “If this [project] is to be done in anything other than limestone, it is a no-go for the community.” Park District and Department of Transportation officials both went on the record in the meeting to say they’re “in complete agreement” with the community and will be pursuing the locally preferred plan. To this Jack Spicer, Founder of Promontory Point Conservancy, criticized that the  “locally preferred plan”  was to demolish the limestone and replace it with concrete which was absolutely not the community’s preferred plan. CDOT Deputy Commissioner Dan Burke who joined the call on short notice pushed back on Spicer’s reference to what was apparently a plan from all the way back in 2005 saying, “Can we stop discussing 2005? Let's put it to rest,"" Burke said. “We’re committed to a plan reusing the existing limestone and doing it as part of a rehabilitation that will be consistent with the Secretary of Interior’s standards for historic preservation.” Park District representative Heather Gleason also reaffirmed their commitment saying, “I understand the community’s fear about it, but I want to be clear: The Chicago Park District, as the property owner of Promontory Point, our intention is to follow the community’s wishes to maintain and preserve the limestone.” Moving on, the commission voted to approve the landmark designation and the meeting ended. With this landmark status moving forward, the ultimate designation would then require any work proposed for Promontory Point to be reviewed by landmarks staff prior to anything being done on the site.    ",Hyde Park,0.0

University of Chicago parking structure lands full building permit,"Full building permits have been issued for the Campus South Multi-Use Facility. Located at 1306 E 61st Street, the new structure will be replacing the site’s existing field house and single-story building at 6047 S. Kimbark Avenue.  Demolition permits for that structure were issued in late August of 2021.  Designed by bKL Architecture, the four-story project will provide 323 parking spots, as well as a parking office, a meeting/community room, and support space for the school’s adjacent athletic fields. Rising 51 feet, the structure will be clad with a rhythmic vertical metal panel that provides a texture to the building volume while allowing for natural ventilation for the parking floors. Per UChicago’s website, the massing of the building will provide a transition from the university campus to the residential district south of 61st Street. The color of the materials was chosen to integrate the building into its context, by drawing from the warm natural color of the limestone found in wall panels and accent stones throughout the community.  The primary vehicle entrance and exit will be on the north side of the parcel, aligned with S Kimbark Avenue which is a vacated street. Cars can also access the parking via E 61st Street. The main pedestrian entrance will be an elevator lobby at the northwest corner, aligning with the Rubenstein Forum and Study Hotel. This project is expected to generate approximately 400 temporary construction jobs over a 10-month period.

New hotel at University of Chicago nears completion,"Construction crews are putting the finishing touches on Hyde Park's new 167-room hotel known as The Study at the University of Chicago. Located just south of the Midway Plaisance at 1227 E. 60th Street, the 13-story building is on track to officially open in October, according to developer and operator Hospitality 3. Designed by local architecture firm Holabird & Root, the soon-to-open South Side hotel will be Study Hotels' third property. The brand currently operates hotels near Yale and Philadelphia’s University City (a fourth location is planned at Johns Hopkins). Hospitality 3 broke ground on the U of C project in early 2020. New renderings shared on the hotel's website provide a sneak peek at the interior spaces as work on the exterior wraps up. The images provide a glimpse of the lobby ""living room"" furnished with an ""eclectic mix of traditional and contemporary furniture with warm fabrics and classic accents,"" as well as the hotel's ""tavern-style"" restaurant and lounge.

The building has 76 apartments with a unit mix of 18 studios, 40 one-beds, and 18 two-bedroom apartments. Units have been drywalled and flooring is beginning in some units. The apartments have been designed with simplicity for accessibility and finishes include high contrast colors to help those who are visually impaired. The fourth floor also holds a community room facing east overlooking an outdoor roof deck for residents. Heading up the building, our next stop was the ninth floor, the top floor of the building. Units have been framed out and insulation has been installed. Our final stop was the roof of the building, which won’t be accessible to residents but offered expansive views of downtown to the northeast and the surrounding neighborhoods to the south and west. The project is funded through the City of Chicago and Low-Income Housing Tax credits. With the land owned by The Chicago Lighthouse, the residents of the building will be able to take advantage of all of the organization’s resources to get on the path to independence and self-sufficiency. With McShane Construction and Ashlaur Construction collaborating on the construction, work is expected to wrap up in late Spring 2024. ",Illinois Medical District,0.0

Crews put finishing touches on Atrio apartments in Illinois Medical District ,"The effort to transform the outdated high-rise at 1926 W. Harrison Street into contemporary apartments is nearing completion in the Illinois Medical District on Chicago's Near West Side. Dubbed Atrio, the project has finished re-cladding the 18-story, 1960s-era Medical Center Apartments by swapping out the existing structure's precast concrete panels for new floor-to-ceiling glass. The renovation work, led by general contractor Focus Construction, is far more than skin deep. The tower's existing 306 residential units were gut-rehabbed into modern 272 rental units offered in studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom layouts. Fifty-two of the apartments are set aside as affordable housing.

Affordable housing approved at 2907 W.

Irving Park. Planned by developers Full Circle Communities and Visionary Ventures, the project will occupy a vacant site that is midblock between N. Richmond St and N. Francisco Ave near Horner Park and the north branch of the Chicago River. Designed by Canopy / architecture + design, the architecture was inspired by native culture, using a metaphor of the river in the design to express the native culture in the project. Topping out at 79 feet tall, the seven-story building has been designed with a serrated facade lined with east-facing balconies. The ground floor has been setback to provide an expanded sidewalk and landscaping and the seventh floor has been setback to reduce the perceived height and mass of the structure. Set to hold 45 units, the building will cluster community with a multigenerational set of apartments ranging from studios to three-beds. Units will be available at a range of incomes from 15-60% AMI. Designed in response to climate and culture, every unit will have an east-facing balcony to orient towards the morning sun and connect to the Chicago River nearby.    The ground floor of the building will face W.

Preliminary landmark approved for Phoebe and John Gray House,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark designation of the Phoebe and John Gray House in Irving Park. Located at 4362 W. Grace, the 1850s home is a two-story wood-frame Italianate-style residence with a third-story cupola.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Gray House represents the Irving Park neighborhood’s early stage as rural farmland in Jefferson Township, prior to annexation by the City of Chicago. The Gray House’s proportions and large corner lot harken back to a time preceding the advent of suburban subdivisions. The juxtaposition of the Gray House with the repeating pattern of standardized house lots that surround it speaks to the development of Chicago’s “railroad suburbs” in the 19th century.  Also meeting Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture, the home is an excellent example of 19th-century mail-order pattern-book architecture, a design and distribution method popularly used in suburban development. It is a great example of residential architecture in the Italianate style, an architectural style of great significance in the history of Chicago and the United States. It possesses numerous features distinctive to the style, including its asymmetric footprint, arcaded porches, arched-header windows, shallow-gabled roofs, overhanging eaves supported by cornice brackets, balustraded balconies, and a three-story tower with cupola. The Gray House also meets the separate Integrity Criterion as it retains its historic overall exterior form and almost all exterior materials, features and detailing. Changes to the Gray House are minor and include the replacement of the original roof shingles with asphalt shingles, the expansion of the original front stoop with a wraparound porch, and minimal window alterations towards the rear of the original house. In 1989 and 2008, the home was expanded by removing portions of the Italianate’s rear wall to accommodate a two-story extension at the far north end of the building. In 2023, the current owners had the house repainted, choosing to replace the yellow exterior with a deep shade of red. Details of the Italianate’s ornamental trim are showcased by the new polychrome paint treatment. The commission staff has recommended that the significant features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building. Excluded from the significant features is the garage at the northeast corner of the lot, which was permitted for construction in 1989. With the preliminary landmark recommendation approved, the building is shielded from demolition. The commission staff will prepare a landmark report before the Commission on Chicago Landmarks votes on a final landmark recommendation that would then send the designation to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.  ",Irving Park,0.0

Three of them will face W. Irving Park Rd with the last retail structure facing N. Kilpatrick Ave. Surface behind the retail buildings will offer 126 spots for commercial customers and a parking lot east of the residential building will have 24 residential visitor spaces. Rising five floors, the large residential building on the southern half of the site will hold 348 rental units, which represents a large increase from 110 units in an earlier plan. A portion of the residential units will be set aside as affordable. Residents will have access to a second-floor amenity deck with an outdoor pool and select units will have balconies. The building’s ground floor will have a large central lobby that faces the surface parking to the north with drop off zones in front of the building. Coworking space and a fitness center will flank the lobby, screening 204 residential parking spaces located within the bulk of the floor from view. 27 duplex apartments will screen the parking from N. Kilpatrick Ave, N. Milwaukee Ave, and the southern elevation facing the nearby existing residential buildings.  The initial scheme for the site, originally presented in 2020, included no residential units and only single-story retail buildings with surface parking. The current revision of the development represents the developer’s response after receiving intense pushback from neighbors and the Department of Planning and Development. While the retail structures don’t have specific tenants announced, Amazon Fresh, the original anchor tenant for the development, will not be part of the project. ",Irving Park,0.0

Alderman supports development at 2907 W. Irving Park,"Alderman Rossana Rodriguez has announced that she will support developers Full Circle Communities and Visionary Ventures plan for an all-affordable residential development at 2907 W. Irving Park. Currently a vacant lot, the property is midblock between N. Richmond St and N. Francisco Ave near Horner Park and the north branch of the Chicago River. Designed by Canopy / architecture + design, the architecture was inspired by native culture, using a metaphor of the river in the design to express the native culture in the project. Topping out at 79 feet tall, the seven-story building has been designed with a serrated facade lined with east-facing balconies. The ground floor has been setback to provide an expanded sidewalk and landscaping and the seventh floor has been setback to reduce the perceived height and mass of the structure. Set to hold 45 units, the building will cluster community with a multigenerational set of apartments ranging from studios to three-beds. Units will be available at a range of incomes from 15-60% AMI. Designed in response to climate and culture, every unit will have an east-facing balcony to orient towards the morning sun and connect to the Chicago River nearby.  The ground floor of the building will face W. Irving Park Rd with the residential lobby, the bike room with 45 spaces, and a commercial space that will be reserved for a Native American non-profit or service organization. Parking for 16 cars will be at the back of the ground floor accessible from the alley. Currently zoned RS-1, the developers need Alderman Rodriguez’s approval to rezone the site to B3-3. In her statement to constituents, Rodriguez cited the significant loss of housing in the neighborhood through demolitions and deconversions, the decline in school population as a result of those demolitions and deconversions, and the provisions of the Connected Communities Ordinance as reasons for supporting the project. The alderman’s office reportedly received over 375 responses to their feedback form with over 73% of respondents in favor of the development.   With aldermanic approval, the rezoning application can head to City Hall to receive approval from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. The development team is planning on wrapping up plans for the building and applying for a permit in Fall 2023, beginning construction in Spring 2024, starting pre-leasing in Winter 2024, and completing construction in Spring 2025.

Alderman rejects residences at DePaul College Prep site,"Alderman Rossanna Rodriguez, of the 33th Ward, has announced to her constituents that she has formally denied the zoning change request to redevelop the former DePaul College Prep campus. Located along the North Branch of the Chicago River, the site reaches from W Addison St to W Grace St along N California Ave.  The proposal, submitted by Lexington Homes, would have replaced the 7.3-acre school site with 357 residential units. The plan called for a mix of rental and for-sale dwellings, with 88 townhomes on the northern portion of the site and a six-story mixed-use building at the intersection of W Addison St. and N California Ave.  With a design by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the 70-foot-tall building would have featured 3,000 square feet of retail space along W Addison St and 269 units on the upper floors. The plan would have included 391 parking spaces as well as a new portion of landscaped riverwalk that would connect to the Riverview Bridge.  According to a statement from the alderman, community members expressed strong opposition to the proposal during the process of soliciting feedback in the alderman’s Community Driven Zoning and Development (CDZD) process. The alderman stated that the developer offered to make changes to their proposal, however said changes were supposed to be submitted in November and those modifications have not been submitted to this date. The alderman noted that a majority of the ward’s neighbor-led organizations in the area of the site have also expressed opposition to this project due to its height, significant density, a design that does not fit the current character of its surroundings, its obstruction to access to the river and current public space, and its obstruction to current green space, among other concerns. According to the release, the community has clearly expressed that they would strongly prefer a development project that preserves open green space, with an environmental focus that can better serve the community.

Work on the '312 RiverRun' trail officially complete,"On the banks of the north branch of the Chicago River, city officials gathered to cut the ribbon on a new underbridge bike and pedestrian path beneath Irving Park Road. The project represents the last piece of the ""312 RiverRun"" trail system stretching 1.5 miles from Montrose to Belmont Avenue. The centerpiece of the network is the 1,010-foot-long Riverview Bridge, which was completed in 2019. The new underbridge pathway at Irving Park Road creates a car-free connection between Horner Park to the north to California and Clark Parks to the south. The $18.1 million project also replaced and widened the 100-year-old bridge structure, which carries an average of 34,500 vehicles a day, according to the city. A combination of local, state, and federal sources, including the Federal Highway Administration and the Illinois Department of Transportation, funded construction. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard,  Illinois EPA, and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources were also involved in the project. ""[312 RiverRun] is a great example of the kind of infrastructure projects our communities need, as they improve our parks and transportation systems to make it easier for our residents to exercise and enjoy the outdoors,"" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a statement Friday.  The 312 RiverRun trail system serves several North Side neighborhoods, including Irving Park, North Center, Avondale, and Albany Park. Construction on the project kicked off in fall 2017, during the administration of then-mayor Rahm Emanuel.  ",Irving Park,0.0
Revealed: 357 homes for former DePaul College Prep site,"Developer Lexington Homes has revealed new renderings of its plan to redevelop the former DePaul College Prep campus in Irving Park into townhomes and a six-story apartment building. If approved, the project would completely transform the 7.3-acre riverfront parcel at the northeast corner of California Avenue and Addison Street. Designed by Chicago-based architecture firm Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the complex includes 269 rental units (96 studios, 138 one-beds, 49 two-beds, and 74 three-bedrooms) with monthly rents ranging from $1,399 to $2,900. The project's 88 for-sale townhomes feature two- and three-bedroom floorplans priced between $599,000 and $800,000. Ten percent of the units will be set aside as affordable housing to comply with city regulations.  The development also calls for 2,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space at the corner of California and Addison plus on-site parking for 391 cars and 50 bicycles. A proposed landscaped riverwalk would connect to the nearby Riverview Bridge—a 1,000-foot-long waterfront pedestrian and bike trail completed in 2019. Lexington filed a zoning application for the Irving Park project in June and is now in the outreach phase of the 33rd Ward's community-driven zoning and development (CDZD) process. ""This proposal will not move forward to a city hearing without first completing a full CDZD process and receiving the alderwoman’s recommendation, which will not be made without community input,"" said Ald. Rossana Rodriguez in a recent email to 33rd Ward residents.  While the development team is expected to announce a community-wide public meeting to discuss the project this fall, some residents, such as the California Park Neighborhood Association, have already taken a firm stand against Lexington's proposal. The 33rd Ward office is currently accepting public feedback regarding the development online. The 357-unit project will require a zoning change from the city as well as a Residential-Waterway Planned Development due to the site's proximity to the north branch of the Chicago River. DePaul College Prep announced in mid-2019 that it would close its Irving Park location and move to a new campus in Roscoe Village.

357 residences pitched for Irving Park's old DePaul College Prep campus,"Lexington Homes has submitted paperwork with the city to redevelop the former DePaul College Prep campus at the northeast corner of California Avenue and Addison Street in Irving Park. If approved, the plan would bring 357 residences to the 7.3-acre riverfront parcel.  DePaul College Prep announced in mid-2019 that it would move to a new campus in Roscoe Village. The Catholic high school's land, which is owned by the Congregation of the Resurrection, hit the market later that year, Crain's reported. Lexington's proposal calls for a mix of rental and for-sale residences comprising 88 townhouses at the north portion of the site and a six-story, multi-family building with 269 units and 3,000 square feet of commercial space at the property's southern edge. Pappageorge Haymes Partners is listed as the project's design architect.  The plan would also include 391 parking spaces and a landscaped riverwalk connecting to the Riverview Bridge, a 1,000-foot-long pedestrian and bike connection completed in 2019. The development team will seek a zoning change and a Residential-Waterway Planned Development application due to the site's location along the north branch of the Chicago River.  The city’s current Affordable Requirements Ordinance requires the developer to set aside 10 percent affordable housing. Lexington “has agreed to satisfy its affordable housing obligation by providing a combination of in-lieu payments and required affordable units in the rental/for sale buildings,” according to the zoning application.  The proposal will need to navigate the Community Driven Zoning and Development (CDZD) process put in place by Ald. Rossana Rodriguez (33rd). The alderperson’s zoning and economic development manager was not immediately available for comment on the project, and no community meetings have been scheduled, according to the 33rd Ward website.

Jefferson Park mixed-income rentals score first permit,"The first of two mixed-income apartment buildings slated for a long-vacant lot at 6001 W. Lawrence Avenue in Jefferson Park has scored a construction permit. Known as Lawrence & Austin Apartments, the project from nonprofit developer Full Circle Communities aims to address the shortfall of affordable housing for veterans, people with disabilities, seniors, and families on the city's far Northwest Side. Designed by Chicago-based Canopy Architecture + Design, the newly permitted building will rise four stories and contain 26 rental units. A second four-story building with 22 apartments is planned next door. The complex will include amenities such as community rooms, laundry facilities, a computer lab and library, a children’s activity room, and bike storage. A landscaped plaza with seating and grilling areas will be located between the two structures, and a total of 34 parking spaces will be provided at the rear of the site. The buildings will be clad earthy tones such as rose and green as ""a nod to the Illinois prairie landscape,"" according to Canopy's designers. The estimated $20 million project does not rely on city funding but will take advantage of $1.5 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credits from the Illinois Housing Development Authority. The permit estimates the scope of the work on the first building at roughly $6.9 million and lists Henry Bros. Co. as the general contractor. The upcoming development is moving forward despite opposition from Ald. Nick Sposato (38th), who claimed the plan was too dense and included too few parking spaces, according to WTTW Chicago. The city's Committee on Zoning ultimately rejected Sposato's efforts to block the Lawrence & Austin Apartments and voted in favor of the project last fall.   The Lawrence and Austin buildings represent the second mixed-income housing development in Jefferson Park from Full Circle Communities. Earlier this year, the developer completed a seven-story complex with 15 market-rate and 60 affordable apartments at 5150 Northwest Highway. Despite also facing fierce opposition from NIMBY groups, the Northwest Side project received more than 700 applications for its 75 residences, reported Block Club Chicago.  ",Jefferson Park,0.0
Jefferson Park condo plan fails to impress alderman,"The local alderman in Jefferson Park has asked the developer behind a low-rise condominium proposal to redesign their plans for a second time after their latest plan received complaints from community members.  Hudson Construction Services initially proposed a four-story project with a total of 24 units for the former United Methodist Church at 5850 N. Elston Avenue on Chicago's northwest side. Although the scope of the development was later reduced to a three-story complex with 18 for-sale units and 24 parking spaces, neighbors were still unsatisfied. At an in-person community meeting hosted last week by Ald. James Gardiner (45th), residents railed against the revised proposal, calling it too dense, too tall, and not providing enough on-site parking. More than 50 people attended the meeting yet only one individual spoke in favor of the development, according to Block Club Chicago. On Friday, Ald. Gardiner said in his newsletter that he will not support the latest plan and has requested the developers to go back to the drawing board. ""Based on community feedback, I have asked the developer for 5850 N. Elston to submit another proposal that will be more accepting from residents of our community,"" said Gardiner. ""Stay tuned."" The development team sought a zoning change from RS-3 to a B2-2, which would require Gardiner's support. The 24,500-square-foot property at 5850 N. Elston has been up for sale for over a year. The United Methodist Church shut down its Jefferson Park facility after merging with another church. ",Jefferson Park,0.0
Developer pitches 18 condos in Jefferson Park,"Hudson Construction Services plans to redevelop 5850 N. Elston Avenue into a trio of condominium buildings with six residences each. The site is currently home to the Elston Avenue United Methodist Church, which put their 24,500-square-foot Jefferson Park property up for sale after merging with another church.  The team initially proposed a four-story project with a total of 24 units for the site, but that design was met with backlash. The team presented a quick glimpse at the revised plans at a virtual meeting held Monday evening by Ald. James Gardiner (45th).  ""There was community concern due to the height and how many residents would be living there,"" said Gardiner on Monday. ""After some discussion with the developer he is now seeking a zoning change from RS-3 to a B2-2 instead of a B2-3.""  Designed by architect Richard Rasmussen, the scaled-back development now calls for three 3-story buildings rising roughly 38 feet. Each structure would contain two units per floor: the ground floor (and lower level) would contain ""duplex-down"" condos with three bedrooms plus a flex room, while the second and third floors each house a pair of two-bedroom residences. ""We've designed large front outdoor spaces for each of the units, that are approximately 160 square feet,"" said developer Michelangelo Siracki. ""Due to the new COVID realities about living and working from home, we wanted to be sure that every unit had ample outdoor space that was covered."" The proposal includes 24 rear parking spaces as well as a small private pocket park along Mamora Avenue. Unfortunately due to an unforeseen technical snafu, the development team was not able to share their screen during the presentation and resorted to holding up a tablet displaying renderings of the project. After several frustrating minutes, Ald. Gardiner cut the meeting short saying his office would instead host an in-person community gathering at a later date to be determined.   Monday's abridged presentation did include a brief Q&A period allowing a handful of neighbors an opportunity to complain. Comments included concerns over the project's height (still?) and a perceived lack of parking. One resident expressed fear that a zoning change for one development could somehow set off a runaway ""chain reaction"" of up-zoning across the entire neighborhood.  Stay tuned for more.  ",Jefferson Park,0.0
Controversial mixed-income housing project nears completion in Jefferson Park,"After enduring controversy that included a lawsuit from local NIMBYs, an upcoming mixed-income housing project is entering the home stretch at 5150 Northwest Highway in Jefferson Park. The seven-story complex from nonprofit developer Full Circle Communities and architect Cordogan, Clark & Associates broke ground in 2019 and has reached its final height at the intersection of Northwest Highway and Milwaukee Avenue.  The building will soon deliver 15 market-rate and 60 affordable apartments offered in studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom floorplans. One-hundred percent of the units will be prioritized for veterans and persons with a disability, according to the development team. The plan also includes parking for 40 cars and 5,500 square feet of commercial space that will be leased by nonprofit Friendship Community Place for offices and space for community events. Despite its proximity to mass transit, the Jefferson Park neighborhood has seen few multifamily developments in recent years. The Northwest Highway project received considerable pushback from some community members and was arguably a contributing factor in former Ald. John Arena losing reelection. In 2017 Arena responded to a lawsuit filed against him and the city by residents unhappy with the plan. ""We won't be bullied or discouraged from fighting for safe, accessible, reasonably priced housing for people with disabilities and those who bravely served our nation,"" he wrote on Facebook.  The apartments at 5150 Northwest Highway are currently on track to open later this year.

Requesting $250,000 in Adopt-A-Landmark funds for the stained-glass window restoration, the overall restoration work will total $431,000. The restoration work comes as part of a larger investment in the building totaling approximately $2.1 million for exterior and roof work. For restoring the stained-glass windows, all of the vents will have their rusted surfaces ground smooth and reprimed with fresh paint. The glass panes will be cleaned and repaired where needed. On the exterior, all window protection glass will be removed and replaced with new plate glass fit to the exterior frames.  With JLK Architects on board, the project’s costs break down into $266,000 for restoration work, $75,000 for construction materials, $38,000 for scaffolding, and approximately $50,000 for general conditions and soft costs.  With approval from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the congregation can move forward with restoration work for the windows.

Muddy Waters house renovations get city funding,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved the Adopt-A-Landmark application for the Muddy Water House. Located at 4339 S Lake Park Avenue in North Kenwood, City Council approved its landmark status back in October 2021. Built in 1891, the brick two-flat sits on a traditional Chicago residential lot and is site midblock between E 43rd Street and E 44th Street. It was home to Muddy Waters between 1954 and 1973. Conditionally awarded the funding in December 2021, the money will go towards the renovation of the home into a museum dedicated to telling the story of Muddy Waters. Owned by Shandra Cooper, the project is expected to cost $267,000 for phase one of the project. The approved Adopt-A-Landmark grant will cover $250,000 of those costs.   With Bauer Latoza Studio as the architect, the house museum will need an extensive list of repairs and renovations before it can open to the public. Work will include repointing the face brick, cleaning paint, replacing the turret funnel, working on the bay window, adding a new entry door on the back of the house, repairing the main front door, and installing new storm doors that will be replicas of the ones that existed while Muddy Waters lived there. Work is expected to begin once funding is secured and finalized, with a projected starting time frame of Summer 2022.

Work underway on 43rd Street pedestrian bridge ,"Construction is ramping up on a new pedestrian bridge crossing Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central rail tracks at 43rd Street. When complete in late 2022, it will provide a fully-accessible connection for South Side residents to get to and from the Chicago Lakefront Trail, Burnham Park, and nearby beaches. Preparation work has been underway on both sides of Lake Shore Drive since January, and an existing overpass will soon be demolished to make way for the curving, snake-like pathway. If the S-shaped design and arching blue supports in the renderings look familiar, it's because the city completed a similar bridge at nearby 41st street in late 2018. Local architect Cordogan Clark & Associates designed both projects in collaboration with engineering firm AECOM.  Like its sibling to the north, the upcoming 43rd Street connection will feature ADA-compliant ramps to serve pedestrians, cyclists, residents with disabilities, as well as emergency vehicles. According to the Chicago Department of Transportation, the 43rd Street playlot in Burnham Park will also be replaced with a new playground as part of the project's estimated $31.5 million price tag.

Caisson permit issued for Parcel O at Lakeshore East,"A caisson permit has been issued for Parcel O, a mixed-use tower in Lakeshore East. Addressed at 193 N. Columbus, the development is being led by Magellan Development Group and will occupy a vacant parcel within the Lakeshore East masterplan. Designed by bKL Architecture, the development underwent a redesign in 2021 which saw the scope of the building revised to contain only one hotel with 269 keys rather than two hotels with 570 keys. The developer had also reduced the number of apartment units from 640 to approximately 629 apartment units. The redesign also includes three levels of co-working space and two retail spaces in the building, including an approximately 5,500-square-foot retail space adjacent to Upper Columbus Drive and an approximately 3,500-square-foot retail space adjacent to North Park Drive. As a result of these revisions to the program of the building, there are also reductions in the building height and the overall square footage for the building. The revised height of the 47-story building will be 502 feet. Permit filings show a slightly revised scope, with the hotel key count down to 239 from 269 and the residential unit count down to 607 from 629. Residents will have access to 25 parking spaces on one of the lower floors, with hotel conference space and residential amenities also in the lower levels between N. Columbus Dr and N. Park Dr. The massing of the building has been designed with a sawtooth plan that creates dynamic movement along the façade and strong vertical lines that pull the eye up to the building’s crown. The facade’s articulation reverses direction between the residential and hotel floors, highlighting the change in program. The tower massing is pushed to the eastern side of the site, allowing for a base that is more in scale with the adjacent buildings on the park. The project originally received approval from the Chicago Plan Commission in 2018 and planned to begin construction back in 2021 after receiving site plan approval for the revised design. With the caisson permit issued, general contractor Power Construction can begin work on the new building. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Lakeshore East,0.0

Cirrus-exclusive amenities include a coworking lounge with conference rooms and a resort-style outdoor pool with an adjacent lounge. On the 41st floor is a wine tasting room, separate show and prep kitchens with dining area and chef’s corner lounge, and outdoor terrace with grilling stations and a fire pit – all overlooking breathtaking views of Lake Michigan and the city skyline. Beyond the building, Cirrus also offers direct access to Cascade Park, the 0.8-acre green space created for both residents and the public. Designed by Claude Cormier + Associés, whose vision was executed by Confluence, the park features lush landscaping, passive wellness features, meandering pathways, outdoor living rooms for recreational use, terrace seating and a dog run. As part of the overall vision for the development, Cascade Park established a significantly improved connection between the Lakeshore East neighborhood and the lakefront with its terraced landscape design that slopes from North Harbor Drive to Lower Lake Shore Drive and a new bike and walking path that connects Lakeshore East Park in the heart of the neighborhood to the Lakefront Trail. Cirrus condominiums include 12 different one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans ranging in size from 650 to nearly 3,000 square feet and priced from the mid-$400,000s to $2.9 million. Floors 42-47 feature two-, three- and four-bedroom penthouse homes, including one duplex, ranging from 1,558 to 3,695 square feet and priced from $1.8 million to $5 million. Two townhome residences measuring more than 3,000 square feet are located at ground level and priced from $1.8 million. Views in each unit are enhanced by floor-to-ceiling windows and 9-foot ceilings, and all include laundry rooms, walk-in closets with custom organizer systems, wide-plank flooring and keyless entry. Many also have private balconies. Prospective buyers can view six models showcasing the high-end finishes all homes at Cirrus will feature. Kitchens include best-in-class Snaidero cabinetry, quartzite countertops and decorative tile backsplashes; Gaggenau wall ovens, speed ovens and gas cooktops; Bosch built-in recirculating hoods; Gaggenau integrated refrigerators; Bosch integrated dishwashers; Dornbracht faucets; and Franke stainless steel undermount sinks with disposal. Snaidero cabinetry, quartzite countertops, Dornbracht faucets, walk-in showers with frameless glass doors, frameless wall-mounted illuminated mirrors with medicine cabinets, and porcelain tile on floors and walls bring a spa-like quality to the primary and secondary baths. In accordance with Lendlease’s global commitment to sustainability, health and wellness, the development partners are on track to obtain LEED Gold and Fitwel certifications for both Cirrus and Cascade.

Photos: Cascade Park opens in Lakeshore East,"Work is complete on Cascade Park, a privately developed but publicly accessible open space improvement in downtown's Lakeshore East neighborhood. The new landscaping slopes downward nearly 50 feet from North Harbor Drive to the west to form a ground-level connection to Lower Lake Shore Drive and the Chicago Lakefront Trail to the east. Magellan Development and Lendlease broke ground on the 0.8-acre green space alongside a pair of adjacent residential towers in mid-2019. Montreal-based landscape architects Claude Cormier + Associes designed the park with a series of ADA-accessible sidewalk switchbacks that frame flattened lawns which can be used for recreational activities and social gatherings. There are also ""passive wellness sculptures,"" composed of limestone and wood blocks that double as seating.  Cascade Park sits atop a ramp-like reinforced concrete structure and geofoam blocks—a lightweight material used in other recent landscape projects in Chicago, including nearby Maggie Daley Park and Bennett Park. Beneath the elevated green space, improved bike and walking paths link Lakeshore East Park to the Lakefront Trail and DuSable Harbor. A dog-friendly area at the base of the slope—dubbed ""Cascade Bark""—is still receiving its finishing touches.  According to a statement from Lendlease, the project represents ""a significant aesthetic and functional improvement to the neighborhood's connection to the lakefront."" The new connection between Lakeshore East and the lakefront replaces what the developer described as a ""nondescript concrete maze of lower-level sidewalks and service drives."" The opening of Cascade Park also coincides with the first move-ins at the 37-story Cascade apartment tower at nearby 455 E. Waterside Drive. The building from Magellan, Lendlease, and bKL Architecture features 503 rental units and 45,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenity space. Monthly rents in the newly opened tower start at $1,650 per month for a studio, $2,050 for a one-bedroom, $3,300 for a two-bedroom, and $5,750 per month for a three-bedroom unit. Cascade's sibling, a 47-story condominium building, known as Cirrus, is on track to welcome residents to its 350 for-sale units this fall. Magellan and Lendlease also have city approval to build a third residential tower on Lakeshore East's vacant ""Parcel I"" to the immediate north. It's unclear when the team intends to break ground on the 85-story, 950-foot-tall skyscraper.   ",Lakeshore East,0.0
New renderings: Lakeshore East's Cascade apartments begin pre-leasing,"As construction crews put the finishing touches on the exterior of Cascade, the team behind the upcoming Lakeshore East apartment tower has released a fresh batch of renderings to lure potential tenants.  Lendlease and Magellan Development announced the start of pre-leasing this week and expect renters to begin moving into the 37-story high-rise at 455 E. Waterside Drive this summer. The building features 503 apartments spanning 509 to 1,332 square feet. Rents start at $1,650 per month for a studio, $2,050 for a one-bedroom, $3,300 for a two-bedroom, and $5,750 per month for a three-bedroom unit. Residents at Cascade will have access to 45,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenity space including a lake-facing fitness center, an outdoor pool, an indoor pool, a screening room, a golf simulator, a game room, a children’s playroom, and a dedicated ""jam room"" with communal musical instruments. A terrace of the tower's 32nd floor features views of Navy Pier and Lake Michigan plus a TV lounge with a chef's kitchen and a study corner with private work pods. Closer to the ground, residents can access an indoor garden dubbed ""the conservatory."" The 900-square-foot space includes seating overlooking Cascade Park: a sloping landscaped publicly accessible pedestrian connection that will bridge Harbor Drive, Lower Lake Shore Drive, and the Lakefront Trail. The new park is on track to also open this summer alongside the apartment building. Cascade's sibling tower, an adjacent 47-story, 350-unit condominium building known as Cirrus, will open a little later and welcome residents this fall. The projects' developers are offering a program that allows residents to sign a contract for a condo at Cirrus and rent next door at Cascade as they wait for their residence to be completed. Half of the rent paid (up to 2.5 percent of the purchase price) can be recouped as a credit at closing. ""The program has been very well-received by the market, as it gives renters the opportunity to build equity in their future home and, when they are ready, seamlessly transition to ownership without uprooting their lives,"" said Lendlease's Ted Weldon in a news release. Lendlease is currently offering a similar rent-to-own arrangement in its multi-building Southbank development along the south branch of the Chicago River. ",Lakeshore East,0.0
Exterior work nearly complete on Lakeshore East's Cirrus and Cascade towers,"In Lakeshore East, Magellan Development and Lendlease are putting the final touches on a pair of new residential high-rises known as Cirrus and Cascade.  The developers broke ground on the downtown towers in mid-2019 and worked through the pandemic to top off both structures in January of this year. Crews are currently wrapping up glass installation, interior build-out, and the project's publicly accessible green space known as ""Cascade Park."" Cirrus, the taller of the two towers, rises 47 stories at 211 N. Harbor Drive. It contains 350 condominiums offered in one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom floorplans ranging from 650 to over 3,000 square feet in size. Pricing starts in the mid-$400,000 range and can exceed $4 million for penthouse units. Cirrus will welcome residents this fall. The neighboring 37-story Cascade building at 455 E. Waterside Drive will contain 503 rental apartments in studio, one-, two, and three-bedroom layouts. Pre-leasing in the shorter tower is set to begin in the coming weeks with the first move-ins expected this summer. Both Cirrus and Cascade were designed by Lakeshore East-based bKL Architecture and feature glassy exteriors with vertical bronze and copper-colored metal accents. The towers sit atop a shared parking podium that is mostly concealed behind the elevated roadways of Lake Shore Drive and Harbor Drive.  Cascade Park is expected to open ahead of schedule this summer. Designed by Montreal landscape architects Claude Cormier + Associes, the 0.8-acre public amenity will provide a sloping pedestrian connection between Harbor Drive, Lower Lake Shore Drive, and the Lakefront Trail. Cirrus and Cascade are among the final buildings in the Lakeshore East masterplan. The duo will eventually be joined by a third bKL-designed residential skyscraper to the immediate north at ""Parcel I,"" although it's unclear when developers plan to break ground on the 85-story, 950-foot-tall tower. The final piece of the LSE puzzle is the ""Parcel O"" building slated for 193 N. Columbus Drive. Also developed by Magellan and designed by bKL, the roughly 500-foot high-rise will contain 629 residential units and 269 hotel rooms. The Parcel O project will break ground no sooner than October 2021, according to Ald. Brendan Reilly. ",Lakeshore East,0.0

Covent Hotel redevelopment celebrates ribbon cutting,"The NHP Foundation recently celebrated the reopening of the Covent Apartments, the company’s latest SRO development. Located at 2653 N. Clark, the project rehabbed the existing Covent Hotel building into 30 small affordable studio apartments. ""Being able to restore this extraordinary space and provide the only permanent supportive housing in Lincoln Park enables individuals in the most dire circumstances to have an affordable home,"" said Covent lead developer Veronica Gonzalez, ""And with the support of our public and private partners here with us today, we prevent displacement from a higher end, upscale community and maintain the character of the community. We congratulate our tax credit investor R4 Capital, and our lender Merchants Capital for their partnership in completing this important project."" Designed by Weese Langley Weese Architects, the historic building will front N. Clark St with 4,700 square feet of retail space and a new residential lobby. Residents will have access to an on-site laundry room, a community room, and outdoor space. The building will have no parking spaces. With a total development cost of $21.6 million, the developer funded the project with $7.9 million in federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and Historic Tax Credits, $5 million of City Home and Affordable Housing Opportunity Funds, $3.1 million in IHDA Permanent Supportive Housing Funds, and $4.9 million of a HUD/FHA 220 loan. The project also received a $698,910 Affordable Housing Program (""AHP"") General Fund grant from FHLBank Chicago. Linn-Mathes was the general contractor leading construction of the development.

Urbanize tours 935 W. Webster,"Urbanize recently toured the construction site of 935 W. Webster, a mixed-use development in Lincoln Park. Planned by Mavrek Development and GW Properties, the property was formerly home to State Restaurant at the southwest corner of W. Webster Ave and N. Bissell St. Starting on the ground floor, the development retained the outside brick walls of the existing one-story building and were painted white. The interior was demolished starting back in March, with a new steel structure built up for the apartments above. With two retail spaces in the building, the western space is leased to Sushi Taku while the corner retail space is still available for lease. Both spaces are enclosed but sit raw awaiting the buildout of the upcoming retailers. The back of the ground floor will include two parking spaces for residents and a bike storage room. Heading up to the apartments, we started with the first two units which are accessed from N. Bissell St. With a total of four units, all of them will be four-bedroom, two-bath configurations. The unique two-floor design brings 20-foot ceilings into the units' common spaces with two bedrooms and one bathroom per floor in the apartments. Flooring and drywall have been installed in the apartments and they are awaiting cabinetry installation before final finishes are installed.  Our next stop was the second set of units, which are accessed from W. Webster Ave. The two units are completed to a similar point, awaiting cabinetry and finishes. Stepping outside, each apartment will have an outdoor deck facing west towards the L tracks. Once completed, the patios will be enclosed with fencing and ivy will be added for additional privacy. On the way out, our final stop was the newly painted mural on the west elevation of the building underneath the L tracks. Construction on the building will wrap up at the end of January 2024 with leasing starting in the New Year. Mavrek is serving as the general contractor with 360 Design Studio serving as the architect. ",Lincoln Park,0.0
DePaul University gets permit to renovate Sullivan Athletic Center,"DePaul University has received permits to renovate the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena at 2323 N. Sheffield. As part of a larger athletics investment, the school is also looking to build a new practice facility for the school’s basketball teams.  Designed by Antunovich Associates and HNTB, the renovation will infill one of the three basketball courts with two stories of new athletic support space. The first floor of the facility will be dedicated to the health and wellness of all 215+ DePaul student athletes, and will include a team dining space, nutrition bar, new sports medicine treatment spaces and offices, hydrotherapy, a weight room, and multi-purpose meeting rooms. Across the street, the school is planning to clear the site of a series of vintage buildings to build a new basketball practice facility. The new facility would feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. DePaul men’s and women’s basketball will move their training, practices, and operations into the building to allow for more dedicated spaces to support the programs.  With the permits issued for renovation, general contractor Bulley & Andrews can begin work inside the building. Work is set to begin this December, with the first phase being completed in late Summer 2024.  As the project moves forward, the demolition of buildings on the site across the street would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest as the proposal is seeking an amendment to the existing Planned Development for the campus. The amendment would need approval from Alderman Timmy Knudsen (43rd), the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council. Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026.  ",Lincoln Park,0.0
DePaul University presents basketball practice facility to community,"DePaul University has presented their plans to renovate the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena as well as to build a new practice facility for the school’s basketball teams. Planned for the northwest corner of W. Belden Ave and N. Sheffield Ave, the new facility will rise across the street from the current Sullivan Athletic Center and will replace a recently acquired, university-owned apartment complex in addition to four other smaller buildings in this area that are from the 1890s and 1920s. At the community meeting, DeWayne Peevy, DePaul’s Vice President and Director of Athletics, walked the community through their current facilities and its shortcomings. Peevy discussed how the current state of disrepair is hindering the school’s ability to recruit and retain top talent, with student athletes opting for other schools with better training programs and facilities. He told community members how this facilities investment was an opportunity for change and to build the national recognition and relevance of DePaul University. Designed by HNTB and Antunovich Associates, the new facility would feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. DePaul men’s and women’s basketball will move their training, practices, and operations across the street from the Sullivan Athletics Center to allow for more dedicated spaces to support the programs.  At the McGrath-Phillips Arena, the renovation will infill one of the three basketball courts with two stories of new athletic support space. The first floor of the facility will be dedicated to the health and wellness of all 215+ DePaul student athletes, and will include a team dining space, nutrition bar, new sports medicine treatment spaces and offices, hydrotherapy, a weight room, and multi-purpose meeting rooms. Set to cost $60 million, the project will be funded primarily through donor gifts and via a fundraising campaign. As the project moves forward, the demolition of buildings on site would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest as the proposal is seeking an amendment to the existing Planned Development for the campus. The amendment would need approval from Alderman Timmy Knudsen (43rd), the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council.  Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026. Renovation of the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena is set to begin this December, with the first phase being completed in late Summer 2024. At the meeting, neighbors expressed concern and disappointment with the plan to demolish the century-old buildings, citing the loss of character within the neighborhood and the loss of student housing. Richard Wiltse, Vice President of Facility Operations at DePaul explained that, while the demolitions will result in the loss of 40 beds of student housing, the school has seen an enrollment decline and there are currently 79 unoccupied beds in student housing. A number of residents made comments and asked about building the facility on other parcels owned by DePaul, including the large parking lot at the northwest corner of W. Fullerton Ave and N. Sheffield Ave or the building at the southeast corner of the same intersection which used to house the Whole Foods. Peter Coffey, Associate Vice President of Community and Government Relations explained that those properties are already master planned, and the university is not willing to give up those redevelopment opportunities which include a potential mixed-use development on the existing surface parking lot with student housing, a hotel, conference center, and parking.  When neighbors suggested replacing the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena, DeWayne Peevy jumped in to explain how it would be impossible to decommission their only athletic space in the interim while construction would be underway.  ",Lincoln Park,0.0

Rezoning proposed for three-flat at 2515 N. Clybourn,"A zoning application has been submitted for a residential development at 2515 N. Clybourn. Planned by owner Sean Gibbons, the project site is a narrow parcel just off of the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and W. Terra Cotta Pl. With Jonathan Splitt Architects leading the design, the new construction will be a three-story masonry building with basement. With three residential units, the basement simplex will have two bedrooms, the first-floor simplex unit will have two bedrooms, and the top two floors will have a three-bedroom duplex apartment. The building will have balconies on the first through third floors and residents will have access to three parking spaces at the back of the property. To allow for the scope of the development, the site will need to be rezoned from M1-2 to RM-4.5. Alderman Waguespack will need to approve the rezoning before it heads to City Hall for approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. ",Lincoln Park,0.0
Sterling Bay presents 1840 N. Marcey to the community,"Sterling Bay has presented their proposal for two mixed-use towers at 1840 N. Marcey. Located near Lincoln Yards, the project site is across the street from the former General Iron site. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the property is a long, rectangular site bound by N. Clifton Ave to the north, N. Kingsbury St to the west, N. Marcey St to the east, and W. Wisconsin St to the south.   Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the project’s design inspiration is based on the industrial history of the area, the Chicago city grid, and the rippling effect of water. The building massings began with a contextual base surrounded by open space, with stepped building masses that were extruded from the bases. The towers were offset to optimize sunlight for active terraces and to create better views for each building. Rising 215 feet, the southern building will be a 16-story tower with 308 residential units. The building will have 98 parking spaces all located on one level of underground parking as well as 308 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. The building’s ground floor features retail at the south end; a fitness center, lounge, and residential lobby at the center overlooking the green space; and leasing offices and the bike room at the north end.  Set to reach 325 feet tall, the 26-story northern building will have 300 rental units and 262 parking spaces, with 55 of them below-grade. Residents will also have access to 300 bike parking spaces. The building’s ground floor will be made up of a significant amount of retail, occupying the entire north and west frontage, only interrupted by the parking access along N. Kingsbury St. The building’s lobby will face south towards the green space, with more retail at the southeast corner.  The two buildings are separated on the site with an internal vehicle driveway and turnaround for drop off and parking access for the southern building. Around the site, the development will widen the sidewalks and stamped crosswalks with improved ADA ramps will be added at the intersections of Clifton/Macey, Clifton/Clybourn, Wisconsin/Marcey, and Wisconsin/Kingsbury. A new traffic signal with pedestrian countdowns and improved ADA ramps are planned for the intersection of Wisconsin/Clybourn. During the meeting a number of residents were concerned about traffic and congestion in the area and how the development would exacerbate the situation. The project site is within a half mile of the Armitage CTA L stop, the North/Clybourn CTA L stop, and the Metra Clybourn stop. Several bus routes are located within walking distance, there are bike lanes on W. Cortland St and N. Clybourn Ave, and there are several Divvy stations nearby. All of these nearby assets will help reduce car traffic generated by the project.  Sterling Bay plans to include 92 units of affordable housing in the project and pay a fee in-lieu of $4.5 million. The project will pay $3.6 million as a North Branch Corridor Bonus Fee and $1.15 million in North Branch Industrial Conversion Fee. The development team told neighbors that they have yet to secure financing for the development. With some neighbors opposed and some in support of the development, Sterling Bay will continue to work with the Department of Planning and Development and Alderman Waguespack’s office to fine tune the development before seeking official approvals from the city.

Full building permit issued for 438 W. Saint James,"A full building permit has been issued for a residential development at 438 W. Saint James Pl. While the project will not rezone its site or establish Planned Development, the project received a Lakefront Protection Ordinance approval due to its proximity to the lakefront. Located within Lincoln Park, the site is a few blocks north of W. Fullerton Ave and is between N. Clark St and Lincoln Park itself.  Planned by Genna Hill via St. James Interests LLC, the revised project will redevelop the site with a five-story building, down from a ten-story building that was originally planned. Occupying a parcel just 33 feet wide, the new building will host a mere four residential units. The ground floor of the building will provide 5 interior parking spaces. Rising 67 feet tall, architects Hirsch MPG have swapped out the contemporary glassy design for a more modest, brick-clad design. With such a narrow building surrounded on three sides, the street frontage has been setback and will include the residential entry to the west, the parking garage entry in the center, and the second egress exit door to the east side.  While the original 10-story building was approved back in May 2022, the developer decided to scale back the project after talking with neighbors and realizing how difficult it would be to build on the thin site, having to deal with a tower crane and associated logistics for the tiny site. The scaled back building will now be able to be built with wood construction and masonry on the outside, simplifying the construction process. With the caisson permit issued in August, the issuance of the full building permit will allow general contractor G Corp to work on the $5.5 million development through completion. ",Lincoln Park,0.0
City Council approves 1649 N. Halsted,"The Chicago City Council has approved the mixed-use development planned at 1649 N. Halsted. Led by Draper and Kramer, the project will replace the shuttered Royal George Theater and adjacent four-story structure to the south. The former theater space is now considered obsolete as it has been marketed to other theater companies including Steppenwolf and ultimately the size, capacity, and configuration in a post-COVID era make it undesirable to continue using it as a theater. With SGW Architecture and Design in charge of the architecture, the building will stand eight floors high with a ninth partial floor that will hold amenity space and connect to an outdoor roof deck. Providing 131 rental units, the project’s unit mix will consist of 12 studios, 91 one-beds, 26 two beds and 2 three beds. Out of those units, 20 will be affordable with a mix of 2 studios, 14 one-beds, and 4 two-beds. To satisfy the remaining obligation of 6.2 units, Draper and Kramer will pay a fee in-lieu of $940,000. Inspired by the theater past of the site and vibrant theater community of the area, the front facade is a subtle allusion to a theater curtain, folding the glass wall to create a rippling effect reinforced by the slab edge covers that reference a modern treatment of bay windows. To reduce the mass of the building, the eighth and ninth floors have been setback considerably from the street. After conversations with Alderman Hopkins and neighbors, brick masonry was added to the building’s design and replaced glazing at the ground floor. Vertical ribbons of terracotta rainscreen have been added in a color that will match the brick. At the ground floor, the residential entry will be located at the north end of the frontage, while the 4,500 square feet of retail space will occupy the rest of the frontage and feature a 13-foot setback to allow space for outdoor dining as the retail space is targeted for a restaurant operator. Parking for 34 cars and 131 bikes is located in an enclosed garage on the ground floor accessed from the alley. The development sought a rezoning from B3-2 to B3-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. Alderman Hopkins officially gave his approval of the project after a contentious two years of negotiations and community meetings that resulted in some of the aforementioned design changes as well as a $300,000 investment that will go towards expanding a city park at the corner of North and Larrabee. After the Chicago Plan Commission approved the $53 million development in August, the proposal received approval from the Committee on Zoning and now finally the City Council, allowing for the project to move forward with its full entitlements. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Lincoln Park,1.0
DePaul University plans basketball practice facility,"DePaul University has announced plans to renovate the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena as well as to build a new practice facility for the school’s basketball teams. Planned for the northwest corner of W. Belden Ave and N. Sheffield Ave, the new facility will rise across the street from the current Sullivan Athletic Center and will replace a recently acquired, university-owned apartment complex in addition to four other smaller buildings in this area, including the current Athletics Annex and other housing-managed properties. Designed by HNTB and Antunovich Associates, the new facility will feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. While the addition of Wintrust Arena increased their visibility, ability to recruit, and footprint in Chicago, DePaul is continuing to take steps towards being able to provide each of the 15 sports programs with the facilities they need to be competitive in the BIG EAST Conference. DePaul men’s and women’s basketball will move their training, practices, and operations across the street from the Sullivan Athletics Center to allow for more dedicated spaces to support the programs.  Dedicated practice courts for each basketball program will greatly alleviate scheduling concerns, as all 15 of DePaul’s programs currently share the McGrath-Phillips Arena courts. The first floor of the facility will be dedicated to the health and wellness of all 215+ DePaul student-athletes, and will include a team dining space, nutrition bar, new sports medicine treatment spaces and offices, hydrotherapy, a weight room, and multi-purpose meeting rooms. Set to cost $60 million, the project will be funded primarily through donor gifts and via a fundraising campaign approved by the Philanthropy Committee of DePaul’s Board of Trustees. As the project moves forward, the demolition of buildings on site would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest. Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026.

Rental penthouses now leasing at The Belden-Stratford,"Leasing is now underway for a selection of just-released rental penthouses at The Belden-Stratford, the iconic Beaux-Arts apartment property in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighborhood that reopened this year following a full-scale restoration and renovation. The six penthouse residences showcase unobstructed views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline from the property’s upper floors, paired with thoughtfully designed floor plans and upscale finishes that complement historic structural details. “Our penthouse residences truly embody what makes The Belden-Stratford so special, from graceful spaces carefully appointed to appeal to today’s modern renters, to glimpses of this century-old building’s history and architecture, to an unmatched address in Lincoln Park that affords residents not only an amazing lifestyle, but also some of the very best views in the entire city,” said Ari Glass, head of real estate for Mansueto Office. Overlooking the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory, the 16-story property was constructed in 1923 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by architect Meyer Fridstein, it originally opened as a residential hotel before eventually transitioning entirely to rental apartments. The Belden-Stratford was purchased in 2018 by Mansueto Office – the investment firm of Joe Mansueto, who was a resident of the property during the 1980s – and renovation work began in late 2020. Today, it comprises 209 luxury apartments, including studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom residences as well as a selection of penthouses with double-height living space, with monthly rents ranging from $2,500 to $15,000. Penthouse rents start at $7,250. The penthouses are located on the 15th floor, along the building’s entire east and south sides, and are topped by the building’s roof deck. The five remaining penthouse floor plans include two one-bedroom designs with one and 1 1⁄2 baths, respectively; a two-bedroom, two-bath layout; and two residences with two bedrooms, two baths and a den. All penthouse residences feature extra-high ceilings – including spaces with 17-foot ceilings with decorative beams – and double-height windows topped by paned arches, which, in addition to framing sweeping views of Lake Michigan and Lincoln Park, are also a notable architectural detail accenting the building’s mansard roofline. Penthouse interiors feature upscale island kitchens with GE Profile stainless steel appliances and quartz countertops; upsized window trim; custom closets with built-in shelving; and full-size in-unit washer and dryer. Complementing the penthouse lifestyle at The Belden-Stratford is the ambiance of the building’s many original features and finishes that were restored during the renovation process. In the ornate double-height lobby, gilded plaster molding and gold-leaf detailing were fully refurbished, as were marble paneling and entryways adorned with mirrored windows and walnut trim, which had been covered during previous renovations. In addition, hand-painted canvases that hung on the walls when the building first opened were recreated. The renovation also introduced a full suite of lifestyle amenities as the building was reimagined for modern renters. Housed in the historic property’s original common spaces, they include an elegant mezzanine-level lounge with an original arched picture window overlooking the Lincoln Park Conservatory; a double-height fitness center in what was once the building’s ballroom; a billiards and media lounge; wine tasting room; temperature-controlled wine storage room; and reservable conference rooms and meeting areas. Residents also have access to a rooftop sun deck featuring a wet bar, outdoor TV, two gas fireplaces, grilling stations and multiple seating areas, all overlooking the skyline, Lincoln Park and Lake Michigan. Additional resident offerings include Luxer One package service and on-site Tesla rentals. The Belden-Stratford is also home to Mon Ami Gabi, a popular French bistro with a direct connection to the building’s lobby, giving residents an elegant on-site dining option in addition to the variety of restaurants found in the surrounding neighborhood. For leasing information or to schedule a tour, visit www.BeldenStratford.com or call (844) 326-5908. An on-site leasing office is open daily by appointment only.   ",Lincoln Park,0.0

Committee on Design reviews 2033 N. Kingsbury,"The Committee on Design has reviewed Sterling Bay’s proposal for a mixed-use tower at 2033 N. Kingsbury. Originally announced in September 2022, the project site is directly across the street from Lincoln Yards North. With a combination of low-rise retail buildings and parking lots surrounding the site, the tower will be a middle ground between the new high-density towers of Lincoln Yards and the low-rise neighbors along N. Clybourn Ave. Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the development was originally conceived as a 15-story residential tower that would stand 167 feet tall. In response to feedback, the tower was condensed and received a height increase, resulting in a 25-story, 275-foot-tall scheme. The project would have 359 residential units, 8,600 square feet of retail, 200 parking spaces, and 359 bike parking. Outdoors, the revised scheme increased the planned open space from 13,000 square feet to 22,000 square feet. The new design has increased the amount of air space around the tower and was pulled back to allow for a visual connection to the Lincoln Yards parkland from the Clybourn corridor. The massing steps back as it rises and offsets in plan to break up the scale of the building. At the base, the podium stands three stories tall to accommodate the planned 200 parking spaces on two floors. The facade has been designed with a residential character, using a gridded facade made up of brick and glass with aluminum slab edge covers. On the ground floor, the residential parking access is via a curb cut on the north end of the frontage along N. Kingsbury St to reduce pressure on the alley which is currently used for loading and trash pickup from the retail center along N. Clybourn Ave. The 8,600 square feet of retail is located at the south end of the frontage wrapping around to face the green space, with the residential lobby in the center of the ground floor. A setback of 21 feet at the retail space will allow for covered outdoor dining if the space is filled with a food service tenant. Jeanne Gang began the discussion by questioning the glass railings at the amenity decks with landscaping. The design team responded that they will be meeting the bird-friendly ordinance and the railing material may change through the design process. Gang clarified that glass itself wasn’t the problem, but that they would need to add a frit pattern regardless of the adjacency to the greenery to protect migratory birds. The design team committed to using a bird-safe glass solution or changing to a different material that wouldn't risk bird strikes.  Casey Jones chimed in next to commend the team on shrinking the building footprint and going taller with the tower. Jones followed it up with a comment that he felt the tower was not the best architectural addition to the city and hoped there would be greater refinement of the tower as the design progresses. The design team responded that the point was well-taken and they have a fair amount of work ahead of them to make refinements.  Eleanor Gorski mentioned that the wall facing the alley is currently a solid wall and would be visible over the retail strip mall from N. Clybourn Ave. Gorski urged the team to think about what that wall would be as it stands visible for an unknown amount of time before that retail center would potentially get redeveloped. While the design team also acknowledged that the retail center may eventually get redeveloped, they agreed that they don’t like to build blank walls and will get to refining that facade as they progress with the design. Andre Brumfield commented that he felt the taller building responded better to the context and that this revision is an improvement from the original scheme. Brumfield followed that up by saying that he felt it would improve the design if they brought some of the softening of the original massing into the current design.  Maria Villalobos finished the comment portion by asking what was driving the size of the podium. The design team responded that the podium is three floors to accommodate the 200 parking spaces and it may be able to shrink but not by much. Villalobos asked whether the parking count is a requirement or preference, to which the design team responded that it was a preference based on what the team thought market demand would be. With the input from the Committee on Design, the developer and architects will continue their work with DPD and likely revise the design before moving forward in the approval process. With a rezoning from M2-2 to B3-5 and a Planned Development requested for the site, the development will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.

Alderman Hopkins throws support behind 1649 N. Halsted,"Alderman Hopkins announced via an email to constituents that he will be supporting the zoning change for the mixed-use development at 1649 N. Halsted as it heads to the Plan Commission later this month. Originally proposed back in June 2021, developer Draper & Kramer had an initial meeting with Alderman Hopkins to rezone the former Royal George Theater property and a neighboring building to allow for the construction of a new, multi-family residential building with 192 units. After discussions with the alderman’s office and meeting with neighbors, the developer came back with a 134-unit proposal with ground floor retail space. The meetings also resulted in façade upgrades and changes in materials and window sizes.  Reductions were also made in the massing of the building on the upper floors. The developer also met with Steppenwolf Theater and decided to set aside 2-4 units for visiting Steppenwolf artists and indicate artist preference on all affordable units built (15% of total unit count). In the summer of 2022, the alderman hosted a community meeting where the proposal was shared with the wider neighborhood. Outcomes of that meeting included an agreement that deliveries and garbage pickup for both the residential and retail elements of the building would be limited to off-peak hours. It was also agreed at that meeting that residents of the proposed building would be restricted from obtaining on-street permit parking. With more feedback from the community and DPD, the developer and architects SGW Architecture & Design modified the design to add brickwork at grade instead of glass and vertical terracotta accents were added. At Alderman Hopkins’ request, the developer will also contribute $300,000 toward the construction of new park land at the southwest corner of N. Larrabee St and W. North Ave. This space, once a portion of Ogden Avenue's right-of-way, will significantly increase the size of Park 598 as the Chicago Park District prepares it to go through a major makeover. The project will connect the entire park with the greater neighborhood by bringing it underneath the CTA tracks and all the way north to North Avenue.  With the rezoning and Planned Development designation now in the approval process, Alderman Hopkins support allows the development to head to the Chicago Plan Commission to seek approvals before getting further approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council.

1649 N. Halsted heads to Plan Commission later this month,"The mixed-use development at 1649 N. Halsted is heading to Plan Commission later this month to seek approval. Led by Draper and Kramer, the project will replace the shuttered Royal George Theater and adjacent four-story structure to the south. The former theater space is now considered obsolete as it has been marketed to other theater companies including Steppenwolf and ultimately the size, capacity, and configuration in a post-COVID era make it undesirable to continue using it as a theater. With SGW Architecture and Design in charge of the architecture, the building will stand eight floors high with a ninth partial floor that will hold amenity space and connect to an outdoor roof deck. Providing 133 rental units, the project’s unit mix will consist of 12 studios, 25 one-beds, 68 loft-style one-beds (borrowed light bedrooms), 26 two-beds, and a final 2 three-bedroom apartments. At the ground floor, retail space will stretch along the majority of the street frontage, targeted for restaurant use. Parking for 35 cars will be located in an enclosed garage off the alley.  Inspired by the theater past of the site and vibrant theater community of the area, the front facade is a subtle allusion to a theater curtain, folding the glass wall to create a rippling effect reinforced by the slab edge covers that reference a modern treatment of bay windows. The mass of the building is designed to align with the approved building planned to the south of this site, and the top floor of units have been pulled back from the street frontage to reduce the mass of the building along the street. The development will be seeking a rezoning from B3-2 to B3-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. If the Chicago Plan Commission approves the project, the proposal will head to City Hall to get final approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. ",Lincoln Park,1.0
Urbanize gets an inside look at The Belden-Stratford,"Urbanize recently got an inside look at the Belden-Stratford, the iconic Beaux-Arts apartment building in Lincoln Park. Located at 2300 N. Lincoln Park West, the building has just reopened to residents following an extensive renovation that has restored the grandeur of the 100-year-old building while providing amenities and residences for today’s renters. Overlooking the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory, the 16-story property was constructed in 1923 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by architect Meyer Fridstein, it originally opened as a residential hotel before eventually transitioning entirely to rental apartments. The Belden-Stratford was purchased in 2018 by Mansueto Office – the investment firm of Joe Mansueto, who was a resident of the property during the 1980s – and renovation work began in late 2020. Today, it comprises 209 luxury apartments, including studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom residences as well as a selection of penthouses with double-height living space, with monthly rents ranging from $2,500 to $15,000.  With our tour led by Ted Fahey, vice president of real estate for Mansueto Office, we began in the building’s main lobby, whose gilded plaster molding and gold-leaf detailing was fully refurbished. With Solomon Cordwell Buenz as architect of record and Vinci Hamp Architects serving as the historic architect, much of the work done around the building was undoing changes made over the years to bring the property back to its original splendor. Heading up to the second floor, we toured the building’s new amenity offerings for residents. The building’s amenity package includes a two-level fitness center that used to be a ballroom, a billiards and media lounge, wine tasting room, reservable conference rooms and meeting space, and a basement wine storage room. Residents also have access to a mezzanine level lounge that overlooks the lobby and faces outside through an original arched picture window.  Working our way up the building, we next looked at a few model units. All residences have 9-foot ceilings and are appointed with an elegant finish package including quartz countertops, GE Profile™ stainless steel appliances and full-size, front-loading washers and dryers. The apartments measure between 483 and 1,689 square feet. We also stopped by one of the penthouse units on the 15th floor which feature double-height living spaces. We finished out the tour by heading up to the building’s roof deck. Outfitted with grilling stations and seating areas, the south- and east-facing roof deck provides extensive views of Lincoln Park, Lake Michigan, and the downtown skyline to the south. Leasing and move-ins are underway, and the building is expected to be fully occupied by year-end. For leasing information or to schedule a tour, visit www.BeldenStratford.com or call (844) 326-5908. An on-site leasing office is open daily by appointment only.   ",Lincoln Park,0.0
Zoning application submitted for 5035 N. Lincoln,"A zoning application has been submitted to City Council for a mixed-use development at 5035 N. Lincoln. Located at the southeast corner of N. Lincoln Ave and W. Winnemac Ave, the property was under development by a previous developer who went bankrupt. The site has sat dormant with two partially built six-flats and foundations for two further buildings on the northern half of the property. With the project being taken over by Vu Trieu of North Shore Development Group, the two buildings on the southern half of the site will be retained and construction will restart imminently. When finished after 6-8 months of construction, the buildings will have a total of 12 units with 15 parking spaces. Designed by Hanna Architects, the northern half of the site is proposed to be a five-story, mixed-use building instead of the two approved six-flats. The project will have 47 rental apartments that includes three live-work units, 16 one-beds, and 28 two-beds. Nine of the apartments will be set aside as affordable, planned at an average of 60% AMI. On the ground floor, there will be 1,200 square feet of commercial space at the corner of N. Lincoln Ave and W. Winnemac Ave. The three live/work units will front W. Winnemac Ave, with the residential lobby for the other units fronting N. Lincoln Ave. A parking garage for 15 cars will be located along the south side of the site, accessed from the alley. 47 bike parking spaces will also be provided inside the ground floor of the building. Topping out at 64 feet, the building’s design uses a combination of brick, white panels, and orange accents along N. Lincoln Ave. The facade along W. Winnemac Ave is stepped to fit within the angled site, while the N. Lincoln Ave facade will feature a mural to cover up the parking garage. All apartments will have their own private balconies around the building in addition to having access to a shared rooftop deck. The original development was approved under a Type 1 zoning amendment, so the new development will need to rezone from the Type 1 B2-3 zoning to a new B2-3 designation. With approval from Alderman Vasquez already secured, the development has now been submitted to City Council to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council.

ZBA approves variances for 4640 N. Western,"The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a series of variances for the mixed-use development at 4640 N. Western. Currently occupied by three existing buildings, the site spans from the CTA Western Brown Line tracks down to W. Eastwood Ave. Planned by Macon Construction, the four-story building will be retained and incorporated into the new construction, while the other two buildings will be demolished. Designed by Hirsch MPG, the mixed-use building will stand six stories tall, topping out at 91 feet tall. With 74 units in the building, the unit mix will include 8 studios, 28 one-beds, and 38 two-beds. The development will meet the ARO by providing 15 of the apartments as affordable, including 2 of the studios, 6 of the one-beds, and 7 of the two-beds. As part of the plans, residents would have access to a shared rooftop deck and dog run. On the ground floor, two live/work units will face N. Western just south of the CTA L tracks, with a two-bedroom unit behind it facing the space underneath the L tracks. The retail space will measure 3,900 square feet and another live/work unit will face W. Eastwood Ave. The residential lobby will front W. Eastwood Ave and parking for 10 cars will be provided along the alley. 74 bike parking spaces will be available, and the developer added a bike maintenance space upon request of the community. The design of the overall building has a consistent stone base that wraps the ground floor before switching to a brick facade up above. The massing has multiple insets along the face of the building to break up the scale and the corner space on the sixth floor was removed to bring down the scale of the corner. The building is further refined with larger windows, a two-tone brick treatment, and masonry stone detailing. In terms of sustainability, the development will meet the new energy code, provide EV charging, utilize a high-efficiency MEP system, and provide electric appliances in all of the units.  With approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals, the development will receive a series of variances. The first variation allows for the reduction of the rear setback from the required 30 feet to zero. A second variation will allow for the reduction of required off street parking spaces from 74 to 10 due to its status as a transit served location. Another variation allows for the elimination of the one required loading space. The project is also receiving two special uses to allow for residential use below the second floor and to establish the three business live/work units on the ground floor. With ZBA approvals secured, the $26.7 million development has another layer of approvals clearing the way for construction to proceed. Construction could start as soon as Spring 2024 and wrap up in Summer 2025 after 15 months of construction. ",Lincoln Square,1.0

4715 N. Western scores full building permit,"**UPDATED RENDERINGS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY DESIGNBRIDGE** A full building permit has been issued for 4715 N. Western. Located at the intersection of W. Leland Ave and N. Western Ave, the site is currently a city-owned public parking lot on the northeastern corner of the intersection. The Community Builders is the developer behind the concept, with The Boar Company as a new co-developer. Originally proposed back in 2019, the project was awarded LIHTC financing in late 2021. The development scheme at that time called for a five-story building that would hold 5,000 square feet of retail space, 51 affordable apartments, 41 public parking spaces, and 9 private parking spaces for residents. During the city’s further review after conditionally awarding the LIHTC financing, the development was thrown into question after the city demanded less parking in the building and that the parking access be moved from N. Western Ave to the alley. With DesignBridge on tap as the architect, the compromise resulted in a six-story building that will deliver a total of 63 new affordable homes, 4,995 square feet of ground floor commercial space, expanded outdoor public space, and a second-floor parking deck that will include 36 parking spaces. Down from an original 50 spaces, the 36 will be split into 18 for the public and 18 for private residents. The building will be topped by a green roof and rooftop deck for residents. The parking entrance will be retained along N. Western Ave based on feedback from local business owners and residents that a potential entrance in the alley would pose multiple logistical and safety issues.  To fund the project, the City Council sold six city-owned parcels, appraised at a value of $4.925 million, to the developers at a total of $6, charging $1 per parcel. Further financing includes up to $12 million in TIF funding, $12 million in city multi-family program funds, $15.9 in lender financing, $14.5 million in LIHTC funding, $2.1 million in donation tax credits, $140,000 from a ComEd grant, and $2 million from a new hope construction bridge loan.   With the full building permit issued, general contractor Leopardo Companies can begin construction.

Western Ave based on feedback from local business owners and residents that a potential entrance in the alley would pose multiple logistical and safety issues.  With approval from the City Council, the six city-owned parcels, appraised at a value of $4.925 million, will be sold to the developers at a total of $6, charging $1 per parcel. The development will be funded with up to $12 million in TIF funding, $12 million in city multi-family program funds, $15.9 in lender financing, $14.5 million in LIHTC funding, $2.1 million in donation tax credits, $140,000 from a ComEd grant, and $2 million from a new hope construction bridge loan.   Originally proposed back in 2019, the project was awarded LIHTC financing in late 2021. The development scheme at that time called for a five-story building that would hold 5,000 square feet of retail space, 51 affordable apartments, 41 public parking spaces, and 9 private parking spaces for residents. During the city’s further review after conditionally awarding the LIHTC financing, the development was thrown into question after the city demanded less parking in the building and that the parking access be moved from N. Western Ave to the alley. With the Chicago City Council approving the development’s funding plan, the project is fully entitled and can move forward with permitting and construction. Construction was previously set to begin as soon as Spring 2023, but that will be pushed back as permits have yet to be issued.  ",Lincoln Square,1.0
Mixed-use development proposed at 4640 N. Western,"A mixed-use development has been proposed at 4640 N. Western. Currently occupied by three existing buildings, the site spans from the CTA Western Brown Line tracks down to W. Eastwood Ave. Proposed by Macon Construction Group, the four-story building will be retained and incorporated into the new construction.  Designed by Hirsch MPG, the proposed rental building would stand six stories tall, measuring 70 feet tall. With 73 units in the building, the unit mix will consist of 8 studios renting at $1,500/month, 26 one-beds renting at $1,700/month, and 39 two-beds renting at $2,700/month. 11 of the units will be set aside as affordable, including one studio and 10 two-beds. While 20% of the units are usually required to be affordable, the number of affordable units can be reduced if the development includes a larger share of bigger units.  Planned as a mixed-use building, the building will hold 4,650 square feet of retail space at the corner of W. Eastwood Ave and N. Western Ave, with two live/work units at the base of the reused building alongside the L. The residential lobby will be accessed from W. Eastwood Ave, with 10 car parking spaces and 73 bike parking spaces off of the alley. This development represents a shift in plans for the site after Glascott & Associates received approval in 2021 to renovate the four-story building and build an addition in place of the one-story building. That project went as far as receiving permits to demolish the one-story building which will also be eliminated in this new proposal.  With the site currently zoned B3-3 and B3-2, the new developer is looking to get a unified B3-5 before proceeding with construction. If approvals proceed, they would look to begin construction this fall and deliver the building in Fall 2024. ",Lincoln Square,1.0
Developers return with options at 2300 W. Ainslie,"Developer CKG Realty Group has come back to the community with two options for the development site at 2300 W. Ainslie. Currently home to the St. Matthias Rectory, the property sits at the northwest corner of W. Ainslie St and N. Oakley Ave. Rejected by the community, the developer’s prior proposal sought to convert the rectory into 9 apartments and build a new 8-unit building on the east side of the property. Looking forward, the developer has come to the table with two new options.  Presenting the first option, the developer would convert the rectory to apartments and build new townhomes along N. Oakley Ave. Planned as five townhomes, four of them would have four bedrooms and the final one would have three bedrooms. Rising three floors, the townhomes have been designed with Prairie Style architecture.  With this scheme requesting a rezoning from RS-3 to RM-4, the project would include 3 affordable units and open community green space. The developers reduced the building size and unit count by 40%, increased green space, and redesigned the building in response to feedback that the previous design was “unattractive and inconsistent with the neighborhood.” If the community were to reject that zoning change, the developers would resort to pursuing an as-of right development. To make that work, they would demolish the rectory and build five new single-family homes. Set to cost in the mid-million dollar range, this version of the project would have no community green space, no affordable units, and would result in the loss of the rectory.  With the proposal presented to the community, the developers are awaiting a decision from Alderman Vasquez before knowing whether they can proceed to the City Council for rezoning the site. A timeline for construction is unknown.   ",Lincoln Square,0.0
City Council approves 4715 N. Western,"The Chicago City Council has approved the long-discussed mixed-use affordable housing development at 4715 N. Western. Located at the intersection of W. Leland Ave and N. Western Ave, the site is currently a city-owned public parking lot on the northeastern corner of the intersection. The Community Builders is the developer behind the concept, with The Boar Company as a new co-developer. Originally proposed back in 2019, the project was awarded LIHTC financing in late 2021. The development scheme at that time called for a five-story building that would hold 5,000 square feet of retail space, 51 affordable apartments, 41 public parking spaces, and 9 private parking spaces for residents. During the city’s further review after conditionally awarding the LIHTC financing, the development was thrown into question after the city demanded less parking in the building and that the parking access be moved from N. Western Ave to the alley. With DesignBridge on tap as the architect, the now-approved scheme represents a compromise between the city agencies, the community, the local alderman, and the developer. The plan will produce a six-story building that will deliver a total of 63 new affordable homes (up from 51), 4,995 square feet of ground floor commercial space, expanded outdoor public space, and a second-floor parking deck that will include 36 parking spaces. Down from an original 50 spaces, the 36 will be split into 18 for the public and 18 for private residents. The building will be topped by a green roof and rooftop deck for residents. The parking entrance will be retained along N. Western Ave based on feedback from local business owners and residents that a potential entrance in the alley would pose multiple logistical and safety issues.  As an all-affordable building, the 63 units will be marketed at a mix of incomes, including at 30% AMI, 60% AMI, and 80% AMI. The units will be split up into 25 studios, 29 one-beds, and 9 two-beds. In addition to the hotly contested parking, residents will have access to 66 bike parking spaces on the ground floor.  Back in September 2022, the Community Development Commission approved the sale of the six city-owned parcels, appraised at a value of $4.925 million, for a total of $6, charging $1 per parcel. The $35.7 million development will be funded with a $3.5 million mortgage, $8 million in TIF, $8 million in a DOH loan, $1.5 million in IL Donation Tax Credit Equity, and $14.5 million in 9% LIHTC equity.  With the approval from the Chicago City Council, the proposed rezoning from B3-2 to B3-3 with an overall Planned Development designation is complete and fully approved. While already approved by the Community Development Commission, the funding plan will need to head to City Hall for final approval. Construction could begin as soon as this spring.  ",Lincoln Square,1.0
Full building permit issued for 5235 N. Western,"Permits have been issued for a mixed-use building at 5235 N. Western. Located at the northeast corner of W. Farragut Ave and N. Western Ave, the new construction will replace an existing one-story building and surface parking lot that used to house a Byline Bank branch.   Developed by Panoptic Group, the new as-of right development is set to rise four floors, holding ground-floor retail and 18 residential units. Positioned as units that are similar to single-family homes, each unit has 4 bedrooms with 2 car parking spaces designated for them in the heated garage on the ground floor.  Designed by Hanna Architects, the building will have a gridded expression, insetting the building facade in places, breaking up the length of the building. Clad in a dark gray brick, the building will front the street with brick piers and storefront glazing for the retail spaces. Units will have private balconies and deck spaces. All of the penthouses will have great views of Chicago from their roof decks.  With permits issued for the project, Panoptic Group, also acting as the general contractor, can begin construction. Delivery is estimated for Winter 2023. ",Lincoln Square,0.0
Sterling Bay plans two mixed-use towers at 1840 N. Marcey,"Sterling Bay has submitted a rezoning proposal for two mixed-use towers at 1840 N. Marcey. Located near Lincoln Yards, the project site is across the street from the former General Iron site. Currently occupied by a one-story industrial building, the property is a long, rectangular site bound by N. Clifton Ave to the north, N. Kingsbury St to the west, N. Marcey St to the east, and W. Wisconsin St to the south.   With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board for the design, the project will redevelop the site with two new towers. Designed as a pair, both buildings will have low-rise parking podiums clad in a mixture of brick and glass topped by amenity decks. Setting back from the podiums, the residential towers will also utilize similar facade strategies. The east and west elevations will be expressed as more opaque with a combination of architectural-grade aluminum and glass in a window wall system. The north and south elevations will be almost entirely clad in glass with an aluminum and glass window wall system.   The northern building, located within Subarea A, will be the larger tower, rising 27 floors. Standing 321 feet tall, the building will have ground floor retail space and 315 residential units. 262 car parking spaces and 315 bike parking spaces will be included in the building.  On the ground floor, the retail space will front N. Kingsbury St and N. Clifton Ave, with the residential lobby facing south onto an internal motor court that separates the two buildings. Parking access will be from N. Kingsbury St and loading access will be from N. Marcey St. The southern tower, located within Subarea B, will be slightly smaller, standing 16 stories tall. Rising 214 feet tall, this second building will have 294 residential units and more ground floor retail space. Just 98 parking spaces and 294 bike parking spaces will be provided within the building. The site plan shows this lower tower having a curving form in plan, with the retail space at the south end along N. Marcey St as well as some at the north end along N. Kingsbury St and facing internally towards the motor court. The residential lobby will face east onto an open landscaped plaza that is located along N. Marcey St. Loading access will be from N. Kingsbury St and parking access will be from the north end of the building via the internal motor court. To meet the ARO obligation of 20%, Sterling Bay is planning to provide 92 affordable units within the buildings and pay a fee in-lieu of $4.5 million to cover the remaining 30 units.  The newly proposed development will need a rezoning from M2-3 to B3-3 with an overall Planned Development designation to allow for the new construction. Sterling Bay is also expected to take a 3.5 FAR bonus by paying into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. Approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council will be required for the development to move forward. ",Lincoln Yards,1.0
Next phase of Lincoln Yards will break ground this year,"Sterling Bay has outlined its updated timeline for The Steelyard at Lincoln Yards. Presenting to a community meeting led by North Branch Works, Sterling Bay announced that construction has been completed on 1229 W. Concord, a 280,000 square foot life sciences office building that Urbanize toured back in September 2022. As part of this construction, W. Concord Pl has been extended and a new portion of riverwalk has been completed. As the next phase of Lincoln Yards, The Steelyard will be built to the north of 1229 W. Concord, between a newly extended N. Throop St and the river. Sited at the corner of W. Concord Pl and N. Throop St, 1665 N. Throop will be a 15-story office building. Rising 218 feet, the structure will front the promenade and N. Throop St with retail space and an office lobby. Designed by Gensler, the structure will exhibit a concrete diagrid encased in a glass curtain wall. 140 car parking spaces and 70 bike parking spaces will be incorporated, accessed from W. Concord Pl. The eastern side of this parcel, known as C.1, will deliver two entertainment venues, including one holding 1,000 seats and one holding 3,500 seats.  Just to the north of 1665 N. Throop, 1687 N. Throop will be a 19-story, 223-foot-tall mixed-use building. Meeting the ground with two floors of commercial and retail space, the remainder of the tower will hold 350 residential units. The unit mix will consist of 102 studios, 171 one-beds, 73 two-beds, and 4 three-beds. Of those units 35 will be affordable, with 10 studios, 17 one-beds, and 8 two-beds.  Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the building is made up of two wings facing the park, with a bridge element between them. Terraces step back as the building rises, with balconies integrated into the facade. The building will have 150 parking spaces located underneath the park’s athletic fields and 75 bike parking spaces. The Market Hall will be located to the east of the new tower. Designed for food and beverage tenants, the one-story building will be a key node and front both the park and interior promenade.  Occupying the rest of the space north of the new buildings and east of N. Throop St, Parcel B.1 will contain a newly constructed park, riverwalk and seawall. Designed by Site Design Group, the park will feature active recreational uses including a dog run, recreation fields and courts, and a children’s playground. An overlook with a seating area is placed at the northern end of the park facing the river. A couple of small buildings will provide public restrooms as well as space for canoe and kayak rental. A canoe and kayak launch will be located along the eastern edge of the park along the riverwalk. The new riverwalk will engage with a naturalized river edge and connect to the new section in front of 1229 W. Concord Pl.  With site plan approval already obtained for these buildings, Sterling Bay plans to break ground on 1665 N. Throop and 1687 N. Throop by the end of the year. The developer plans to phase the construction of the park, starting with the southern portion near the new buildings to accelerate the delivery of green space for the development. Foundation permits are currently pending for both of the towers. Once construction begins, each tower will take approximately two years to build. ",Lincoln Yards,1.0
Urbanize tours progress at 1229 W. Concord,"Urbanize recently toured the ongoing construction at 1229 W. Concord. Planned by Sterling Bay as its first building at Lincoln Yards, the new life sciences building will deliver 280,000 rentable square feet. Rising 144 feet, the nine-story development was designed by Gensler, featuring a glass and aluminum facade enclosing the building. 45 parking spaces will be provided in the basement. Coming from the Lincoln Yards Experience Center, we entered the site where the new extension of W. Concord Pl meets N. Throop St. Work on the road itself is wrapping up and utilities are beginning to be connected to the building. Entering at the west end of the ground floor, we walked through the fitness and wellness center before passing into the double-height lobby. Fronting W. Concord Pl, the lobby will include a reception desk with turnstiles for accessing the elevators. At the eastern end of the ground floor, a monumental spiral staircase will float within the lobby space, with a pre-function space behind it for the conference center that occupies the eastern end of the second floor.  Overlooking the river, a new portion of riverwalk is currently under construction in front of the building. The section will be connected to W. Concord Place for bicycle and pedestrian access, with stepped terraces used to create different spaces within the setback riverwalk area. Seating elements and landscaped areas will round out the exterior space’s design.  Heading up the building, our next stop on the tour was the eighth floor, which is the highest rentable office floor. With the building hosting 280,000 square feet of rentable space, the life sciences distinction means that each floor plate is split into 50% wet lab space and 50% office space. With typical office floors occupying the third through eighth levels, wet lab space will utilize the southern half of the floor plate, while the office space will occupy the northern half of the floor plate. Every floor will have a private balcony for the office tenants that faces southeast, overlooking the river and views of downtown.  Our last stop was the ninth floor which is exclusively occupied by massive mechanical units and machinery. As a life sciences building, the mechanical and ventilation needs are much higher than a typical office building, requiring this entire mechanical floor. As pictured, an enormous DOAS, or Dedicated Outdoor Air System, sits on the roof with a huge chiller to service the building with fresh air and ventilation.  With work progressing rapidly, general contractor Power Construction expects to reach substantial completion by April 2023. Tenant build outs could begin as soon as the end of this year in line with leasing activity. As Sterling Bay looks to begin the next phase of Lincoln Yards, horizontal infrastructure will be built out for N. Throop St and The Steelyard will be the next phase of work alongside the new park. Permits have been filed for the 15-story office building at 1665 N. Throop and the 19-story residential building at 1687 N. Throop, which will overlook the park to the north.

The building will have a150 parking spaces located underneath the park’s athletic fields and 75 bike parking spaces.  The Market Hall will be located to the east of the new tower. Designed for food and beverage tenants, the one-story building will be a key node and front both the park and interior promenade.  Designed by Hoerr Schaudt Landscape Architects, the promenade is a public pedestrian space between the Parcel D.1 and C.1 buildings. Running east/west it will stitch the two buildings together, incorporating site furnishings, landscaping beds, and seating. Vehicular drop off will extend up from W. Concord Pl.  The final site, Parcel C.1 will hold a 15-story office building. Rising 218 feet, the structure will front the promenade and N. Throop St with retail space and an office lobby. Designed by Gensler, the structure will exhibit a concrete diagrid encased in a glass curtain wall. 140 car parking spaces and 70 bike parking spaces will be incorporated, accessed from W. Concord Pl. The eastern side of the parcel will deliver two entertainment venues, including one holding 1,000 seats and one holding 3,500 seats.  As part of the already approved Planned Development, the buildings will only require internal site plan review from DPD. Sterling Bay will break ground on Parcels C.1 and D.1 as well as the first phase of the park in Q2 of this year. This work is expected to be completed in Q3 of 2024. ",Lincoln Yards,1.0
Sterling Bay reveals plans for Lincoln Yards South,"Sterling Bay will present plans to the public for the next phase of Lincoln Yards, dubbed Lincoln Yards South, on Tuesday 12/13 at their Lincoln Yards Experience Center. Plans for this phase were revealed via a presentation listed on the city’s Department of Planning and Development website ahead of the public open house. The documents show that this portion of the masterplan is a collaboration between firms Gensler, Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, Site Design Group, and Hoerr Schaudt Landscape Architects. This section, dubbed The Steelyard, is comprised of multiple subareas including plots B.1, C.1, D.1, D.2, and D.3. ALLY is located on Parcel G.1, south of the to-be extended W Concord Place. C.1 will be directly north of W Concord Place across from ALLY, with Parcel D.1 north of C.1. The Steelyard Main Street will separate the two, turning the corner down to W Concord Place before it gets to the river. An unrevealed Parcel D.2 and D.3 will front the river, sitting to the east of Parcels C.1 and D.1. A large park, bound by N Throop Street, Parcel D.1, and the river, will be built over two phases, rounding out Lincoln Yards South.  The park space at B.1 will provide new residents with 6.5 acres of newly-created green space in the North Branch Corridor, per DPD’s website. Sterling Bay will be operating the park similar to the Chicago Park District, offering on site fields and spaces for organized league play, public free play, and special events. The park will boast four turf fields, a hard spot court, a playground, a dog run, and seating and flex space overlooking the river. The park will meet the water with a new riverwalk that includes a canoe/kayak launch and water taxi stop.  Parcel C.1 will be home to 1685 Throop, a mid-rise mixed-use building. Measuring 365,000 square feet, the building will offer 28,000-35,000 square foot office floor plates, 24,400 square feet of tenant amenity space, and up to 25,000 square feet of retail space. Located along the mixed-use lifestyle district, the building will include a venue and entertainment space. While no official height has been announced, zoning documents show a recent minor change request allowed for the height to be increased from an original 150 feet to 225 feet. The next plot in The Steelyard is Parcel D.1. Yet to be named, this next building will hold 355,000 square feet of residential space, retail space, and residential amenities, while overlooking the newly-planned park. A fully-glass facade will ensure unobstructed views, with exterior terraces lining the building's exterior. Like 1685 N Throop, this building was also subject to the minor change request for height, so this tower may rise up to 225 feet. 1685 N Throop and Parcel D.1 face onto what has been named “The Steelyard Main Street”, a pedestrian corridor and lifestyle and entertainment district. Retail and venue spaces will be accessible from this passageway that separates the buildings. A vehicular drop-off will extend north into the promenade from W Concord Place, between Parcel C.1 and the future D.2 and D.3.  According to a phasing plan provided by Sterling Bay, the currently under-construction ALLY at 1229 W Concord Place should be complete by 2022/2023 along with W Concord Place infrastructure improvements. 2024 will deliver 1685 N Throop, Parcel D.1, The Steelyard Main Street, marketplace retail, roads and utilities for The Steelyards, the first phase of the park at B.1, and finally a parking pedestal at Parcel E.1 and E.2, located on the west side of Throop Street.  The final deliveries of The Steelyards will come in 2025 with the completion of the unrevealed D.2 and D.3 residential buildings, the second phase of the park at B.1, the completed riverwalk and water taxi stop, completion of the Throop Street bridge and infrastructure, as well as the extension of the 606.  Sterling Bay’s public open house is a part of their master plan process, with the city requiring the collection of public feedback. A courtesy presentation to the Chicago Plan Commission is also required, however the commission will not vote as the master plan is already approved.  ",Lincoln Yards,0.0
ALLY at 1229 W. Concord lands full building permit,"ALLY at 1229 W. Concord Place, the first building of the Lincoln Yards megadevelopment, has received a full building permit for construction. Developed by Sterling Bay, the new building has already commenced construction with work beginning on the foundation. The tower crane was also recently erected.  Designed by Gensler, the development will produce a nine-story office building that will host approximately 280,000 square feet of Class A medical research lab space paired with office space. Tenants will enter the building off a newly extended W. Concord Place through a double-height lobby. The building will offer amenities including an event space, a conference center, a fitness and wellness center, and a tenant lounge. 55 parking spaces for tenants will be located underground.  The building’s design consists of a facade that features a combination of floor-to-ceiling windows and aluminium trim. Its massing is split into two bars that are offset to extend views to the river and downtown. The typical floor plate maximizes flexibility for tenants, while a staircase on the western façade allows for ease of travel between floors. Each level has an exterior terrace along the eastern façade facing the river.  The 144-foot-tall structure will front the river with a new section of riverwalk, the first of Lincoln Yards’s planned riverwalk. The section will be connected to W. Concord Place for bicycle and pedestrian access, with stepped terraces used to create different spaces within the setback riverwalk area.

First building at Lincoln Yards lands construction financing,"Construction is imminent on the first new building of the massive 55-acre Lincoln Yards megaproject along the north branch of the Chicago River. Dubbed ""ALLY at 1229 W. Concord Place,"" the eight-story building will provide 280,000 square feet of Class A medical research labs, creative office space, tenant amenities, and underground parking for 55 cars. Lincoln Yards developer Sterling Bay with partners Harrison Street and J.P. Morgan Asset Management announced on Thursday that it had closed on a $125 million construction loan for the project from Bank OZK. Pre-development construction work at the riverfront parcel is underway, and an official groundbreaking ceremony for the Gensler-designed building will take place sometime in October, according to Sterling Bay. The city has already issued both foundation and tower crane permits for the site at 1229 W. Concord. Phase one of Lincoln Yards also includes an extension of the Concord Place roadway and an improved river wall and landscaped riverwalk along the north branch. The upcoming building is expected to take approximately 24 months to complete, and Power Construction will serve as general contractor.  ""Chicago is an emerging market for biotechnology, supported by world-class academic institutions and a reputation for advanced medical research, but the city's current inventory of superior lab space prevents the industry from reaching its highest potential here,"" said Andy Gloor, CEO of Sterling Bay, in a statement. ""ALLY at 1229 W. Concord Place—and the forthcoming innovation district at Lincoln Yards—will meet the needs of today's most exciting and rapidly expanding life sciences companies, create a new home for scientific research in Chicago, and help the city continue to build its reputation as a major player in this critically important sector,"" Gloor added. The phase-one building is located at the southeastern-most parcel of the estimated $6 billion Lincoln Yards project. Spanning both sides of the river, the phased plan will eventually include multiple mixed-use high-rises totaling more than 14 million square feet as well as new bridges, roads, and 21 acres of open space. When complete, Lincoln Yards will support more than 23,000 on-site jobs, according to Sterling Bay. Earlier this year, the developer finished a $9 million, three-year-plus environmental remediation of the entire site, which was previously home to heavy industry. The process involved removing underground storage tanks, timber foundations, and old sub-basements as well as treating the soil for harmful contaminants such as petroleum compounds, hazardous PCBs, chlorinated solvents, and lead.

Sterling Bay completes environmental remediation at Lincoln Yards site,"Sterling Bay, the developer behind the massive multiphase Lincoln Yards project, has completed a years-long clean-up of 55 acres of polluted brownfield land along the Chicago River between Lincoln Park and Bucktown. ""For the last four years, we've been working with expert geologists and environmental engineers to reverse over a century's worth of industrial damage in the North Branch Corridor,"" said Sterling Bay CEO Andy Gloor on Thursday. ""The land we started with at Lincoln Yards was heavily polluted and unsuitable for community use, but today, Chicago residents are one major step closer to enjoying what will soon become a thriving new neighborhood that prioritizes the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors,"" Gloor announced. Environmental remediation at the future Lincoln Yards site has been underway since 2017. In 2019, Sterling Bay and contractors V3 Companies, RW Collins, TRS Group, and Heneghan Wrecking completed clean-up work on the north portion of the property, which was previously home to heavy industries such as the A. Finkl and Sons steel mill. ""The south portion had a similar history,"" explained Keith Oswald, director of environment and geosciences at V3 Companies. ""It used to be Illinois Steel North Works from the 1850s up until the 1970s. The site was then used by Proctor & Gamble for a while and then the City of Chicago for its fleet maintenance facility."" While working at Lincoln Yards South, crews discovered a series of old brick tunnels containing oily sediment, as well as timber foundations, storage tanks, and sub-basements that had to be removed. ""We conduct investigations before digging, but you don't really know what's there until you open up the can,"" said Oswald. ""Expecting the unexpected is part of the process, but it's still a surprise what you run into.""  In addition to demolishing and removing old underground structures, the soil itself—nearly 28,000 tons worth—had to be treated for harmful contaminants such as petroleum compounds, hazardous PCBs, chlorinated solvents, and lead.  ""Our remediation strategy was driven by the need to ensure there would be no adverse impact on the Chicago River,"" Sterling Bay project manager Jack Kim told Urbanize.  ""Impacted soils were excavated and disposed of at a licensed disposal facility,"" explained Kim. ""In some cases, the contaminated soils required pre-treatment with various chemical reagents to render the material non-hazardous before it was allowed to leave the site.""  To remove harmful chlorinated solvents, the team used a method known as electrical resistance heating. A series of electrical poles were placed in the ground and the contaminants were slowly ""cooked"" out of the soil over six months, collected as a vapor, and removed. The clean-up work at Lincoln Yards cost roughly $9 million. Although Sterling Bay has a Tax Increment Financing deal with the city to be reimbursed for infrastructure improvements such as new roads and bridges, environmental work is not TIF eligible and must be paid for by the developer.  ""Sterling Bay's environmental remediation efforts at Lincoln Yards represent huge progress in addressing community health issues caused by the site's industrial past, and I'm very pleased that their team continues to make good on its commitment to creating a cleaner, safer environment in the North Branch Corridor,"" said Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd), in a statement. With the environmental work now complete on both the north and south portions of the site, Sterling Bay is ready to turn its attention toward vertical construction at Lincoln Yards. The megaproject's first phase calls for a new life sciences building located at the southern portion of the site, along Concord Place. Sterling Bay will break ground on the Gensler-designed building in July and expect construction to take approximately 24 months to complete. The phase one structure will be joined by an extension of Concord Place as well as corresponding river wall improvements made along the edge of the new building, according to the developer. The full Lincoln Yards development will be built in phases and will eventually include multiple mixed-use high-rises spanning more than 14 million square feet. The plan calls for roughly 21 acres of open space as well as a public riverwalk.  Sterling Bay plans to pursue LEED certification for each of its individual buildings as well as for the entire Lincoln Yards development.

Rush seeks zoning for five-story inpatient facility ,"As Rush University Medical Center puts the finishing touches on its upcoming Joan and Paul Rubschlager Building, the Near West Side hospital is seeking city approval to construct a five-story inpatient facility at the northwest corner of Harrison and Loomis streets. Known as Rush Speciality Hospital, the proposed free-standing structure would span roughly 135,000 square feet. It would contain 100 beds (56 for comprehensive rehabilitation and 44 for long-term acute care), therapy equipment, and dining/sitting areas for patients, staff, and visitors. The estimated $109.5 million project is a joint venture between Rush and Select Medical Corporation and is expected to create between 800 and 1000 temporary construction jobs and at least 300 permanent positions. Designed by HDR Inc. in collaboration with GWG3 Architecture, the plan calls for an outdoor therapy area plus a 70-car parking lot and new landscaping located just west of the building. The project is slated for a 2.9-acre vacant parcel previously occupied by student housing. Before work can begin on the Rush Speciality Hospital, the Chicago Plan Commission and City Council will need to approve an amendment to the site's existing Institutional Planned Development.

Developer Cedar St. delivers 202 apartments to Chicago's Near West Side,"After breaking ground early last year, Cedar St. Companies and partner Origin Investments have wrapped up construction on a seven-story, 202-unit rental development at 1461 S. Blue Island Avenue near the border of Little Italy and Pilsen. Known as The Rosie, the newly finished building offers apartments ranging from micro-studios with monthly rents starting at $1,645 to larger two-bed units topping out at roughly $2,700 per month. Select studios feature high-tech ""smart"" furniture from Ori Design that maximizes space with beds that slide out of the way when not being used.   Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, The Rosie features a brick base topped by metal and glass residential floors. An L-shaped layout takes advantage of its triangular lot to optimize outdoor space and views. There are two ground-floor retail spaces totaling nearly 7,000 square feet and outdoor murals lining 15th Street.  Building amenities include a resident lounge, a fitness center, a dog run, and an 8,500-square-foot pool deck facing the Chicago skyline. Parking is spread across a 110-car garage and a 21-vehicle surface parking lot. In early 2020, the estimated $65 million development (then known by the name ""Pilsen Gateway"") scored tax incentives for being located in a federal Opportunity Zone, reported Crain's. The Rosie was approved by the city before City Hall boosted its affordable housing requirements for new projects, so only seven of the 202 units are designated as affordable.  ""Cedar St. shares our enthusiasm for innovation, and we enjoyed collaborating with them on new concepts like the Ori smart furniture package during development to add value for our renters,"" said David Scherer, principal of Origin Investments, in a statement. ""The Rosie is in one of the most vibrant submarkets in our own backyard and we're excited for a successful lease up."" ",Little Italy,0.0
Preliminary landmark approved for Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse. Originally built as a loft building in the late nineteenth century, the existing building is from a 1927 reconstruction by architects Hall, Bisbee & Rhenisch that added a concrete internal structure, additional height and a completely new and stylish façade.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is emblematic of changing social patterns that emerged in America after World War I and increased through the boom years of the 1920s, especially increased mobility of American households, urbanization that resulted in families living in smaller apartments, and increased consumption of household goods, some of which like pianos, furs, and wool rugs that required special storage. To meet the demands for increasing mobility and storage, the Jackson Storage and Van Company was part of the household goods and storage industry that emerged and developed throughout the nation during the twentieth century.  The building also meets Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. The design of the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is inspired by Venetian Gothic architecture, and specifically that city’s Doge’s Palace. Examples of Venetian Gothic architecture are rare in Chicago and the nation. With its tapestry brick façade and terra cotta ground level arcade, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse displays a high degree of design and craftsmanship in these traditional materials. The Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse is an example of a household storage and moving warehouse, a building type found throughout Chicago characterized by limited fenestration and designs that, when successful, reduce the monolithic character of this build- 23 ing type through ornament and detail. Meeting the separate Integrity Criterion, the Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse remains in its original location on Cermak Road and its setting on a commercial street serving the residential communities of North and South Lawndale remains little changed since the building was reconstructed to its present form in 1927. The Venetian Gothic design and materials of the building are largely preserved. Changes to the building include replacement of the upper floor windows and the plate-glass storefront windows at the first floor. In addition, steel grates have been added to several windows, though the grates at the windows above the street-level entrances are original and should be preserved. These changes to the building are typical for a building of this vintage and do not sufficiently diminish its integrity. Based on its evaluation of Jackson Storage and Van Company Warehouse, the Commission staff recommends that the significant features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building and the Batchelder tile water fountain in the first-floor office. The common brick east and west elevations of the building are devoid of architectural treatment and secondary. The Commission may approve more significant changes to these elevations to support new uses of the building. The foregoing is not intended to limit the Commission’s discretion to approve other changes. With the preliminary recommendation approved, historic preservation staff will develop a landmark report to be presented to the Commission before a final landmark recommendation is voted on. If approved, the proposed designation would head to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. ",Little Village,0.0

Plan Commission approves Focal Point Community Campus,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved the proposed Focal Point Community Campus. Located on a large site, the project will occupy approximately 29 acres at the southwestern corner of W. 31st St and S. Kedzie Ave. Planned by Chicago Southwest Development Corporation, the new campus has been in the works for over 10 years.  With a design from HDR, the new campus will facilitate the future construction of multiple buildings. The main anchor will be a new 12-story building for Saint Anthony’s Hospital that will rise 240 feet. In addition, the site will deliver a medical office building, central utility plant (CUP), commercial and retail space, outdoor athletic fields, a vocational school, surgical center, daycare, and office. A total of 1,245 parking spaces are proposed for the site, with most located in a large parking structure that will have the athletic fields topping it.  The complex has been divided into project zones, creating zones for community gathering, health and wellness, education and commerce, and sports and recreation. The developers plan to create a gateway at the intersection of W. 31st St and S. Kedzie Ave. The plan originally included a potential housing component which has been deferred for future consideration and would come back to the Plan Commission for future approvals.  The interior of the site has had the interior streets aligned with the city grid and the parking count was reduced to create an interior recreation trail that reaches from W. 31st St down to S. Kedzie Ave at the southeastern edge of the campus.  The buildout of the site will be divided into two phases, with most of the site coming online at the same time. The hospital building will take the longest time to construct, so it will begin with phase one along with the medical office building, fitness center, community space, education facility, surgical center, retail, and interior site circulation for both pedestrians and vehicles.  The complete buildout of the site will bring the planned office space, incubator and accelerator spaces, daycare, and retail, along with additional outdoor amenities. These components will have shorter construction times, starting after the hospital, but are expected to finish at the same time as the hospital. Landscaping buildout will align with buildout of adjacent programs. The project has undergone multiple revisions and recently acquired the final portion of the property from the City of Chicago for $5 million. The $600 million project will now move on to the Committee on Zoning and full City Council. Demolition permits were recently issued, and work is planned to begin this month. After that planned remediation will begin. New construction is expected to commence in 2023 with completion expected in 2026. ",Little Village,0.0
Demo permits issued for Focal Point Community Campus,"Demolition permits have been issued for the existing structures at the proposed Focal Point Community Campus. Addressed at 3345 W. 31st St, the three masonry structures will be replaced by an extensive campus planned by not-for-profit developer Chicago Southwest Development Corporation. The entire project will span 30 acres, fronting W. 31st St to the north and S. Kedzie Ave to the east. The Little Village site will hold a new home for Saint Anthony Hospital, retail, housing, and sports fields. With a design from architecture firm HDR, the latest plan, presented to the Committee on Design in September 2021, encompasses nearly one million square feet of development built in phases. The main structure will be the new hospital tower, rising 12 stories. Rising 206 feet, the structure will house 151 beds for the new Saint Anthony Hospital and will connect to a seven-story outpatient facility via a skybridge. An interconnected structure will hold three floors of parking topped by athletic fields on the roof. The overall development will also deliver retail space, affordable housing, offices, a business incubator, a community center, a daycare facility, a trade school, and an outdoor amphitheater. The community campus will link to the surrounding community via bike and pedestrian connections to the planned El Paseo rails-to-trail project. In the works for over 10 years, the project has undergone multiple revisions and recently acquired the property from the City of Chicago for $5 million. The overall $600 million project will still require approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council. If approvals proceed as planned, new construction is planned for 2023 and completion expected in 2026. ",Little Village,0.0
Massive mixed-use Saint Anthony Hospital campus inches forward,"The design of a massive mixed-use campus that includes a new home for Saint Anthony Hospital is starting to take shape in Little Village. Known as the Focal Point Community Campus, the 30-acre project is slated for 3201 W. 31st Street—a vacant parcel once home to the former Washburne Trade School. Not-for-profit developer Chicago Southwest Development Corporation presented updated plans for the site this week at the second meeting of the Chicago Committee on Design. Although the committee lacks the power to approve or block the project, it can make recommendations and provide advisory guidance to the development team and city planners. The somewhat rough renderings—created by architecture firm HDR—suggest the design is likely to continue to evolve. The latest proposal calls for nearly one million square feet of development built in phases. The tallest hospital building tops out at 12 stories (206 feet) and houses 151 beds for Saint Anthony's. It connects to a seven-story outpatient facility and a three-level parking garage capped by baseball and soccer fields. The project also includes new retail space, affordable housing units, offices, a business incubator, a community center, a daycare facility, a trade school, an outdoor amphitheater, and bike and pedestrians connections to the planned El Paseo rails-to-trail project.  The development has been in the works for 10 years and achieved a key milestone in April when the Chicago City Council signed off on a measure to sell the city-owned property to the Focal Point team for $5 million. The estimated $600 million project still requires zoning approval from the city. The developers hope to begin construction in 2023 and welcome patients in 2026—if approvals go as planned.

Developer shares renderings for 2429 W. Fullerton,"Developer SNS Realty Group has shared new renderings of their residential development at 2429 W. Fullerton. Located at the southeastern corner of W. Fullerton Ave and N. Campbell Ave, the site is currently a vacant lot. Designed by Red Architects, the proposal is an all-residential building due to the lack of demand for commercial space and already-empty spaces nearby. Rising five floors, the building will include 38 residential units, split into 20 one-beds, 17 two-beds, and one three-bedroom apartment. As part of the proposal, 8 of the units will be set aside as affordable. Residents will have access to 19 car parking spaces and a dedicated bike room for 38 bicycles. The ground floor will have a community room space overlooking the corner of W. Fullerton Ave and N. Campbell Ave, with a three-bed apartment and a two-bed apartment finishing out the W. Fullerton Ave street frontage. The residential entry will face N. Campbell Ave with the bike room accessed from the lobby. Parking is located at the back of the site. Changes to the project include reducing the building height by lowering floor heights and parapet wall, changing the material of the fifth floor exterior to minimize its appearance, recessing the northeast corner to increase alley visibility, added landscaping trays to the roof, using a lighter brick color, adding a masonry and iron wall to screen parking along N. Campbell Ave, adding parking lot gates, and relocating the roof deck to the north side and making it smaller.  To allow for the development, SNS Realty Group is requesting a zoning change from B3-1 to B2-3. The developers are still looking to gain approval from the alderman, with another 6-9 months expected for the formal rezoning and variance process afterwards. Assuming all approvals go to plan, construction will take a year, putting the project at completion around Spring 2025. ",Logan Square,0.0

Developer plans residential at 1805 N. Campbell,"Local developer CKG Realty Group has proposed a residential development at 1805 N. Campbell. Located on the northeast corner of N. Campbell Ave and W. Bloomingdale Ave, the project site is currently home to a two-story residential building.  Presenting four different options, the developer envisioned either a four or five-story building with or without parking.  The first option, planned as a five-story building, would have 32 residential units, with 6 of them affordable, and 9 parking spaces. Option 2 would also be a five-story building, but would not include parking, resulting in an increase of the unit count to 35 with 7 of them as affordable.  The third scheme would be a four-story building with 28 units, 6 of them affordable, and 9 parking spaces. The final option would also be a four-story building with the lack of parking resulting in an increase of units to 31 with 6 of them set aside as affordable. Across all options, the building would have four residential units on the ground floor facing W. Bloomingdale Ave with the residential entry along N. Campbell Ave at the middle of the building. The back portion of the ground floor would either have nine parking spaces or three additional residential units.  The second through fourth floors of each option would have eight units per floor split into four two-beds and four one-beds. For the five-story buildings, the fifth floor would have four three-bedroom units.   The project will need to rezone the site from M1-1 to B2-3 to allow for the scope of the development.

Encuentro Square celebrates groundbreaking,"Development partners and elected officials gathered yesterday to celebrate the groundbreaking of Encuentro Square, a two-building, multifamily development in Logan Square at 3759 W. Cortland St. and 1844 N. Ridgeway Ave., at the western edge of the 606 Trail. Developed by Latin United Community Housing Association (LUCHA) and Evergreen Real Estate Group, the property was the site of the former Magid Glove factory. “Gentrification pressure in the Logan Square community has resulted in a significant reduction in naturally occurring affordable housing stock for the area, leading to changes in demographics that have accelerated over the past decade with the development of the 606 Trail,” said DOH Acting Commissioner Jim R. Horan. “Encuentro Square puts a stake in the ground in a highly visible location that confirms the City’s commitment to these 89 households being able to call Logan Square home.” Designed by Canopy / architecture + design, the development will provide 89 affordable units at or below 60% of AMI. Encuentro Square’s amenities will include a community services lobby and community room, a teaching kitchen, on-site management offices, bike storage, a children’s room, and lounge and courtyard. Community support services will also be available to tenants, including home-based head start in partnership with the Children’s Place Association, as well as financial training and counseling. 70 of the 89 total units are family-sized units (two-bedrooms or larger). Fifty-five units will benefit from long-term project-based rental assistance administered by the CHA, of which 44 are family-sized units. “CHA is proud to be a key partner in Encuentro Square, a project that demonstrates what can be accomplished when stakeholders from the public and private sectors join together to ensure affordable housing in rapidly gentrifying communities like Logan Square. Thanks to CHA’s funding support, 55 of the 89 families in these new buildings will have the security of long-term housing stability. With this rental assistance, families who live in Logan Square – and who love Logan Square – can remain in this community for years to come,” said CHA CEO Tracey Scott. Encuentro Square is being funded with approximately $32,300,000 in equity generated by City- sourced Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, $1,666,400 in funds generated by state tax credits from the City’s donation of the project property, $9,000,000 in City-sourced TIF funds, $14,827,230 in City-sourced loan funds, and private mortgage debt of $6,780,000, among other sources. ""Encuentro Square is the culmination of many years of planning and hard work by dozens of public and private entities. Evergreen is proud to make this community vision a reality and provide critical affordable housing for families living near the western terminus of the 606 Trail,"" said David Block, Director of Development at Evergreen Real Estate Group. ""LUCHA is incredibly proud to continue to build on our more than 40-year history of providing affordable housing to our community. We look forward to adding these units to the stock of permanently affordable housing, turning a vacant lot not just into housing, but into homes,” said Lissette Castaneda, Executive Director at LUCHA. In relation to but funded and implemented separately from the Encuentro Square development, the Chicago Park District will take ownership of a portion of the site that is to be redeveloped for use as a public park that will connect with the 606 Trail. With Leopardo Companies serving as the general contractor, construction has begun on the taller structure at 1844 N. Ridgeway, with permits issued for the second building at 3759 W. Cortland as well.

City Council approves funding for Congress Theater,"The City Council has approved the allocation of $27 million in TIF funding to support the redevelopment of the long-vacant Congress Theater. Located at 2135 N. Milwaukee, the historic Congress Theater sits at the corner of N Milwaukee Avenue and N Rockwell Street. Baum Revision has taken over as the developer, replacing previous developers who failed to move the project forward. Designed by Woodhouse Tinucci Architects, the plan for the rehabilitation includes a full historic restoration to the theater, retail, and housing space. Work will restore the existing finishes without altering the layout or organization of rooms within the structure. The renovation will upgrade all of the mechanicals of the structure, including ventilation, electrical, plumbing, and the roof. New windows will be installed that will match the character of the original windows. Beyond the theater, the property fronts the street with 13,000 square feet of retail space and two levels of residential space. Storefronts will be renovated and made to match the original storefront layouts. 16 apartments, 14 of them affordable, will be included in the Milwaukee Ave building including studio, one-bed, and two-bedroom units. No parking will be included within the development. The $88 million plan will use the $27 million in TIF alongside other funding sources to finance the project. A key part of the city’s approval included the three-year extension of the TIF district, giving the developer more time before the TIF funding expires. With these final approvals secured, the development is ready to move forward with permitting and construction. A timeline for completion is currently unknown. ",Logan Square,0.0

Planned by Hibernian Development, the two-site proposal at 2354 and 2355 N. Washtenaw is currently occupied with a now-vacant, one-story credit union building and surface parking lot for the credit union.  With 360 Design Studio working on the design, 2354 N. Washtenaw Ave will offer 20 residential units and 2,000 square feet of retail space on the western site. With a mix of 19 two-bed units and one one-bed apartment, four units will be set aside as affordable. On the ground floor, the retail space will front W. Fullerton Ave, with the residential entry fronting N. Washtenaw Ave. The building will hold 18 car parking spaces in an interior garage, with 38 bike parking spaces also included.  Planned for the eastern parcel, 2355 N. Washtenaw Ave will offer 15 residential units and 1,550 square feet of retail space. With a mix of 14 two-bed units and one three-bed apartment, three units will be set aside as affordable. On the ground floor, the retail space will also front W. Fullerton Ave, with the residential entry fronting N. Washtenaw Ave. The building will hold 14 car parking spaces in an interior garage, with 20 bike parking spaces also included.  Both buildings will rise 67 feet, clad in face brick with stone accents and an aluminum cornice. Balconies will occupy the front corners of each building, with subsequent balconies built off the rear facades and overlooking N. Washtenaw Ave. The top floor of each building will setback 10 feet from W. Fullerton Ave, providing balconies to those fifth-floor units.  With City Council approval, the sites have been rezoned from B3-1 to B2-3. A timeline for construction has not been announced.

New developer proposes residential at 2429 W. Fullerton,"A new developer has come on board to propose a residential development at 2429 W. Fullerton. After a previous developer was unable to secure approval from the community, SNS Realty Group has come to the table with a new proposal for the site. Located at the southeastern corner of W. Fullerton Ave and N. Campbell Ave, the site is currently a vacant lot. Designed by Red Architects, the new proposal will be an all-residential building, citing the lack of demand for commercial space and already-empty spaces nearby. Rising five floors, the building will include 36 residential units, split into 18 one-beds and 18 two-beds. 7 units will be set aside as affordable. Residents will have access to 21 car parking spaces and a dedicated bike room for 39 bicycles. Rising 65 feet, the top floor of the building is setback significantly, holding a tenant amenity space and roof deck. To reduce the mass of the building, the ground floor has been sunk by a few feet, making the massing of the building appear closer to a four-story building. The ground floor will face W. Fullerton Ave with residential units, while the parking will be located behind that. The design will setback the upper residential floors 30 feet from its rear property line, setting it apart from the previously denied proposals.  To allow for the development, SNS Realty Group is requesting a zoning change from B3-1 to B2-3. The developers expect the development process to take 3-6 months for the aldermanic process, with another 6-9 months expected for the formal rezoning and variance process. Assuming all approvals go to plan, construction will take a year, putting the project at completion in about 2 years from now. ",Logan Square,0.0
Full building permit issued for 2934 W. Medill,"A full building permit has been issued for a new residential building at 2934 W. Medill. Located on the site of Project Logan, the new development will replace a set of one-story commercial buildings well known as a popular destination for graffiti art. Originally proposed in December 2020, the project’s developer Wilmot Properties has faced some pushback from residents and revised the project as a result. With a design by locally based Hanna Architects, the project will deliver 56 residential units in a five-story building. Clad with a masonry design, the building will offer exclusively two-bedroom apartments featuring balconies in every unit. As part of the revision process, the parking count has been reduced from 56 down to 46 spaces.   To work with the alderman’s office and to appease the community, the developer has come to an agreement with Project Logan that they will own the east- and north-facing walls in perpetuity according to a previous Block Club Chicago article. The development will also set aside 20% of the units as affordable housing. With the issuance of the full building permit, general contractor Wilmot Construction can begin work on the new building. A timeline for construction has not been announced.  ",Logan Square,0.0
Landmarks approves updated plan for 2618 N. Milwaukee,"The Permit Review Committee has approved a revised redevelopment plan for the Grace Furniture building at 2618 N. Milwaukee. Located just north of Logan Square Park, the building sits within the Logan Square Boulevards District. Built in 1914 as a storage warehouse, the building’s prominent side elevation was demolished in 2017, with the steel frame left exposed and infilled with plywood. Developers Bluestar Properties and Marc Realty secured approval to turn the structure into a boutique hotel back in 2020, and now are back to consider a proposal that would reoccupy the building with a gym. According to Block Club Chicago, Logan Square Athletic Club would be the anchor tenant, operating the gym under the Chicago Athletic Club brand. With K2 Studio continuing as the architects for the revised scheme, the proposal will include a new brick facade with 28 window openings in seven bays that match the existing structural grid. Metal panels will act as spandrels with extra detailing as an added touch. A new stair and elevator core will be added at the back of the building with a partial sixth floor addition that will have rooftop access to an outdoor deck. The existing billboard structure will be used as a trellis. The previous design called for new windows on the Milwaukee Ave facade to accommodate access to light for the hotel rooms. In the updated design, the existing smaller set of eight windows will be retained in their current configuration. The terracotta surround on the ground floor and the terracotta border on the entire facade will be restored. With approval from the Permit Review Committee, the development can move forward with securing local approvals within the 35th Ward before beginning construction. Permits for construction have not been filed or issued and a timeline for construction is currently unknown.  ",Logan Square,0.0
Developer revises plan for two buildings at Fullerton/Washtenaw,"Hibernian Development is coming back to the community with a revised plan for their two-building project at the intersection of Fullerton and Washtenaw. Located at 2354 and 2355 N. Washtenaw Ave, the two-site proposal is currently occupied with a now-vacant, one-story credit union building and surface parking lot for the credit union.  With 360 Design Studio working on the design, 2354 N. Washtenaw Ave will offer 20 residential units and 2,000 square feet of retail space on the western site. With a mix of 19 two-bed units and one one-bed apartment, four units will be set aside as affordable. On the ground floor, the retail space will front W. Fullerton Ave, with the residential entry fronting N. Washtenaw Ave. The building will hold 18 car parking spaces in an interior garage, with 38 bike parking spaces also included.  Planned for the eastern parcel, 2355 N. Washtenaw Ave will offer 15 residential units and 1,550 square feet of retail space. With a mix of 14 two-bed units and one three-bed apartment, three units will be set aside as affordable. On the ground floor, the retail space will also front W. Fullerton Ave, with the residential entry fronting N. Washtenaw Ave. The building will hold 14 car parking spaces in an interior garage, with 20 bike parking spaces also included.  Both buildings will rise 67 feet, clad in face brick with stone accents and an aluminum cornice. Balconies will occupy the front corners of each building, with subsequent balconies built off the rear facades and overlooking N. Washtenaw Ave. The top floor of each building will setback 10 feet from W. Fullerton Ave, providing balconies to those fifth-floor units.  Originally proposed back in February, the developers initially proposed two plans for the pair of sites. The first plan would have called for 15 units at 2354 N. Washtenaw and 12 apartments at 2355 N. Washtenaw. The second version would have produced 28 apartments at 2354 N. Washtenaw and 20 units at 2355 N. Washtenaw.  The developers are seeking a rezoning of the sites from B3-1 to B2-3, with approvals needed from alderman Daniel La Spata, the Committee on Zoning and City Council. A timeline for the project has not been announced. ",Logan Square,1.0
Revised plan proposed for Hollander Building,"Developer GW Properties has come back to the community to propose a new plan for the rehabilitation of the Hollander Building. Located at 2422 N. Milwaukee, the building stands just north of the intersection of N. Milwaukee Ave and W. Fullerton Ave. The rear of the Hollander Building turns to front W. Fullerton Ave, with the rest of the site backing up against the public alley and Blue Line CTA L tracks. Designed by NORR, the updated plan would rehabilitate the Hollander Building and build a new five-story addition that will replace an existing parking lot and one-story structure. Rising 74 feet, the project would add 4,500 square feet of retail to the base of the Hollander Building and there will be 5,000 square feet of retail in the new addition. According to the developers, Guidepost Montessori and a salon have already signed onto the project. On the upper floors, the project will include 57 apartments. Expected to be rented at market-rate, the units will be split into 15 studios, 33 one-beds, and 9 two-beds. The developers have committed to providing 15% of the units as affordable. Residential tenants will have access to bike storage as well as 15 parking spaces. The top floor will have private terraces for two units as well as a shared terrace and interior flex space for residents.  The site has gone through multiple zoning changes since its first version, with an approved plan from 2019 calling for a five-story addition to convert the building into offices, retail, and commercial space. In 2021, the developers came back to remove the addition, use the existing one-story building as an extension of the ground floor commercial space, and put 9 apartments and office space into the Hollander Building.  According to Block Club Chicago, the developers scrapped the plan due to skyrocketing construction costs and supply shortages making the development no longer leasable.  The plan is awaiting input from the community and a decision from local alderman Daniel La Spata. Once support is secured, the plan will need approval for a zoning change.  ",Logan Square,0.0
Landmarks approves Congress Theater redevelopment,"The Permit Review Committee has approved the Congress Theater redevelopment. Located at 2135 N Milwaukee, the historic Congress Theater sits at the corner of N Milwaukee Avenue and N Rockwell Street. Baum Revision has taken over as the developer, replacing the previous developer who couldn’t finance the project.  Designed by Woodhouse Tinucci Architects, the plan for the rehabilitation remains unchanged from the previous ownership, including a full historic restoration to the theater, retail, and housing space. Work will restore the existing finishes without altering the layout or organization of rooms within the structure. The renovation will upgrade all of the mechanicals of the structure, including ventilation, electrical, plumbing, and the roof. New windows will be installed that will match the character of the original windows. Beyond the theater, the property fronts the street with ground floor retail and two levels of residential space. Storefronts will be renovated and made to match the original storefront layouts. 16 affordable apartments will be included in the Milwaukee Ave building including studio, one-bed, and two-bedroom units. No parking will be included within the development. Expected to cost a total of $70.4 million, the project will be funded with $13.3 million in equity, $28 million in debt, $9 million in historic tax credits, $5.5 million in a deferred developer fee, and the tentatively approved $20 million in TIF. The project costs include $12.8 million for the acquisition, with $57.5 million for the construction and soft costs.  The theater is already a Chicago landmark and the developer plans to seek its designation to the National Register of Historic Places. With approval from the Permit Review Committee, the project is ready to move forward pending the securing of TIF assistance which was approved by the Community Development Commission in March 2022 and awaits approval from City Council.  ",Logan Square,1.0
City Council approves funding for Encuentro Square,"The City Council has approved city funding for Encuentro Square, an all-affordable residential development at 1805 N. Hamlin Ave. Located just west of the 606 trail terminus, the site is the former Magid Glove factory. The project is being developed by Latin United Community Housing Association (LUCHA) and Evergreen Real Estate Group. Split into two phases, the Encuentro Square redevelopment will deliver a total of 187 mixed-income rental units across three buildings. With a design by Canopy Architecture & Design, the first phase will see the buildout of the first two buildings. Rising six stories, the eastern building will offer 57 apartments, divided into 13 one-beds, 35 two-beds, and nine three-beds. The western building, rising four floors, will hold 32 units made up of six one-beds, 12 two-beds, and 14 three-beds. All units will be affordable up to 60% AMI. Rising 69 feet and 50 feet tall respectively, the buildings will host a set of residential amenities and community spaces. Spaces will include a community room, teaching kitchen, computer room, office suite, bike room, lounge, children’s room, and exterior terrace. 56 parking spaces will be included in the first phase. The massing and facade of each building is designed to complement each other with similar shaping, fenestration, and facade materials.  The buildings are being developed with financial assistance from the City of Chicago via the Chicago Department of Housing. As part of this approval, the City Council has approved the issuance of multi-family housing revenue bonds totaling $19.5 million for the project. While developers are also expecting TIF assistance, this specific approval does not include those expected TIF funds. The first phase is expected to cost approximately $49.3 million.  The southern end of the site will become a new public park to link to the terminus of the 606 trail. As of now the park space is under remediation along with the rest of the site. Once work is done, the Chicago Park District will engage in a community process to determine how the park should be developed. At that time they will seek funding sources to build out the park.  After approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council, the project site has been rezoned from M1-1 and M1-2 to RM-6 with a final Planned Development designation. With the current financing approval, the developers are just waiting on City Council approval of $9 million in TIF and the land sale that has already been cleared by the Community Development Commission. Closing and groundbreaking is expected for August 2022.

12-story apartment building planned at Wabash and Cermak,"In the South Loop, developer Draper & Kramer is seeking city approval for a 12-story apartment project near McCormick Place at the northeast corner of Wabash Avenue and Cermak Road. If approved, the 150-foot-tall building will rise just south of the developer's 24-story Aspire apartments, which opened in 2020. The proposal replaces a vacant lot that was previously occupied by a muffler shop and used as a staging area during the construction of Aspire. According to a zoning application filed with the city, the upcoming structure would contain 150 rental units (including 15 on-site affordable units), ground-floor retail, and parking for 74 cars. Like its Aspire neighbor to the north, the design of the project comes from architecture firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz.  In 2015, Draper & Kramer originally pitched—and received approval for—a seven-story, 144-room hotel for the prominent corner parcel. Since that time, the blocks surrounding McCormick Place have welcome several notable new developments. In addition to Aspire, other prominent projects in the area include the Wintrust Arena, the 1,205-room Marriott Marquis, and the 466-room Hiltons at McCormick Place Hotel. Draper & Kramer declined to comment on the recent zoning application.

City announces winner of Pershing Road RFP,"A $121 million project that includes mixed-income housing, commercial offices and retail space was announced as the winner of a Chicago Department of Planning and Development Request for Proposals to redevelop a historic city-owned property in McKinley Park. The project site at 1769 W. Pershing measures approximately 6.5 acres. Planned by IBT Group LLC, the project will repurpose a vacant 571,000-square-foot warehouse known as the Quartermaster Depot, which was built in 1918 for the U.S. Army. The six-story structure, featuring 90,000-square-foot floor plates and located within McKinley Park’s Central Manufacturing District complex, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by Epstein, the rehab will remove a center section of the building to create two partially detached structures with a shared interior courtyard. One structure will include 120 mixed-income apartments ranging from studios to three-bedroom units. The other will become a 200,445-square-foot innovative office hub and technology incubator. Approximately 120 parking spaces and rooftop amenities will serve tenants and visitors of both structures. The facade and other historic elements of the complex will be preserved and restored. The eastern portion of the site, which currently contains a one-story City maintenance facility, will be redeveloped as a 50,000-square-foot grocery store. Approximately 130 parking spaces will be available for store patrons and workers. ""The Pershing Road project is an example of how innovative thinking and design can breathe new life into our historic spaces, while expanding affordable housing opportunities for Chicagoans,"" Mayor Brandon Johnson said. ""I look forward to the potential this project holds to revitalize the McKinley Park community, including plans for mixed-income housing, a grocery store, and office space to benefit neighbors and create jobs.""  The development site is valued at approximately $6.7 million, minus environmental remediation costs that are yet to be determined. The developer’s anticipated request for city support could include up to $25 million in TIF funding pending formal review and approval processes that include City Council review.

Developers present proposals for Pershing RFP,"Three competing developer teams have presented their proposals to the community for the redevelopment of city-owned property at 1769 W. Pershing. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development issued an RFP back in July 2022, seeking proposals to rehab the vacant, city-owned warehouse. Located in McKinley Park’s historic Central Manufacturing District, the RFP has an option to include an adjacent 3.2-acre site for new construction.  Here is a breakdown of each proposal:   IBT Group LLC IBT Group LLC is proposing to renovate the historic warehouse building with 200,000 square feet of flexible office space and 120 residential units. Opting to include Site B, the team would redevelop that site with a one-story 50,000-square foot retail building that they are targeting for a grocery tenant.  The developer is partnering with Inherent L3C for the housing portion and has tapped Epstein and Site Design Group for the design, with ARCO Murray and Englewood Construction on deck for building the project. The design would carve out the center of the building to allow for units and office space to access light, with the exterior of the building preserved. The roof will have an activated roof deck complete with educational space, solar power generation, community-based programming and a ½ mile running track.   The $120 million development would be funded with $18-30 million in C-PACE funding, $12-24 million in federal historic tax credits, $3 million in state historic tax credits, $6-12 million federal grants, $12-18 million in equity, and $39-63 million in debt that is expected to include some TIF funding.   Outpost Studios LLC Outpost Studios LLC is planning to convert the existing warehouse building into studio space for movies, TV shows, commercials, and music. The creative campus will include a new production studio on Site B and add 40 residential units to the rooftop of the warehouse building. At the ground floor, a large public food hall will face W. Pershing Rd. The project team, led by Cacciatore Capital, includes Just Don, Chicago Media Angels, and Morgan Stanley, with Holabird & Root leading the design. Walsh Construction would serve as the general contractor for the project.  The design calls for a ground floor food hall and flex space, with parking at the back. Set storage, set construction, wardrobe storage and wardrobe workshop spaces will be located on the second floor. The upper floors will hold the planned studios, with the aforementioned rooftop housing topping off the building. The 40 residential units will comply with the city’s ARO requirements. The $110 million project would be funded with $50 million in debt, $36 million in equity, $12 million in TIF funding, and $10 million in tax credits.   Pershing Road Studios Planned by LG Development and KMW Communities, Pershing Road Studios would build large sound stages on the site in collaboration with Cinelease Studios. With a design from Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the site will become home to six sound stages, back-of-house space for production staff, and 13,000 square feet of community amenity space. The back portion of the warehouse would be demolished to make room for two of the sound stages, with the leftover historic warehouse making up an L-shape. These elevations would be repaired and restored. The street-facing wing will have 13,000 square feet of space set aside for a community amenity space on the ground floor, with 100 car parking spaces on the second and third floors above.  The lower five floors of the southern wing will hold all of the back-of-house spaces for the productions, including production offices, props, wardrobe, lighting, storage, and catering. The top floors of the leftover warehouse building will be available as 45,000 square feet of flex space that could be leased to outside office tenants or accommodate an expansion of the production facility. The plan calls for the remaining four sound stages to be built on Site B, with 300 surface parking spaces located at the back of the site. – With each developer presenting their plans, DPD is seeking community feedback in the next couple of weeks. The final selection is expected in early April, upon which the chosen developer will begin a city review process that will include a Planned Development application for the project.  ",McKinley Park,1.0
DPD announces Pershing Road RFP finalists,"The Chicago Department of Planning and Development has announced the three finalists for their Pershing Road RFP. Issued back in July 2022, the RFP is seeking to rehab a vacant, city-owned warehouse at 1769 W. Pershing. Located in McKinley Park’s historic Central Manufacturing District, the RFP has an option to include an adjacent 3.2-acre site for new construction.  The RFP’s goals include the creation of a mix of private uses that foster additional neighborhood economic investment and enhance employment options for area residents, among other neighborhood needs. With five submissions by private developers, the proposals were evaluated by an RFP selection team in December 2022 and three of the five responses were short-listed for additional community and City review.  Here are the three short-listed proposals: IBT Group LLC The first finalist is IBT Group LLC, who propose to rehab the vacant warehouse at 1769 W. Pershing into 120 units of mixed-income housing and 200,000 square feet of commercial offices, lab space, and retail space. The building would be served by 120 exterior car parking spaces. The developers are also looking to take advantage of the adjacent 3.2-acre property by redeveloping it with a 50,000-square-foot retail building and 132 parking spaces. The proposal is expected to cost $121 million. LG Pershing Sound Studios LLC Proposed by LG Pershing Sound Studios LLC, the second finalist would rehab the warehouse at 1769 W. Pershing into 114,000 square feet of commercial offices, 40,000 square feet of movie studio space, and 13,500 square feet of retail space. The scheme would include indoor parking for 100 cars and exterior parking for 300 cars and 25 semi-trucks. The 3.2-acre adjacent site would be redeveloped with 79,200 square feet of movie studio space. This project would cost $95.1 million. Quartermaster Outpost Studio LLC The third finalist is Quartermaster Outpost Studio LLC, who would rehab the warehouse at 1769 W. Pershing into approximately 425,000 square feet of mixed-use business space, with an additional floor added for 40 mixed-income residential units. Exterior parking for 123 cars would be provided. Their plan for the 3.2-acre site would be the development of a 75,000-square-foot movie studio space and exterior parking. This final scheme would cost $90 million. -- The proposals will be presented for public consideration in February 2023 through presentations, surveys and other opportunities to provide feedback.

Adaptive reuse plan for historic McKinley Park warehouses progresses,"Near McKinley Park, a pair of former warehouses are one step closer to becoming a new mixed-use, mixed-income complex after winning the support of the Chicago Plan Commission by an unusually tight margin.  In discussion for more than two years, the proposal from New York-based developer Code RE Partners, Inc. and non-profit Hispanic Housing Development Corporation will breathe new life into the six-story buildings located just south of McKinley Park proper. The property at 2159 W. Pershing Road would be converted into 120 affordable apartments priced at 30 to 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI) and would be rebranded as the ""Parkview Lofts.""  The adjacent building at 2139 W. Pershing Road would be converted into ""Parkview Commerce,"" a mixed-use development with commercial space for small businesses on the first, second, and third floors plus 39 units of market-rate housing on levels four through six. The structures are both located in the southwest side's historic Central Manufacturing District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and have an orange rating in the Chicago Historic Resources Survey. The plan also includes a new landscaped courtyard located between the two former warehouses and 141 parking spaces in a ground-floor garage and a surface lot behind the Parkview Commerce building.  The design of the adaptive reuse plan comes from Chicago's FitzGerald Associates Architects, and Power Construction will serve as general contractor. The developers estimate the cost of the project at $41 million and have already secured low-income housing tax credits to help finance the work. City officials praised the proposal for restoring historically significant buildings and bringing much-need affordable housing to a transit-served location in a gentrifying neighborhood, but also raised health-related concerns due to the site's proximity to heavy industry, including an active asphalt plant to the south.  Although the development team presented plans for a two-stage air filtration system that would exceed all requirements, the discussion highlighted a larger issue of how pollution disproportionally impacts Chicago's lower-income residents and communities of color.  Ald. George Cardenas (12th), whose ward includes the properties, defended his support for the Pershing Road proposal. ""This is my second year with this plan, trying to create affordable housing, and we're here today because it's been vetted and re-vetted,"" said the elected official. ""...not to approve this would be a slap in the face to many of the families that are looking to stay in the neighborhood."" After spending more than two hours reviewing and debating the proposal, the Chicago Plan Commission issued an unusual split decision and approved the project by a relatively tight 7 - 4 margin. The redevelopment plan for 2139 and 2159 W. Pershing Road will now go before the Committee on Zoning and full Chicago City Council for final approval.  ",McKinley Park,0.0
Transit-oriented development headed to McKinley Park,"While transit-oriented development has spread like wildfire around CTA lines on the North Side, TOD mania has been slow to gain traction on the city's South and West sides. That could soon change in McKinley Park where plans are advancing to bring a transit-oriented project to a vacant lot near the 35th Street CTA Orange Line stop. Archer Homes Developments Inc. recently filed a zoning application to rezone the parcel at 3595 S. Archer Avenue from C1-2 to B2-3. If approved by the city, the rezoning measure would clear a path for a new four-story building with a commercial space and two live-work units on the ground floor and 27 dwelling units on the upper floors. Designed by Thomas Architects, the plan would still provide on-site parking for 23 cars and 36 bicycles. The existing flagpole and historical marker dedicated to early Chicago explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet will remain at the corner of Archer Avenue and Leavitt Street.  Redeveloping the area's vacant lots near the Ashland and 35th/Archer CTA stops into transit-oriented, multifamily developments is identified as a key component of the 2021 McKinley Park neighborhood plan.

Permits issued for 871 N. Franklin at North Union,"Permits have been issued to begin the adaptive reuse of 871 N. Franklin. As part of the North Union mega development planned by JDL Development, the structure stands at the southeast corner of W. Locust St and N. Franklin St. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the adaptive reuse will convert the three-story brick building into a mixed-use building with a two-story addition. Topping out at 75 feet, the new addition will be clad in vertical ribbed metal panels with metal panel spandrels and new aluminum windows that are aligned with the existing building’s arrangement of punched window openings. On the interior, the ground floor will be mostly occupied by retail space, fronting N. Franklin St, W. Locust St, and the new park to the east. The residential lobby will face N. Franklin St and have amenity space included next to it. The upper four floors of the building will have the planned 44 residential units.  The design of 871 N. Franklin recently underwent some changes, including the removal of the east addition that was planned. While the east facade will still be rebuilt, it will stay in line with where the current facade is. Minor adjustments were made to the building’s interior layout and its upper setbacks were reduced on the new floors.  Permits issued so far will allow general contractor Power Construction to remove and replace windows, renovate the facade, perform interior demolition, and install new structural footings, walls, and stairs.

Zoning application filed for slender tower at 1565 N. Clybourn,"New York-based developer The Georgetown Company has submitted a rezoning application for their proposed mixed-use tower at 1565 N. Clybourn. Located at the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Halsted St, the new development will replace the retail structure that formerly held the Bank of America branch. The developer owns the four-story parking garage and the retail structure with Design Within Reach and will retain both of those structures as part of the development. With bKL Architecture on board for the design, the team sought to create something special and unique for the prominent gateway site for this area. The new mixed-use tower will rise with a very slender massing, tapering at the ends to create a unique profile. The tower’s glass and metal facade will come down to the ground without a large parking podium, meeting the ground in an elegant and pedestrian-friendly way. The facade switches to a masonry expression at the base with punched window openings to relate to the pedestrian scale. Rising 37 stories, the 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 residential units, with 79 of them set aside as affordable. The unit mix is still in flux, but will include a mix of studios, convertibles, one-beds, and two-beds. The ground floor will front N. Clybourn Ave with 2,500 square feet of retail space, with the residential entry facing back to the internal drive and north towards the pedestrian plaza designed by Confluence. Amenity space will be located on the third floor with an outdoor cutout in the building massing as well as rooftop amenities on the 37th floor which will include an outdoor pool. In regard to parking, the new building will have no new car parking spaces but will include 396 bike parking spaces on the third floor. The existing parking garage behind the new construction has 158 parking spaces. The developer plans to make 70 of them available to residents, 73 available for retail parking, and 15 spaces for employees. An internal private drive that currently exists will remain for internal circulation as well as drop off and loading. During a recent community meeting, some neighbors expressed concern over congestion in the neighborhood and the parking count for the project. The development team explained that the project’s status as a transit-served location with its proximity to the North/Clybourn L stop and CTA bus stops indicate a lower demand for parking. The development team said they are confident that the proposed parking ratio will sufficiently serve the residents and pointed out DPD’s encouragement to reduce parking near transit as part of their latest TOD ordinances. While they are at the beginning of the process, the developer is looking to rezone the site from its existing PD to B3-5 and then reinstate the Planned Development. The proposal needs approvals from Alderman Hopkins, the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. If approvals move forward according to plan, construction could begin in early 2025 with a 20–22-month construction timeline.  ",Near North,0.0
Urbanize tours 868 N. Wells at North Union,"Urbanize has visited the construction site of 868 N. Wells, the latest residential tower at North Union. Planned by JDL Development, the building occupies a rectangular site along N. Wells St stretching from W. Chestnut St to W. Locust St. With a design by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, 868 N. Wells will stand 26 floors high with 411 rental units and 12,000 square feet of retail space. Touring with Power Construction and JDL Development, the tour began by heading up to the top of the building to the 26th floor. Set to hold the building’s amenity spaces, the floor is enclosed but sits raw with construction equipment filling up the space. At the south end, the amenity space will open up to an outdoor deck that includes a rooftop pool. An outdoor dog run will be included on the west side of the amenity level. Going one floor down, the 25th level will be the top residential floor. The floor plate is fully enclosed with the glass facade and the first mechanical systems are being installed. Working our way down the building, our next stop was the two duplex apartments on the north end of the building’s 20th and 21st floors. The 21st floor shows the units fully framed with crews installing electrical wiring during our walkthrough. On the 20th floor, crews were closing up the walls with drywall.  Heading down the building, our next stop was the 12th floor, where drywall and paint has been completed, with cabinets going in for the units’ kitchens. Stopping at the third floor, we next saw some finished units that have kitchens and bathrooms installed as well as flooring and all other finishes. Residents will benefit from nine and a half feet high ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows that give unencumbered views of the city around it. On the ground floor, we walked through the future retail space that will face north and west into the future park space. As part of the first phase of North Union, the park will open at the same time as 868 N. Wells. JDL Development plans to begin pre-leasing at the end of April 2024, with Power Construction turning over the building in July 2024 for late-Summer 2024 move-ins. As construction wraps up on 868 N. Wells, JDL Development is pushing ahead on the rest of the first phase. The existing structure at 871 N. Franklin will get a two-story addition and be converted into apartments with another restaurant tenant planned for the retail space facing the park. 220 W. Chestnut already has its foundations and parking structure poured underground but its residential programming is still yet to be finalized. ",Near North,0.0

450-foot-tall slender tower proposed at 1565 N. Clybourn,"New York-based developer The Georgetown Company presented their plans for a proposed mixed-use tower at 1565 N. Clybourn to the local community last night. Located at the intersection of N. Clybourn Ave and N. Halsted St, the new development will replace the retail structure that formerly held the Bank of America branch. The developer owns the four-story parking garage and the retail structure with Design Within Reach and will retain both of those structures as part of the development. With bKL Architecture on board for the design, the team sought to create something special and unique for the prominent gateway site for this area. The new mixed-use tower will rise with a very slender massing, tapering at the ends to create a unique profile. The tower’s glass and metal facade will come down to the ground without a large parking podium, meeting the ground in an elegant and pedestrian-friendly way. The facade switches to a masonry expression at the base with punched window openings to relate to the pedestrian scale. Rising 37 stories, the 450-foot-tall structure will include 396 residential units, with 79 of them set aside as affordable. The unit mix is still in flux, but will include a mix of studios, convertibles, one-beds, and two-beds. The ground floor will front N. Clybourn Ave with 2,500 square feet of retail space, with the residential entry facing back to the internal drive and north towards the pedestrian plaza designed by Confluence. Amenity space will be located on the third floor with an outdoor cutout in the building massing as well as rooftop amenities on the 37th floor which will include an outdoor pool. In regard to parking, the new building will have no new car parking spaces but will include 396 bike parking spaces on the third floor. The existing parking garage behind the new construction has 158 parking spaces. The developer plans to make 70 of them available to residents, 73 available for retail parking, and 15 spaces for employees. An internal private drive that currently exists will remain for internal circulation as well as drop-off and loading. During the meeting, some neighbors expressed concern over congestion in the neighborhood and the parking count for the project. The development team explained that the project’s status as a transit-served location with its proximity to the North/Clybourn L stop and CTA bus stops indicate a lower demand for parking. The development team said they are confident that the proposed parking ratio will sufficiently serve the residents and pointed out DPD’s encouragement to reduce parking near transit as part of their latest TOD ordinances. Neighbors asked how the developer is expecting to fill the retail space considering the high vacancy in the area. The development team responded that with the replacement of the Bank of America space they are actually decreasing the amount of retail space in the area. While it is too early for specifics, the developer discussed the potential for a food and beverage retailer or coffee shop. A neighbor asked Alderman Hopkins if approaching this development would set a precedent for the area, and Hopkins responded that this wouldn’t set a precedent and his office would evaluate each project on its own merits as they come. Hopkins discussed some of his personal opinions about the development, mentioning how he liked the omission of a large parking podium and discussed embracing the trend of less parking in buildings as people shift to using more public transportation. He qualified the statement with the fact that they need to engage with CDOT and the private traffic engineer to address the potential traffic and congestion impacts and settle that before the project could move forward. While they are at the beginning of the process, the developer is looking to rezone the site from its existing PD to B3-5 and then reinstate the Planned Development. If approvals move forward according to plan, construction could begin in early 2025 with a 20–22-month construction timeline. The development needs approvals from Alderman Hopkins, the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. ",Near North,0.0
The Seng surpasses 50% sold,"Chicago-based Structured Development has announced The Seng, its new all-affordable condominium building on Chicago’s Near North Side, is more than halfway sold out, with 20 of its 34 below-market-rate homes closed or under contract. Resident move-ins are now underway. “Having over half of The Seng units under contract illustrates the demand for entry-level homeownership in gentrified neighborhoods like Lincoln Park,” said Mike Drew, co-founding principal of Structured Development. “We are proud to be a part of the buyer’s homeownership journey, particularly at a time when working Chicagoans are faced with rising expenses and a shrinking supply of attainable for-sale housing options. We look forward to welcoming additional residents to The Seng and helping them in their very first opportunity to build wealth through homeownership.” The Seng offers two-, three- and four-bedroom units for income-qualified households earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Buyers also must be preapproved for a traditional, FHA or VA loan and be certified through a homeownership program administered by the Chicago Housing Trust. Two-bedroom floor plans range from 824-868 square feet and are priced from $285,134; three-bedroom residences range from 988-1,186 square feet and are priced from $333,734; and four-bedroom homes range from 1,153-1,378 square feet and are priced from $374,696. The Chicago Housing Trust began accepting applications for The Seng earlier this year. Designed by GREC Architects, the five-story development at 869 W. Blackhawk is the first all-affordable condo building of its kind in Chicago. It is one of three new residential buildings in Structured Development’s Wendelin Park master plan, which includes a mix of affordable for-sale, co-living and market-rate rental housing oriented around a new publicly accessible park.  Residences at The Seng showcase large windows that fill the homes with natural light, 9-foot ceilings and modern finishes. Kitchens feature GE stainless steel appliances, Kohler chrome faucets, quartzite countertops and two-tone cabinetry. Condos also include in-unit laundry, and each comes with a deeded garage parking space. Accessible residences are included in the development’s unsold inventory. Shared amenities include a communal rooftop terrace with sweeping views of the city; secure bike storage; and a fitness center equipped with treadmills, stationary bikes, elliptical equipment and weights.

868 N. Wells tops out at North Union,"Urbanize has toured the construction site of the recently topped out 868 N. Wells at North Union. Planned by JDL Development, the building occupies a rectangular site along N. Wells St stretching from W. Chestnut St to W. Locust St. With a design by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, 868 N. Wells will stand 26 floors high with 411 rental units and 12,000 square feet of retail space. Touring with Power Construction and JDL Development, the tour began by heading up to the roof of the building where the final concrete slab had just been poured in the morning. Crews were finishing the concrete slab while the tower crane worked on removing the windscreens from around the structure. One floor below will be the 26th level, which is the highest accessible floor for residents and will be home to a full suite of amenities. On the south end will be an outdoor pool deck with seating, while the north end will have grilling stations and outdoor space. On the interior, there will be a club room, coworking space, and a demo kitchen. Currently, the floor is a forest of scaffolding and pole shores holding up the formwork for the concrete pour above. Working our way down the building, our stop on the 21st floor saw the clearing out of the pole shores and the first mechanical ducts and piping being installed. On the 17th floor, crews had begun skim coating the concrete ceilings that will measure nine and a half feet high and installing metal tracks for the framing.   On the 14th floor, workers were installing the track for the facade system, with window panels being installed just below on the 13th floor.  Heading down the building, framing has begun on floors with the facade installed and drywall is being installed as high up as the fourth floor. We stopped at the second floor to see the building’s fitness center that overlooks the park to the west.  At the base of the building, the planned 129 parking spaces are located in an underground garage. On the ground floor, retail space will be located both at the north and south ends of the building with an intention to bring in restaurant tenants to help develop a neighborhood feel for the development.  With the structure topped out and glass about halfway up, Power Construction is set to complete the building by July 2024. The park to the west of the tower is set to come online with the opening of 868 N. Wells.  To round out the block, the existing structure at 871 N. Franklin will get a two-story addition and be converted into apartments with another restaurant tenant planned for the retail space facing the park. 220 W.

CDC approves TIF for 520 W. Hobbie,"The Community Development Commission has approved TIF funding for mixed-income housing at 520 W. Hobbie. Located on a large site, the new development will occupy a site bound by W. Hobbie St to the south, N. Cleveland Ave to the east, and N. Cambridge Ave to the west. Developed as part of the Parkside of Old Town development, developers Holsten Real Estate Development Corporation and Cabrini Green LAC Community Development Corporation are collaborating on the project.  With Landon Bone Baker Architects and Brook Architecture collaborating on the design, this latest phase of the overall projects includes three buildings. Consisting of an eight-story midrise building and an assortment of townhomes and walk-up buildings, this development will deliver 93 new units, encompassing 35 CHA replacement units, 30 affordable units, 34 market rate units. Of the 93 apartments, there will be 9 studios, 28 one-beds, 27 two-beds, 21 three-beds, and 8 four-beds. 65 surface parking spaces will occupy the interior of the block.     Located along W. Hobbie St, LBBA is leading the charge on the 8-story midrise building. Set to rise 105 feet, the building will hold 69 of the aforementioned 93 units. Designed in a precast concrete system, faceted panels will be used to emphasize the base, with upper floors clad in white panels with a staggered window pattern to break up the facade. To reduce the bulk of the building, setbacks are incorporated into the upper floors that provide common and private rooftop decks for residents. The residential entry will sit at the southwest corner of the building and connect residents to the lobby as well as an adjacent community room and management offices. Fronting N. Cambridge Ave and N. Cleveland Ave, Brook Architecture has designed a series of three-story townhome and walk-up buildings. Divided into three buildings, they will provide the final 24 units for the site. Arranged to define the street edge, each building will also be built of precast concrete with varied heights and steps in elevations to break up the scale along each street.   The $65.78 million development will be funded with $16.4 million in TIF, $4.25 million in multifamily loan funds, $17 million in LIHTC equity, $4.6 million donation tax credit equity, $11.6 million from a first mortgage, $330,000 from a ComEd Energy grant, and $500,000 in the form of a deferred developer fee.

Urbanize tours Foundry at Wendelin Park,"Urbanize recently toured Foundry, the third and largest building under construction at Wendelin Park, a new mixed-use development in the Near North Side. Planned by White Oak Realty Partners in collaboration with Structured Development, the building fits into an overall three-building plan that is centered around a new public park on the larger site bound by W. Blackhawk, N. Dayton, and N. Kingsbury Streets. Foundry itself, designed by FitzGerald, is set to stand 299 feet while delivering 327 market-rate rental units. Touring with Structured Development and Power Construction, we began by heading up to the rooftop amenity deck on the 26th and 27th floors. Starting on the 26th floor, we walked around a deck that will have a pool and lots of outdoor space for residents that faces the city skyline to the south. An outdoor forum stair is part of the design, connecting the 26th and 27th floors while offering residents a spot to sit and look at the skyline above the protective glass walls. The 27th floor will have more indoor amenities in addition to that on the 26th level, as well as a hot tub at the top of the forum stair. Our next stop was the 5th floor, which is the first floor of units above the three floors of parking in the podium. Units have been built up with interior wall framing, drywall, and kitchen finishes already installed. Stepping out onto the roof deck, units will get private terraces with the remaining space planned for inaccessible green roofs. Select units on the upper floors will get projecting balconies. We finished the tour by walking through the ground floor, which will hold retail space at the corner of W. Blackhawk St and N. Kingsbury St. The residential entry will be midblock with the lobby spanning the entire width of the building east/west to connect to the Paseo and out to the future park space. The south end of the ground floor will hold mechanical spaces and the parking ramp up to the planned 142 parking spaces. The exterior wall has been mostly installed with interior finishes still on hold until progress on the tower above comes closer to completion. With Power Construction pushing ahead on the construction, the tower is scheduled for completion by the end of the year. With the construction plan not calling for any phased turnovers, the entire building will be available to residents to move in when it opens in December.  ",Near North,0.0
Urbanize tours Post Chicago at Wendelin Park,"Urbanize recently toured Post Chicago, a newly completed co-living residential development at Wendelin Park, a new mixed-use development in the Near North Side. Planned by Structured Development, the overall three-building, 487-unit community is centered around a new public park on the larger site that is bound by W. Blackhawk, N. Dayton, and N. Kingsbury Streets. Touring with Structured Development, we began in the residential lobby which overlooks W. Blackhawk St. The ground floor includes a full suite of amenities with a large coworking space that has large tables, working booths and tables all facing south to the future Wendelin Park. Residents will also have access to a fitness center, community room, and party lounge that also face the future park. The back of the floor plate is home to a parking garage for 43 cars which can be rented by tenants. Heading up into the building, we toured a series of the co-living apartments in the building. While there are 19 traditional apartments, we did not see them on the tour. The majority of the building is co-living apartments, operated by provider Tripalink. These 107 units are either 3-bed/2-bath or 4-bed/3-bath, and are rented by the room, so tenants would have roommates that they share the common spaces with.  Touring two model units, the apartments are designed with luxury finishes, in-unit laundry, and come fully furnished down to the silverware in the kitchen for residents. With a staggered layout, 4-bedroom units have two bedrooms up against the outside wall of the building that share a bathroom, and two units inset from the facade that have their own bathrooms. These inset bedrooms gain natural light through indents in the massing of the building which gives its blocky or serrated character. Heading down the building, we stopped on the second floor which houses the outdoor roof deck. Residents will be able to use the provided grilling stations, fire pits, and seating to look south towards the downtown skyline and look over the future Wendelin Park, the overall development’s last phase of the project.

City Council approves a revised plan for 330 W. Chestnut,"The Chicago City Council has approved revised plans for a residential development at 330 W. Chestnut. Located at the northeast corner of W. Chestnut St and N. Orleans St, the project site is currently a vacant lot adjacent to the CTA L tracks. Draper and Kramer is the developer behind the proposal. With FitzGerald in charge of the project’s design, the building will stand nine stories above street level. Rising 126 feet, it will include 128 luxury apartments, with a unit mix of 64 convertibles, 48 one-beds, and 16 two-beds. For the affordable requirement, 26 units will be set aside as affordable, including 13 convertibles, 10 one-beds, and three two-beds. As part of the redesign, the previously planned retail space has been eliminated. Parking for cars has been increased from 11 to 13 and the 80 bike parking spaces remain. On the ground floor, the redesign has moved the fitness center to the N. Orleans St frontage while expanding the parking to add two spaces and create an interior driveway that reduces the garage doors down to one main access point for cars. The bike parking spaces have been moved into a separate interior room rather than being in with the cars and the back of house spaces have been expanded to accommodate the building’s needs. On the facade, a series of balconies have been enclosed to make more interior space. At the southwest corner of the building, the slender massing used to have two bays of balconies, but the western bay has been enclosed to leave one bay of balconies. On the east facade, the southernmost bay was already enclosed, with the rest of them as open balconies. As part of the redesign, the second bay from the south end has been enclosed to create a larger interior space at that end. With approval from the City Council, the redesigned project is now fully approved. While a timeline for construction has not been announced, the $43 million development can move forward with securing financing and pulling permits. ",Near North,1.0
Post Chicago opens as Chicago’s largest co-living building,"Chicago developer Structured Development recently announced the opening of a model unit at Post Chicago, a 10-story, 431-bed co-living community. Located at 853 W. Blackhawk, the property will be operated by tech-driven co-living and residential property operator Tripalink, which provides quality and modernized housing solutions across the United States.  Designed for students, corporate transferees and others in search of flexible, turnkey housing, Post Chicago offers 107 residential units whose bedrooms – between two and four per unit – are fully furnished and individually leased, with rents starting at $1,375 per month. Co-living residents share access to a furnished living room, kitchen and in-unit washer/dryer, as well as a bathroom for those who don’t have their own ensuite bath. “Co-living at Post Chicago is a fun, affordable way to reside in one of the city’s most walkable neighborhoods while making new friends and experiencing all there is to do in this area,” said Jeff Berta, senior director of real estate development at Structured Development, the firm behind the three-building residential project that includes Post Chicago. “For many households, rent is their biggest monthly expense, so Post Chicago is another way we are promoting equitable housing in a location that might otherwise be unattainable.” Tripalink, which currently operates over 8,000 beds nationally, will manage and lease the property, with an on-site resident services coordinator who will help organize group activities. Cable and high-speed internet are included in monthly rents, and residents also benefit from weekly cleaning service, a community app and full suite of building amenities, including a fitness center, lounge areas for working and socializing, a rooftop deck with grilling stations, bike room with repair station and package room. There will be 43 paid parking spaces available for resident use. In addition to the co-living units, Post Chicago will offer 19 conventional unfurnished apartments in studio and two-bedroom layouts, with monthly rents starting at $1,799. Those residents will also have full access to building amenities and programming. Post Chicago is the second of three residential buildings totaling 487 units to be completed in a mixed-use, mixed-income development, Wendelin Park, bounded by Blackhawk, Dayton and Kingsbury streets on Chicago’s Near North Side. The others include The Seng, a recently opened, 34-unit all-affordable condo development and The Foundry, a 27-story, 327-unit market-rate rental tower scheduled to open in early 2024.

Topping out at 971 feet, the tower joins together with a second 49-story, 574-foot tower, occupying almost an entire city block.  Developed by JDL Development, the project includes 735 apartments, 77 condominiums, 55,000 square feet of office space, 188,000 square feet of retail space, and a LifeTime fitness and wellness center.  With Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture and Goettsch Partners teaming up on the architecture, the tower’s design consists of five vertical, rectilinear bars that step back at varying heights, creating multiple large terraces and making the tower more slender as it rises. Expressive fins vary in width to reinforce the verticality of the building, giving the facade a distinct texture. After beginning with the city’s tallest 16 towers, thank you to all of our readers for narrowing the pack and hand-picking Chicago’s best skyscraper for 2023! We hope everyone had a great time and enjoyed the process! ",Near North,0.0
Plan Commission approves 1535 N. Fremont,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved a mixed-use development at 1535 N. Fremont. Fronting N. Fremont St south of W. North Ave, the site is bound by the Toyota of Lincoln Park to the north and west and an alley to the south. With City Pads as the developer, the project will replace a vacant surface parking lot. Designed by NORR, the new mixed-use building will stand 5 floors high, delivering 132 residential units and approximately 8,000 square feet of retail space. The project’s unit mix will include 112 studios, 12 one-beds, and 8 two-beds. Residents will have access to 29 car parking spaces and 132 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. Cars will enter via a curb cut and garage entry along N. Fremont St at the southern end of the building.  Measuring 75 feet tall, the building will be designed with storefront glazing and brick at the ground floor to provide visibility along the street for the retail space. The residential entry is announced with an interruption in the brick base with a bay of the upper facade coming down to meet a framed opening for the entry. The mass of the upper floors has been broken down into smaller bays clad in three tones of fiber cement paneling and separated with dark gray ribbed metal panels. To allow for the project, the developer is seeking to rezone the site from C3-5 to a B3-5 designation with an overall Planned Development. The development’s ARO obligation is for 26.4 units, so the developer is providing 26 units on site at an average of 60% AMI and paying $60,000 in a fee in-lieu for the remaining 0.4 of a unit. With approval from the Chicago Plan Commission, the proposal will head to City Hall to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. A timeline for the $40 million project has not been announced. ",Near North,1.0
Construction has completed on The Seng,"Chicago-based Structured Development recently announced that it has completed construction and opened a new model unit at The Seng, its 34-unit affordable condominium building at 869 W. Blackhawk. As the first of three residential buildings totaling 487 units to be completed at Wendelin Park (formerly Big Deahl), the Seng will sit on a site bounded by W. Blackhawk St, N. Dayton St and N. Kingsbury St. Offering two-beds, three-beds, and four-bedroom units to income-restricted buyers, all homes at The Seng are reserved for individuals earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Buyers also must be preapproved for a traditional, FHA or VA loan and be certified through a homeownership program administered by the Chicago Housing Trust. Two-bedroom floor plans range from 824-868 square feet and are priced at $285,134. The new model unit showcases one of the development’s three-bedroom floor plans, which range from 988-1,186 square feet and are priced at $333,734, while four-bedroom residences range from 1,153-1,378 square feet and are priced at $374,696. “The Seng is an example of the city’s leadership in addressing a broad range of affordable and workforce housing needs, including a lack of quality, entry-level homes for those who would otherwise be priced out of many neighborhoods,” said Mike Drew, co-founding principal of Structured Development. “Faced with rising home prices and interest rates, many working individuals and families have given up on homeownership in Chicago. But inclusionary options like The Seng allow them to purchase a newly constructed condominium well below market rates while ensuring those homes remain affordable should buyers ever decide to move.”  CHT will begin accepting applications for the Seng on Feb. 27 and shared additional guidelines. Given high demand, CHT will accept applications for two-bedroom units between Feb. 27 and March 10 and conduct a lottery drawing on March 16. CHT has set an occupancy requirement of three or more persons for the three-bedroom units and will accept applications for these units on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning Feb. 27. CHT has set an occupancy requirement of four or more persons for the four-bedroom units and will accept applications on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning Feb. 27. Designed by GREC Architects, The Seng offers family-friendly floor plans with large windows that fill the homes with abundant natural light, 9-foot ceilings and modern finishes. Kitchens feature GE stainless steel appliances, Kohler chrome faucets, quartzite counters and two-tone cabinetry. Condos also include in-unit laundry, and each comes with a deeded garage parking space. Accessible residences are available. Residents will have access to a shared rooftop terrace, a fitness center, and bike storage. The Seng is named for Wendelin Seng, a German immigrant who founded a furniture manufacturing factory on the site in 1874. Among other items, the company mass-produced furniture hardware and introduced early sofa-sleepers and recliner chairs, according to company history. The building’s lobby design will feature wall art and original artifacts recovered from a 1902 time capsule found on the site during construction, all commemorating Seng and his company.  The other residences are Post Chicago (formerly Common Lincoln Park), a 10-story, 432-bed co-living community to be operated by New York-based Common; and the Foundry, a 27-story, 327-unit market-rate rental tower scheduled to be complete at the end of 2023. All three residential buildings are centered around the new 26,000-square-foot Wendelin Park, privately developed by Structured as a public amenity with a nature play area, dog run, community garden and gathering areas.

CTA announces reopening of Forest Park Blue Line tracks,"The Chicago Transit Authority has announced the completion of major track work as part of Phase 1 of the Forest Park Branch Rebuild. Blue Line trains are now running between the O’Hare and Forest Park stations, making all stops for the first since late-July. “Thanks to the coordination and tireless work from across the agency, this line-cut has finished on-time and on-budget— a timely benefit to the entire Blue Line,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “We knew that project work of this scale would be a disruption to our riders, which is why we kept an aggressive pace for the line-cut, working around the clock to resume normal service along our second busiest rail line.” As part of this $268 million project, crews have completely rebuilt almost three miles of track, between the LaSalle and Illinois Medical District (IMD) stations in 11 weeks. Additional work planned as part of Phase 1 project work continues, including the complete reconstruction of the Racine main station entrance and auxiliary entrance, as well as construction of the new Morgan substation. As the work was planned to minimize impact on customers, CTA sequenced the project to complete the trackwork with bus shuttle support and then complete the signal work while trains are running.  As such, trains will run temporarily at a reduced speed between LaSalle and IMD and then gradually increase up to the posted speed.  The full speed restoration is anticipated by the end of this year. Anticipated impacts to Blue Line service are expected in 2024-2025 as the remaining portions of Phase 1 project work is completed. Crews are continuing work to upgrade the traction power system that provides electricity to the system and will result in improved service reliability for the Blue Line. This work entails the construction of a new substation over the right-of-way at Morgan Street, as well as other upgrades being made to power system components in the area. The existing Racine station has already been demolished and crews have begun to rebuild the Racine main station entrance to make it fully accessible to those who use mobility devices. The station house at the main Racine entrance will include a new elevator. In addition to the elevator, a longer platform and new stairs will replace the ramp that once connected the platform to street level at Racine Avenue. The main entrance of the Racine station will remain closed and is expected to re-open in late-2024, at which time the Loomis St. auxiliary entrance will close for reconstruction through 2025. The Loomis St. auxiliary entrance of the Racine station reopened following the completion of track work.  ",Near West Side,0.0
Chicago City Council approves Fifth-Third Arena expansion,"The Chicago City Council has approved the expansion of Fifth-Third Arena at 301 S. Damen. Located at the southwest corner of W. Jackson Blvd and S. Wood St, the expansion will move west towards S. Damen Ave, occupying 4.25 acres out of 7.12 acres the team has acquired. Designed by Generator Studio, the expansion will consist of two regulation sized ice sheets with one such rink accommodating approximately 300 spectators and the other serving as a larger format rink with capacity of 1,500 spectators. The building will rise 44 feet against the existing arena and step up to 52 feet over the new westernmost ice rink.  The design complements the existing arena and breaks down the massing to improve the pedestrian experience and connect to the neighborhood. The main entry is pushed back from the street to create breathing room for pedestrians and help announce the entry. Glazing and lighting along the facade will contribute to improving the pedestrian experience and safety in the area. A smaller entryway on the south side of the building will cater to those coming from the Blue Line and the parking lot.  With Site Design Group on board, the landscaping will improve the pedestrian realm and lighten up W. Jackson Blvd. Exceeding the landscape ordinance, more than 60 trees will be added in addition to native plantings and an outdoor plaza. On the south side of the site, 215 parking spaces will be added to support the expansion.  With City Council approval secured, the site will be rezoned from B3-3 to C2-5 and the existing Planned Development is amended. Construction is expected to begin at the beginning of 2024 and wrap up in Q1 2026. As a result of community and alderman input, the proposal has foregone the potential residential or hotel development initially included in the zoning application. Any development on the western end of the site would require a fully separate review and approval process. ",Near West Side,0.0

Renderings emerge for Canal Station redevelopment,"Renderings have emerged for the redevelopment of Canal Station. Located at 801 S. Canal, the 850,000-square-foot building is being reimagined by New York-based 601W. Spanning almost an entire city block between W. Polk St and W. Taylor St, the six-story building used to be leased by Northern Trust.   With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board, the design will take advantage of the existing high bay large floor plates, concrete structure, loading docks, and utility infrastructure to deliver a highly amenitized workplace that can meet the needs of a broad range of tenants. Significant upgrades to the building façade allow for more natural light within the building, as well create a new identity for the building’s main entry. The lobby will be completely reimagined, incorporating a new monumental stair and a signature media screen. A new security desk is envisioned as a sculptural art form, serving as a central focal point within the generous volume of the lobby. Layered materials and textures of bleached maple, cold-rolled steel metal screens, and concrete floors offer a sophisticated urban ambiance and sense of welcome to the space. New retail spaces envisioned for cafes or bars open to the lobby, activating the space. A new tenant amenity package will measure 30,000 square feet, including a 7,300-square-foot outdoor terrace, a 5,000-square-foot fitness center, a tenant lounge and a conference center. Most floors will come with small, private outdoor terrace spaces for office tenants. 601W plans to offer tenants a shuttle bus along Canal Street to Union Station and Ogilvie Transportation Center, as well as 375 on-site parking spaces and new streetscapes next to the building. The $265 million is currently under construction and is targeted for completion by the end of the year. ",Near West Side,0.0

CTA announces rebuild of the Blue Line’s Forest Park branch,"As part of ongoing efforts to provide better, more reliable and accessible services to all Chicago transit users, the Chicago Transit Authority recently announced the start of work associated with Forest Park Branch Rebuild – a multi-year, multi-phased investment program to reconstruct the entire Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line and make it 100% accessible to those who use mobility devices. “The Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line is a critical transit asset for Chicago’s West Side communities, directly serving the Illinois Medical District, several schools and colleges, as well as numerous other growing employment centers,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The start of this project work is long overdue, and the CTA is committed to securing the additional funding to advance future phases of work to provide all Blue Line riders a better transit experience.” Work associated with Phase I of the Forest Park Branch Rebuild is scheduled to occur beginning Sunday, July 23 through Saturday, October 7. As part of this $268 million project, crews will completely rebuild 15,000 feet or almost three miles of track between the LaSalle and Illinois Medical District (IMD) stations; demolish and begin rebuilding the Racine station to meet modern accessibility guidelines; and upgrade the traction power system for improved service reliability. Opened in 1958, back when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the Forest Park Branch of the Blue Line has received some improvements, but after six decades of heavy use the tracks along the entire branch are beyond their useful life. This has resulted in nearly 80% of the branch being under slow zones, which cause service delays. Further, only four of the eleven stations (or 30%) along the branch are accessible to people who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices. To reduce travel impacts to customers, project work will be performed in two parts. Part A, lasting from July 23rd through late August will see the rebuilding of the track between the UIC-Halsted and LaSalle stations. During this time, Blue Line trains will operate in two segments: 1) between O’Hare and LaSalle, and 2) between Forest Park and IMD. The Clinton, UIC-Halsted and Racine stations will be temporarily closed. Part B, lasting from late August until October 7th will rebuild the track between the IMD and UIC-Halsted stations. During this time, Blue Line trains will operate in two segments: 1) between O’Hare and UIC-Halsted, and 2) between Forest Park and IMD. The Clinton, UIC-Halsted, and IMD stations will be open for rider use. Upon completion of track work in October, the Racine-Loomis St. auxiliary entrance only will re-open. The main entrance of the Racine station will remain closed and is expected to re-open in late-2024, at which time the Loomis St. Auxiliary entrance will close for reconstruction through 2025. Phase I project work is funded by a mix of state and local resources, including Rebuild Illinois, TIF and CTA Bonds. Additional funding is needed to advance future phases of the Forest Park Branch Rebuild, which in total is estimated to cost $3 billion, including Phase I work. More detailed information regarding alternative service options will be announced and made available on the project website (transitchicago.com/FPrebuild) in the coming weeks. ",Near West Side,0.0
Westhaven Park IID breaks ground,"Developers Brinshore Development and The Michaels Organization recently celebrated the groundbreaking of Westhaven Park IID, with Alderman Walter Burnett Jr and representatives from the Chicago Department of Housing in attendance among others.

City Church Chicago plans mixed-use expansion at 116 S. Paulina,"City Church Chicago has submitted a zoning application for their future home at 116 S. Paulina. Located at the northeast corner of S. Paulina St and W. Adams St, the site is currently vacant with CTA L tracks running along its western property line. Designed by Hutton and Hutton Architects and Engineers, the project is expected to be built out in multiple phases. Phase 1 will build a two-story building on the southern portion of the site, spanning 40,000 sf of space. The inside will hold City Church’s main worship space set to seat 1,500 people as well as retail space, a cafe, and administrative spaces. The second phase will expand the two-story volume to the north, filling in the site. This expansion will include multipurpose and conference rooms, youth programming and childcare areas, and shared admin and business office space.  The final and third phase will see the construction of a 12-story residential tower perched on top of the second phase on the northern portion of the property. Clad in glass and aluminum paneling, the 184-foot-tall tower will hold 76 residential units, with 15 of them set aside as affordable. With the project moving forward, City Church is seeking a rezoning from C1-3 to B3-5 before instituting an overall Planned Development designation. The proposal will undergo internal review by the Chicago Department of Planning and Development before seeking approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.

Blackhawks submit zoning application for Fifth Third Arena expansion,"The owners of the Chicago Blackhawks have submitted a zoning application for the expansion of Fifth Third Arena at 301 S. Damen. Located at the southwest corner of W. Jackson Blvd an S. Wood St, the expansion will move west towards S. Damen Ave occupying 4.25 acres out of 7.12 acres the team will be acquiring from Rush.  The Chicago Blackhawks and its ownership are committed to making Chicago proud by growing the game of hockey while simultaneously serving the surrounding community by increasing youth programming and creating an ecosystem of jobs and careers related to sports, entertainment and hospitality. This proposed expansion will blend seamlessly into the surrounding neighborhood, with a focus on enhancing the pedestrian experience and an emphasis of creating better multimodal connectivity on West Jackson Boulevard. Designed by Kansas City-based Generator Studio, the project team is providing a modem and cohesive design with the existing building and other nearby athletic facilities, including the United Center and the Advocate Center, the Chicago Bulls' recently constructed training facility. Expansion of Fifth Third Arena will consist of two regulation sized ice sheets with one such rink accommodating approximately 300 spectators and the other serving as a larger format rink with capacity of 1,500 spectators. The large format rink will provide increased opportunities to bid on more diverse entertainment events and attractions.  In addition to the two new rinks, the development will add a welcoming, light-filled central gathering space, 200 additional parking lot spaces, locker rooms, food and beverage space, and multi-use rooms. The expanded building structure will be designed to meet LEED Silver equivalent standards and will include a partial green roof, ample bicycle parking spaces, EV charging stations, and professionally designed eco-conscious exterior landscaping, in addition to the existing 26 bicycle parking spaces that will remain. With a large portion of the expansion being opaque, the potential for migratory bird collisions will be minimized. Parking areas will be well-landscaped and fenced, consistent with the City of Chicago's current standards.  While the Chicago Blackhawks will continue to utilize the existing facility for practice and rehabilitation, the team uses a very small percentage of the ice time. The additional ice rinks will provide new and expanded opportunities for programming and attraction of local and national events, tournaments, and entertainment. Upon completion, the four rinks will provide enhanced engagement of hockey and ice-skating programs to a wide range of users, with emphasis on local youth development. Programs will include ice skating, figure skating, recreational skating, recreational and advanced hockey leagues, tournaments, high school and college teams, semi-professional teams, off-ice training - including fitness and nutritional programs, and group events. The Chicago Blackhawks Foundation will continue to provide complimentary community programming including, but not limited to, hockey and off-ice development programs for local youth groups. The proposed expansion will also provide future generations of players, employees, neighbors and community members with a centrally located, city-centric home to learn, play and develop practical skills intended to serve them well beyond their time on the ice.  With future phases included in the zoning application, the further development could include as many as 1,200 residential units and 663 hotel keys, with retail space and parking included. Capped at a height of 295 feet, this future development has yet to be designed. This future work will need to be submitted to the city for site plan approval with a courtesy presentation to the Chicago Plan Commission before construction could begin. Looking forward, the Blackhawks will be finalizing the acquisition of the land from Rush, following the entering of the subject site by Rush into a lEPA Remedial Action Program, with projected acquisition taking place during Q3 or Q4 2023. Construction is set to commence in Q1 2024 and conclude during Q1 2026. The project is anticipated to be funded through a combination of traditional bank financing and private funding. The additional future development of retail, hotel, and residential buildings is anticipated to occur in future years beyond 2026.  ",Near West Side,0.0

Greater Union Baptist Church is officially a landmark,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation of Greater Union Baptist Church. Located at 1956 W. Warren, the church stands at the northeast corner of W. Warren Blvd and N. Damen Ave adjacent to the United Center’s vast parking lots. Originally built in 1886 as the Church of the Redeemer, the church was designed by prolific architect William Le Baron Jenney. In 1928, the church was bought by a black Baptist congregation and has been used as their place of worship for the last 94 years.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Greater Union Baptist Church traces its origin back to the universalist congregation who built the building. During the Civil War, the men and pastor served in the Union Army. After the war was over, the congregation had grown and raised funds to build the present church. They worshiped for 42 years and during that time provided extensive charitable aid to the community and hosted progressive-era lectures. For its association with two energetic pastors, the building also meets Criterion 3 for significant people. Reverend Shelbia Hamilton Graham preached from 1947 to 1967 and used the pulpit to support the spiritual needs of the congregation as well as the social needs of Chicago’s African American community at-large. Reverend Dr. Walter A McCray served from 1996 - 2002 and returned to the pulpit in 2018, serving to this day. Reverend McCray has increased community outreach and charitable programs at the church and is a nationally recognized, published biblical scholar. The next criterion the church meets is Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney, the brick church reflects Romanesque Revival with its distinct terracotta details and deep-set round arched windows. Jenney’s distinct articulation is visible on the church, with the single large gables on each facade reflecting his preference for fewer elements at a larger scale rather than smaller repeating forms. His trademark varnished southern pine-clad ceilings are also present in the soaring worship space of the church.  Pairing well with Criterion 4, the church also meets Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect or designer. As discussed earlier, William Le Baron Jenney is the architect of this church, however he’s best known for the invention of the skyscraper, designing the Home Insurance Building as the first skyscraper in the world. His design philosophy and the use of the metal frame for the skyscraper cleared the way for progressive architecture to flourish in the late 19th century.  Retaining a superb level of integrity, the church also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. Over its 136-year history, the church has endured economic disinvestment in its community and the dramatic change to the neighborhood due to the construction of the United Center and its associated parking lots. With credit due to its congregation, the church is a rare survivor of dire economic issues in the area.  With the landmark designation approved by the Chicago City Council, the church is now officially landmarked and is protected from demolition. As a part of the designation, the building’s exterior elevations and rooflines will be protected.  ",Near West Side,0.0
Chicago Fire breaks ground on training facility,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined Chicago FC Owner and Chairman Joe Mansueto, Alderman Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) CEO Tracey Scott, and Mary Baggett, President of the Local Advisory Committee for ABLA/Brooks Homes to celebrate the groundbreaking of the Fire’s new performance and training facility at 1336 S. Loomis in the Roosevelt Square neighborhood on the Near West Side.   ""The Chicago Fire is a top tier football club and the team and its players deserve a top tier training facility,"" said Mayor Lightfoot. ""I am also pleased that the Near West Side community will benefit from the job opportunities, recreational space, and housing support that CFFC has committed to providing as part of this development.""   As a complex for the team to prepare for matches and improve the team, it will include two and a half hybrid grass fields for the team and three synthetic turf fields for the Chicago Fire Academy. An inflatable dome will be placed on top of the northwest field during the colder months from November to March. With Crawford Architects on board for the design, the training facility will measure 53,000 square feet and stand two floors high, down from an original 95,000 square-foot, three-story plan. On the ground floor, program space will include locker rooms, medical space, workout space, hydrotherapy, and a video room. The second floor will host offices, a cafeteria, and meeting space for team operations. A 4,100 square foot building for the field crew will be located just off S. Loomis St and W. Hastings St. The campus will include a pedestrian greenway corridor through the site. Starting at the intersection of S. Loomis St and W. 14th Pl, the pathway will run through the site over to S. Ashland Ave and W. 14th St. Projected to cost $75-80 million, the project will be entirely privately funded by the team, with no city financing.

On the ground floor, program space will include locker rooms, medical space, workout space, hydrotherapy, and a video room. The second floor will host offices, a cafeteria, and meeting space for team operations. A 4,100 square foot building for the field crew will be located just off S. Loomis St and W. Hastings St. The campus will include a pedestrian greenway corridor through the site. Starting at the intersection of S. Loomis St and W. 14th Pl, the pathway will run through the site over to S. Ashland Ave and W. 14th St. Projected to cost $75-80 million, the project will be entirely privately funded by the team, with no city financing. The city recently announced the signing of a ground lease between the Chicago Fire FC and the Chicago Housing Authority that will generate $40 million in revenue for CHA over the next 40 years which will be applied towards the agency’s housing initiatives. This first permit issued for the project will allow for the construction of the one-story maintenance building for field crew and site work for the practice fields. Pepper Construction will be leading the construction of the facility which is targeted for a Summer 2024 opening. ",Near West Side,0.0
CTA awards contract for Racine Blue Line renovation,"The Chicago Transit Authority recently announced that the Racine Blue Line station is set to receive a major renovation after awarding a $75 million construction contract. As part of the CTA’s All Stations Accessibility Program, the work will make the station fully accessible with the addition of an elevator and other improvements.  Funded through Governor Pritzker’s Rebuild Illinois Capital Plan, the Chicago Transit Board approved the awarding of a contract not to exceed $75.4 million to FH Paschen following a competitive procurement process.  “This is another exciting step forward in our commitment to making the entire CTA rail system fully accessible,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The CTA has collaborated with Chicago’s disability community to pursue a vision of 100% accessibility for all customers.  Thanks to the funding we received through the Rebuild Illinois capital program, we’re now able to “unlock” one more station and soon provide a fully-accessible transit option for not only this West Side community, but for any of the millions who travel our rail system each year.”  Originally built in 1958, work at the Racine Blue Line Station will include fully reconstructing the main stationhouse located at 430 S. Racine with the inclusion of a new elevator, as well as significant upgrades to the auxiliary entrance and exit on S. Loomis St. a new ADA-accessible ramp from the station house to the platform will be constructed alongside new stairs and an extension of the platform itself.  To help improve the reliability of services and as part of larger plans to add additional trains to the Blue Line, the traction power system, which helps provide the power to run trains, will also get upgrades. That work will include a new power substation at Morgan Street, replacement of equipment at the existing Hermitage substation and other electrical work. Once completed, the Racine station will have clearly defined accessible pathways to and from train platforms, bus stops, and other major modal transfer points. All features along the pathway, such as fare arrays, shelters, benches, and passenger information, will be redesigned to remove barriers and allow for universal accessibility. Details regarding the timeline of project work, including start and completion dates, have not been announced yet. ",Near West Side,0.0
Final landmark approved for Greater Union Baptist Church,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for Greater Union Baptist Church. Located at 1956 W. Warren, the church stands at the northeast corner of W. Warren Blvd and N. Damen Ave adjacent to the United Center’s vast parking lots. Originally built in 1886 as the Church of the Redeemer, the church was designed by prolific architect William Le Baron Jenney. In 1928, the church was bought by a black baptist congregation and has been used as their place of worship for the last 94 years.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Greater Union Baptist Church traces its origin back to the universalist congregation who built the building. During the Civil War, the men and pastor served in the Union Army. After the war was over, the congregation had grown and raised funds to build the present church. They worshiped for 42 years and during that time provided extensive charitable aid to the community and hosted progressive-era lectures. For its association with two energetic pastors, the building also meets Criterion 3 for significant people. Reverend Shelbia Hamilton Graham preached from 1947 to 1967 and used the pulpit to support the spiritual needs of the congregation as well as the social needs of Chicago’s African-American community at-large. Reverend Dr. Walter A McCray served from 1996 - 2002 and returned to the pulpit in 2018, serving to this day. Reverend McCray has increased community outreach and charitable programs at the church and is a nationally recognized, published biblical scholar. The next criteria the church meets is Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney, the brick church reflects Romanesque Revival with its distinct terracotta details and deep-set round arched windows. Jenney’s distinct articulation is visible on the church, with the single large gables on each facade reflecting his preference for fewer elements at a larger scale rather than smaller repeating forms. His trademark varnished southern pine-clad ceilings are also present in the soaring worship space of the church.  Pairing well with Criterion 4, the church also meets Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect or designer. As discussed earlier, William Le Baron Jenney is the architect of this church, however he’s best known for the invention of the skyscraper, designing the Home Insurance Building as the first skyscraper in the world. His design philosophy and the use of the metal frame for the skyscraper cleared the way for progressive architecture to flourish in the late 19th century.  Retaining a superb level of integrity, the church also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. Over its 136-year history, the church has endured economic disinvestment in its community and the dramatic change to the neighborhood due to the construction of the United Center and its associated parking lots. With credit due to its congregation, the church is a rare survivor of dire economic issues in the area.  With the final landmark recommendation approved by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the proposed designation will protect all exterior elevations and rooflines. The landmark designation must go through the Committee on Zoning and full City Council before the building is officially landmarked.  ",Near West Side,0.0
Related Midwest breaks ground on Roosevelt Square Phase 3B,"Related Midwest recently broke ground on Roosevelt Square Phase 3B, the next installment of the mixed-income, master-planned development spanning 160 acres on the Near West Side. Formerly the site of the ABLA public housing project, Related Midwest is working with the Chicago Department of Housing and Chicago Housing Authority to ultimately deliver more than 2,000 new housing units at Roosevelt Square in Chicago’s Near West Side.  “Roosevelt Square is a great example of a group of committed, skilled partners coming together to create housing solutions that work for the community,” said Curt Bailey, President of Related Midwest. “With the Chicago Housing Authority as our partner, Related is thrilled to invest in this community with the highest quality residences at all income levels and to help this community grow in a way that benefits all residents.” Designed by Moody Nolan and Landon Bone Baker Architects, the building at 1002 S. Racine will hold 67 apartments, 10,000 square feet of retail space, and 33 parking spaces. The six-story building will have a unit mix of 17 CHA units at 20-60% AMI and 50 market-rate residences. The building will feature a fitness center, an indoor entertainment space, an amenity terrace, tenant storage, and indoor bike storage. Fresh Stop Produce & Deli and The Slice Shop, a local grocer and pizzeria, will be opening its largest location on the ground floor of the building.  Located at 1257 W. Roosevelt and 1357 W. Roosevelt, the next two structures have been designed as sister buildings. With a design from DesignBridge, both will rise six stories, holding 70 residential units and 40 parking spaces each. The 70 units in each project will break down into 29 CHA apartments at 20-60% AMI, 20 low-income units at 60-80% AMI, and 21 market-rate residences. The buildings will feature a fitness center, outdoor amenity space, a dog run, a package receiving room, tenant storage and indoor bike storage. Currently the last remaining building from the Jane Addams Homes, the final building at 925 S. Ada St will be restored and converted into 15 apartments and the National Public Housing Museum. 37 parking spaces will be provided as part of this site. With a design from Landon Bone Baker Architects and HED Architects, the apartment mix will consist of five CHA units, five affordable residences, and five market-rate units.  As part of this phase, Related Midwest and partners are reinvesting in 184 existing affordable apartments that were built during Phase 1. The rehabilitated homes will be upgraded with new flooring, modern cabinets, quartz counters, stainless steel appliances and new energy-efficient systems. Nia Architects is in charge of the architecture for the renovations. “As Mayor, one of my highest priorities is ensuring that all of our residents have access to affordable, safe and high-quality housing that empowers them on their journey toward upward mobility,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “By breaking ground on Phase 3B of the Roosevelt Square project, we will be that much closer to making this goal a reality for residents on the Near West Side. Once completed, this transformative project will not only add to our affordable housing stock, but also serve as a shining example of what is possible when we all work together to advance equity and inclusion.” Phase 3B of Roosevelt Square is designed to meet the criteria for the Chicago Sustainability Program, including exceeding the energy code by 25 percent and reducing indoor water use by 25 percent. The site design also includes native plantings and car charging stations for electric vehicles.  The general contractor on the project is a group of 100% minority-led firms, including BOWA Construction, Blackwood Group, and MIKK. Work on the apartments within the National Public Housing Museum building will be led by GMA Construction. Phase 3B is expected to be completed in Summer 2024.  ",Near West Side,0.0
1002 S. Racine scores full building permit,"A full building permit has been issued for 1002 S. Racine. Located at the southwestern corner of S. Racine Ave and W. Taylor St, the project is another installment of the Roosevelt Square Phase 3B development which has seen permits issued for the other three buildings planned at 1257 W. Roosevelt, 1357 W. Roosevelt and 925 S. Ada. Partnering with Chicago Housing Authority, the building is being developed by Related Midwest. Designed by Moody Nolan and Landon Bone Baker Architects, the new mixed-use building at 1002 S. Racine will rise six floors, holding approximately 10,000 square feet of retail space and 67 dwelling units. The apartments will be a mix of 17 CHA units for those making between 20 and 60% AMI and 50 market-rate units. Residents will have access to 33 parking spaces in a surface lot behind the building.  The massing of the building consists of multiple parts, including a three-story brick base that wraps the corner and ties into the neighborhood context, topped by a midrise portion that sets back from the street at an angle. Already signed by a local grocer, the retail space will face W. Taylor St. Tenants will enter the building through the residential entry along S. Racine Ave with their parking spots at the back of the site accessible via the alley.   With the reported $20 million building fully permitted, general contractor Bowa Construction can begin work on site. A timeline for completion has not been announced.  ",Near West Side,1.0

Apartments headed to narrow Wicker Park lot,"At the border of Wicker Park and Noble Square, plans are advancing to bring a 14-unit transit-oriented apartment development to a narrow overgrown lot that has sat vacant for 20 years. The upcoming four-story building—called Wicker Park Place—is slated for the corner of Milwaukee and Haddon Avenue. Developed by Mark Sutherland of Wicker Park Apartments and designed by Milbury Architects, the project will contain a small ground-floor retail space, 8 one-bedroom rental units, and 6 studio apartments.  Since the corner site at 1162 N. Milwaukee Avenue is located less than 500 feet from the Division and Ashland Blue Line stop, Wicker Park Place qualifies as a transit-oriented development (TOD). The designation allows the skinny lot to be developed into multiple housing units without off-street parking.  The location is also within the Milwaukee Corridor ARO pilot zone which requires the developer to offer two apartments (15 percent of the total units) at below-market rates. The development will also provide streetscape improvements including new parkway trees and a public bike rack. The Zoning Board of Appeals recently voted to approve a pair of variances (reductions in the rear setback and minimum lot area) for Wicker Park Place. According to the project's website, groundbreaking is scheduled for this summer, and delivery is expected in summer 2022.       ",Noble Square,0.0
City Council approves music venue at 1675 N. Elston,"The Chicago City Council has approved plans for a new music and entertainment venue at 1675 N. Elston. Located in the North Branch Industrial Corridor, the property was previously a nightclub that got shut down. The existing two-story masonry building on the site will get rehabbed by developer 1675 Holdings LLC who bought the property in 2018 with the intention of re-envisioning the site as a new venue space. Dubbed The Outset, the new entertainment venue will retain the existing two-story masonry building while enlivening the facade with a new mural. On the street-facing elevation, two new windows and an egress door will puncture the currently solid wall and add some transparency along the street. Visitors will enter the property through the adjacent open space before entering the building from the south. Outside, a large outdoor patio will feature extensive landscaping, a center water feature, a food truck parked along the back of the property, and bathroom facilities for patrons. This outdoor space will be screened from the street with a black steel fence with landscaping in front of it. With a relatively small site for the industrial corridor, no car parking is required, and the plan will not provide any. The developer expects most visitors to arrive via rideshare, public transit, biking, or walking. There will be 17 on-site bike parking spaces and the Elston bike lane will be raised up to the sidewalk level and placed inside of the parking lane to avoid door slams from cars stopping to drop people off. The development will also include the addition of 5 more bikes to the existing Divvy station on W. Wabansia Ave.  With City Council approval, the site will now be rezoned from M3-3 to C2-1 with an overall Planned Development designation.

Landmarks approve tax incentive for Morton Salt shed redevelopment,"Chicago's iconic Morton Salt shed is one step closer to becoming a mixed-use destination for dining and entertainment after the Commission on Chicago Landmarks unanimously approved a tax break to aid in the property's restoration. Known as a Class L Property Tax Incentive, the measure reduces tax assessments for landmarked buildings over a 12-year period with the caveat that the owner must invest at least half of the value of the property into its rehabilitation. The Morton site was eligible for the incentive after the Chicago City Council voted to make the 4.2-acre riverfront property at 1357 N. Elston Avenue an official Chicago Landmark at last Friday's City Council meeting. Co-developers Blue Star Properties and R2 are currently repositioning the former industrial building into a mixed-use complex comprising new office space, food and beverage offerings, a public riverwalk, and a waterfront performance venue. Chicago architecture firm Lamar Johnson Collaborative is steering the effort to reimagine the existing structure, which was designed by architects Graham, Anderson, Probst & White and completed in 1930. The entire project will cost an estimated $45.7 million, and the developers will receive a $7 million tax abatement during the 12 years of the Class L incentive. After that time, the rehabilitated property is expected to generate an estimated $1.6 million in tax revenue each year, according to data from Landmarks staff. The Class L designation still needs to pass the Chicago City Council for final approval.  The historic truss-roofed warehouse, which is instantly recognized for its oversized “umbrella girl” rooftop logo, ceased official operations in 2015. Morton Salt, however, will once again have a presence at the North Branch site when it opens a new research and development facility at the location.

Developers plan 34-unit North Branch apartment project,"More developers are betting on increased demand for rental housing in Chicago's North Branch Corridor, as the area evolves from an industrial no man's land to a mixed-use neighborhood. At 1838 N. Elston Avenue, a joint venture comprising JAB Real Estate and L2 Properties wants to replace a single-story commercial building with a six-story apartment complex.  Designed by Fitzgerald Associates Architects, the 77-foot-tall building would feature 3,330 square feet of ground-floor retail topped by 34 efficiency, one-, and two-bedroom apartments. The proposal takes advantage of nearby bus routes and the Clybourn Metra station and includes no on-site vehicular parking. It will offer an off-street loading berth, a bike room, and a rooftop amenity level with a resident lounge, fitness room, outdoor terrace, and a dog run. The project site is located just west of the multiphase Lincoln Yards megaproject which will eventually bring 14 million square feet of mixed-use development to the North Branch Corridor. A few blocks to the north, the upcoming Triangle Square project will soon deliver 72 condos and just shy of 400 apartments to the changing area. The developers behind 1838 N. Elston will need the city to approve a Residential Business Planned Development application as well as an Industrial Corridor Map Amendment before construction can begin. The project is listed on the agenda of the upcoming June 17 meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission. If approved, the matter will then head to the zoning committee and full City Council for a final vote.   ",North Branch,0.0
Boutique offices takes shape along evolving North Branch Corridor,"Drivers on the Kennedy Expressway may have noticed an unusual Jenga-like building under construction at 1525 N. Elston Avenue.  Developed by Alex Pearsall of Property Adventures Corp. and designed by Filoramo Talsma Architecture, the six-story structure might look like modular apartments, but it is in fact the latest office project to spring up in the rapidly evolving North Branch Corridor.  “I’ve heard people ask ‘what is that building?,’” said Ari Topper, a broker for 1525 N. Elston with Baum Realty Group. “It doesn’t look like the typical office product you’d find in the area.”  Boutique in the truest sense of the word, the office floorplans will range from just 3,000 and 4,000 square feet in size. In addition to eye-catching architecture, the building will also offer views of downtown Chicago and parking for 21 vehicles. Two of the building’s five office floors are already leased up, according to Topper. The development is on track to deliver space to tenants in the late second or early third quarter of this year. The progress at 1525 N. Elston—despite the pandemic—is an encouraging signal in the ongoing transformation of the once-industrial North Branch Corridor, which borders neighborhoods such as Bucktown, Lincoln Park, and Noble Square. A sweeping 2017 rezoning of the area has catalyzed investment in the area. Developments include nearby adaptive reuse projects like the loft offices at 1308 N.

Community reacts to development at 3950 N. Damen and 3959 N. Lincoln,"Developers of 3950 N. Damen and 3959 N. Lincoln recently presented their revised plans to the community. Located at the intersection of N. Damen Ave, N. Lincoln Ave, and W. Irving Park Rd, the plan includes the surface parking lot and bank building at 3950 N. Damen as well as the five-story Fifth Third bank building at 3959 N. Lincoln.  Planned by Orchard Development Group and Ravine Park Partners, the new development at 3950 N. Damen is now set at seven stories tall. Topping out at 88 feet, the building’s massing starts at seven stories along W. Irving Park Rd, then drops down to six floors before finishing at four stories at the south end. The S-shape design breaks down the mass of the building while providing outdoor resident spaces including a public plaza at the residential entry. On the ground floor, the building will have 2,500 square feet of corner retail space for Fifth-Third Bank, with an additional 1,700 square feet of space for another retailer. The residential lobby will face a public plaza along N. Damen Ave with the remaining frontage to south being occupied by the fitness center and bike room. A curb cut at the southernmost end of the site will give access to the building’s 110 parking spots, 85 of which are for residents, 10 of which are for Fifth-Third Bank, and the remaining ten are currently flex spaces either for additional retail parking, carsharing, or EV charging stations. The upper floors will be home to 170 residential units, split into 52 convertibles or studios, 81 one-beds, and 37 two-beds. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the northern facade at the intersection has been designed with a series of alternating balconies, giving a dynamic expression to the prominent corner. As the massing steps down, the color of brick and metal panel changes to further break up the massing by taking on a multi-building expression.  --- At 3959 N. Lincoln, affordable developer Brinshore Development has come on board and will lead the rehabilitation of the historic bank building. Partnering with Apna Ghar, the entire bank building will become 64 permanent supportive housing units for survivors of gender-based violence. The project will not be a shelter for people actively fleeing violence but will serve survivors who are coming from transitional housing as a step on their way back into market-rate housing as they get back on their feet. Supportive services in the building will include education planning, financial empowerment, children's programming, counseling, and job skills development. With LBBA on board as the architect, the bank building will get a five-story addition connected to its wings on the south and east that will connect around to enclose a center courtyard. Matching the height of the existing structure, the new facades will be clad in brick veneer with composite and metal panel accents next to the windows. While showing respect and deference to the bank building, the addition will reinforce the street walls and improve the pedestrian experience. On the ground floor, 3,130 square feet of retail space will occupy the corner frontage and stretch down N. Lincoln Ave. The residential lobby and management offices will occupy the N. Lincoln Ave frontage within the new addition, with 18 parking spaces behind them. The original banking hall space will be used for resident amenities and support services space. On the second floor, the double-height space of the banking hall will be retained and used for further support services space. The remainder of this floor and all of the upper floors will hold the 64 apartments, broken down into a mix of 14 one-beds, 36 two-beds, and 14 three-beds. A resident amenity deck on the roof will overlook N. Lincoln Ave. The proposed financing of this affordable rehab would be LIHTC equity, soft funding from IHDA and a commercial loan. Brinshore Development will be submitting an application to IHDA in the spring, which will include a request for soft funding as well. At the community meeting, residents questioned how the bank building went from a market rate scheme to an affordable development. Alderman Martin explained that during discussions they asked the developer to go beyond the minimum 20% affordability required by the ARO, which they were amenable to. One of the options was this version to provide housing for a domestic violence organization, which led to conversations with Apna Ghar and ultimately Brinshore Development came into the conversation and took over the building as an all-affordable project.  A neighbor raised concern over the parking counts for the development considering an estimate of two cars per unit. The development team responded that the idea that each unit would have two cars is largely unfounded and that data shows that approximately a quarter of renters have no cars and residents near transit options have less cars. While this isn’t a zero-parking facility, they said their 0.5 ratio is supported by a market study and parking utilization study. Another resident asked why the development was still seven stories tall and thought it was too big and should be a maximum of five stories. Alderman Martin jumped in here to respond that through the continued conversations and feedback there is a split in opinion with some residents preferring upwards of eight stories and others wanting fewer. The architects followed up that the massing and stepping down of the building has been a great urban design solution and is a strategy to respond to height concerns. They also noted that the bank building used to be higher than everything around it when it was built too. When residents expressed concerns around this development setting a precedent for taller buildings in the neighborhood, Alderman Martin chimed in to reassure them that this would not be setting a uniform rule across all the arterials with development interest, and that his office will take each proposal as they come and solicit lots of good feedback. When some neighbors brought up traffic concerns, the development team responded that their traffic study reports that the project will have little, or no impact and the design will actually remove three curb cuts on the site that is currently a drive through and parking lot. Moving the single curb cut down the southernmost end of the site will help minimize its impact on congestion at the intersection.  The meeting wrapped up with a public comment portion that saw a slew of neighbors responding very positively to the development, with just a few giving negative feedback. While saying he is getting closer to making a decision, Alderman Martin said that there isn’t any specific timing on when he will make his final decision about whether to support the development or not and will be continuing to solicit feedback. As a proposed amendment to the Planned Development, the project will need to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council.  ",North Center,1.0

Revised details for 3950 N. Damen presented to community,"Developers of 3950 N. Damen and 3959 N. Lincoln recently presented their revised plans to the community.  Located at the intersection of N. Damen Ave, N Lincoln Ave, and W. Irving Park Rd, the plan includes the surface parking lot and bank building at 3950 N. Damen as well as the five-story Fifth Third bank building at 3959 N. Lincoln. Orchard Development Group and Ravine Park Partners are partnering on the project. With a history dating back to December 2020, the Damen site was originally proposed as a new grocery store with a new multifamily building on the Lincoln site. After being rejected, the developers came back to the community with an eight-story building on the Damen site and the rehab of the bank building with an addition. After the community rejected the height, they cut the Damen site down to 7 floors and presented that plan to the Committee on Design. With a configuration that was 7 floors by the intersection and five further south, the Committee on Design suggested they return to a denser building along W. Irving Park Rd. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the project team presented two schemes. The first kept the 7-story volume along W. Irving Park Rd with five floors further south, setting back the top floor to reduce its impact on the street. The second version looked at making the northern portion 8 floors and lowering the southern portion to just four floors.  Rising 82 feet, the 7-and-5-story scheme would deliver 176 residential units, split into 70 junior one-beds and studios, 33 one-beds, and 73 two-beds and three-beds. Fifth Third Bank will occupy 3,500 square feet of the retail space and have an internal drive through accessed via a curb cut on N. Damen Ave. The ground floor will be rounded out with another 1,700 square feet of retail, a fitness center, bike storage, and 73 parking spaces.   Rising 92 feet, the 8-and-4-story scheme would deliver 166 residential units, split into 65 junior one-beds and studios, 33 one-beds, and 68 two-beds and three-beds. Fifth Third Bank will occupy 3,500 square feet of the retail space and have an internal drive through accessed via a curb cut on N. Damen Ave. Similar to the 7-story plan, the ground floor will be rounded out with another 1,700 square feet of retail, a fitness center, bike storage, and 73 parking spaces.  Both of these plans would rehab the bank building with two five-story additions on the wings of that building. Rising 65 feet, the new additions onto 3959 N. Lincoln will result in a total of 92 units, split into 46 one beds and 46 two-beds and three-beds. The ground floor will have 5,000 square feet of retail with 22 parking spots. The development will incorporate 20% units at 60% AMI, while also working with the alderman’s office to pursue city subsidies to increase that percentage. Since Fifth Third Bank owns the site, the developers are required to include the bank in the new building with the drive through, vacating the retail space of the historic bank building and opening it up to new tenants.  The developers expect the approval process to last another six months before spending 18-24 months building the new midrise at 3950 N. Damen. One that is done, Fifth Third Bank will move from their space in 3959 N. Lincoln into the new retail space, allowing the developers to begin work on the historic bank building as a second phase to the project. This second phase will last another year, leading to the overall project taking three to four years. ",North Center,1.0

1800 W. Berenice lands foundation permit,"A foundation permit has been issued for 1800 W. Berenice. Led by Landrosh Development, the project site is located at the intersection of N. Ravenswood and W. Berenice Avenue. A rezoning of the property from B2-1.5 to B2-3 was approved back in March 2021.  Designed by local firm SGW Architecture and Design, the project will rise 80 feet over the course of six floors. The building’s scope will encompass approximately 3,000 square feet of ground food retail, roughly 10,000 square feet of private office suites on the second floor of the building, and 44 residential units above. On the ground floor, retail space will face N. Ravenswood Avenue, while parking for 25 cars will be provided behind the retail at grade. A parking lot behind the project is not part of the development. 40 bike parking spaces will be included in the project for tenants’ use.  Spread between the third through sixth floors, the residential unit mix will include four studios, 36 one-bedrooms, and four two-bedroom residences. Eight of the apartments will be designated as affordable. The building will be topped by a green roof and the west wall of the parking garage will feature a mural. A demolition permit was issued back in December 2021 and a zoning variance was approved this past February. With the foundation permit in hand, general contractor Macon Construction can commence work on the new building. A completion date for the project has not been announced. ",North Center,1.0
Committee on Design reviews 3950 N. Damen,"The Committee on Design has reviewed a proposed mixed-use development at 3950 N. Damen. Located at the intersection of N. Damen Ave, N Lincoln Ave, and W. Irving Park Rd, the plan includes the surface parking lot and bank building at 3950 N. Damen as well as the five-story Fifth Third bank building at 3959 N. Lincoln. CRG and Ravine Park Partners are partnering on the project. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the project looks to create a gateway to North Center with density that is responsive to the neighborhood and also offers public space. At 3959 N. Lincoln, the scheme will retain the existing bank building, converting the upper floors to residential and building additions to each leg of the building. The new proposal at 3950 N. Damen is conceived as a mixed-use building that will offer ground floor commercial space for Fifth Third bank alongside additional retail space. 176 residential units will rise above the ground floor podium in an S-shape volume that snakes north to south. The volume will be the tallest along W. Irving Park Rd at seven stories and then steps back to five floors along N. Damen Ave. The massing is angled away from the corner to guide pedestrians into the public plaza along N. Damen Ave and preserve views of the existing bank building at 3959 N. Lincoln.  The design team decided on this design after conceptualizing many different volumetric forms. While the team was originally targeting a 5.0 FAR, the current plan meets a 4.0 FAR. Other versions looked at spreading the mass out evenly on the site with staggered setbacks along the facade or increasing the height of the tower portion along W. Irving Park to achieve the 5.0 FAR.  As part of the development, Fifth Third Bank, who owns the land, is requesting a drive-through for the bank location. Despite the fact that the surrounding streets have a P-Street designation (which usually prohibits drive-throughs), the current plan shows a curb cut along N. Damen Ave to accommodate the ground floor parking and drive-through. The design team studied relegating traffic to the alley and, due to many one-way streets, residents would have to snake through neighborhood streets which could cause more issues than having a single access point along N. Damen Ave. The discussion portion mainly centered around the bulk and massing on the new building. Reed Kroloff began the conversation by saying that the project seems like a lot of bulk for this site and that they should try to rethink the idea of the double-loaded corridor to see how they could slim up the building. Kroloff mentioned how the bending of the new building to preserve the views is a nice gesture, but the base level could do a lot more to respect the corner. John Ronan suggested that the design could potentially be a courtyard style where units could face into an interior courtyard with family units having access to the green space for a safe area for kids to play. Ronan also discussed the idea of bringing townhomes down to the ground floor along N. Damen Ave to better transition into the more residential urban fabric and activate the street. The final suggestion from Ronan was to consider a taller tower volume in the center of the site and wrap it with a lower building so that the perceived mass is reduced at the direct adjacencies, but the desired scope of the project can still be achieved.  Reed Kroloff chimed in to build on Ronan’s idea, saying that a taller 8-10 story building in the middle wrapped by a lower building may be more comfortable for the neighborhood. Kroloff also suggested shifted the units or rotating them to create a staggered facade that can give the appearance of reducing bulk without actually making the building smaller Brian Lee was sympathetic to the issues the development team is dealing with, trying to achieve a certain FAR while appeasing the neighborhood and the alderman. Lee said the current massing parti is not a bad idea, but the design doesn’t make an effort to improve the quality of housing in Chicago. The one main elevator core with long hallways is not ideal for residents. Lee also commented that he understands the issue of height is difficult for this site but suggested there could be more finely tuned details to modulate the massing in a way that it reads less bulky.  A representative from the development team thanked the committee members for their comments and explained how the design is a product of trying to address competing factors. As the developers, they would not have an issue going for a taller building, but they were met with strong resistance by neighbors for anything over seven floors. They are trying to create a sense of place and offer an amentizied building for residents, so a larger scale building is necessary. The final comment came from Hana Ishikawa who encouraged the design team to look closer at how to make the sidewalks more pedestrian friendly, asking them to study widening the sidewalk and consider cutting back the building at the corner to provide a spacious corner at the intersection.  As a proposed amendment to the Planned Development, the project will continue through the city review process and will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council. Construction is supposed to begin at 3950 N. Damen in 2023 and wrap up in 2024, while the building at 3959 N. Lincoln will begin work in 2024 and complete in 2025.   ",North Center,0.0
Developers propose residential project at 3950 N. Damen,"Plans have been revealed for a mixed-use development at 3950 N. Damen. Announced via Alderman Matt Martin’s weekly newsletter to constituents, the proposal comes from a partnership between CRG and Ravine Park Partners. Proposing to amend the existing Planned Development, the project site includes the existing bank building at 3959 N. Lincoln Ave and the surface parking lot and drive-through at 3950 N. Damen Ave. With a design from Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the project includes the rehabilitation of the existing bank building with new additions included, and a ground-up new construction structure at the site of the current surface parking lot. In total, the project will deliver 301 residential units and approximately 10,000 square feet of retail space to the intersection of N. Damen Ave, W. Irving Park Road, and N. Lincoln Ave.  At 3959 N. Lincoln, the existing bank building will be converted into a mixed-use building with additions matching the building’s height along both W. Irving Park Rd. and N.

At 3950 N. Damen, the new mixed-use structure will rise 7 floors, tallying 81 feet tall along W. Irving Park Rd, stepping down along N. Damen Ave to a lower height of 61 feet and 5 floors at the south end of the property. A 3,000 square foot publicly accessible plaza will be included on the ground floor with 5,500 square feet of retail space fronting the intersection, including 4,000 square feet for the existing Fifth-Third Bank branch.  On the upper floors, the building will host 186 residential units, including a mix of 72 studios, 32 one-beds, and 82 two- and three-beds. 74 parking spaces will be included on the ground floor towards the southern end of the building. 87 bicycle parking spaces will be provided in the new building. Residential units would rent at $1,350/month for studios, $2,000/month for one-beds, $2,600/month for two-beds, and $3,500/month for three-beds. 61 of the rental units will be designated as affordable.  As a proposed amendment to the Planned Development, the project will undergo an extensive community and city review.

Infill condo project ready to rise on Irving Park Road ,"More residential development is on its way to Irving Park Road in North Center. This week, developer 2024 W Irving Park LLC scored an estimated $2.6 million construction permit to build a four-story mixed-use building on a vacant site that previously served as parking for the former Lincoln Restuarant. The upcoming masonry building from Hanna Architects calls for ground-floor retail space fronting Irving Park and garage parking for 12 vehicles, accessed via the existing rear alleyway. The upper floors would house 12 for-sale residences that would be at least 1,400 square feet in size. Unit prices are expected to start at around $625,000. Due to a recent type 1 rezoning of the property at 2024 W. Irving Park Road, the new development must include one affordable-rate unit on-site, per the city's rules.  In December, the Zoning Board of Appeals approved a request for a variance to reduce the planned building's rear setback. Panoptic Group is listed as the general contractor, according to the permit. The 2024 W. Irving Park Road condos aren't the only new developments headed this North Center block. Other proposals include 44 apartments slated for 2035 W.

Developer pitches 22-apartment TOD in North Center,"In North Center, developer Campbell Street Asset Management is seeking a zoning change to construct a four-story, 22-unit transit-oriented development (TOD) at 2046 W. Irving Park Road. If approved, the project would replace a vacant residence along the busy commercial corridor.  Designed by SPACE Architects + Planners, the proposed building features a mostly masonry facade with a limestone base and balconies fronting Irving Park Road. Because the project qualifies as a TOD, it includes reduced on-site parking for just 13 cars (seven within a ground-floor garage and six out back), EV charging stations, and storage for 24 bicycles. According to a recent email from the office of Ald. Matt Martin (47th), the proposed unit mix calls for three studios renting for $1,440, 15 one-bedroom apartments starting at $1,900, three two-bedrooms for $2,800, and a single 3-bedroom unit going for $3,425. Four of the apartments will be set aside as affordable housing, which is twice the 10 percent currently required by the current city ordinance.  The 47th Ward’s Zoning Advisory Council is scheduled to review the project at its July meeting and Martin will take the group's recommendation under consideration when making his own decision to support—or deny—the developer's requested zoning change from B1-1 to B2-3.  The proposal for 2046 W. Irving Park isn't the only North Center development in the works from Campbell Street and SPACE. Just across the street, the companies have teamed up to replace the strip mall and parking lot at 2035 W. Irving Park with a five-story mixed-use building containing 44 rental units.

Urbanize tours OC Living at 1325 S. Washtenaw,"Urbanize recently toured OC Living, the first residential building at Ogden Commons in North Lawndale. Located at 1325 S. Washtenaw, the project is developed by The Habitat Company, along with Sinai Health System. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the new construction is a four-story all-residential building with 92 units.  Touring with McHugh Construction and The Habitat Company, we began by heading up to the roof. While not accessible to residents, extensive views of the surrounding neighborhood and towards downtown could be seen from the roof. Heading back into the building, our next stop was the fourth floor. As the top residential floor, crews had already installed framing for the residential units. Mechanicals, plumbing, and electrical work were underway on this floor. Our next stop was the second floor, where crews have begun installing drywall. With units coming together, cabinets and finishes will be installed soon. 90% of the apartments will be affordable with the remainder rented at market-rate. The rental unit mix includes 23 studios, 60 one-bedrooms and nine two-bedroom apartments.  Our final stop was the ground floor, where crews have yet to start drywall. The ground floor is home to a wing of apartments, the residential lobby at the northwest corner of the building, and another wing of amenity spaces. Residents will have access to a fitness center, community meeting rooms, a bike room, and package and mail rooms. Management offices will also be included.  Once completed, the building will feature outdoor amenities including an enclosed rubber-surfaced children’s tot lot with play structures, bike racks, a lighted on-site walking path, landscaped lawn and 110 parking stalls. With construction in full swing, McHugh Construction and Bowa Construction will have the building ready for leasing starting in April 2024. ",North Lawndale,0.0

4300 W. Roosevelt breaks ground,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot, along with partners from 548 Development and Related Midwest, broke ground recently on 4300 W. Roosevelt, one of the Invest South/West RFP winners. Spanning 21 acres, the North Lawndale site is bounded by Roosevelt Rd, and Kostner, Kildare and Fifth Avenues. Prior to being purchased by the city, the industrial corridor was occupied by a Copenhagen snuff plant and other industrial users before being cleared in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1990s, the site was a source of controversy when several aldermen took bribes to allow illegal dumping of hazardous materials on the land, which created dangerous conditions for nearby residents and led to an FBI probe known as Operation Silver Shovel.  ""I'm thrilled to see this project get underway and deliver job opportunities and community gathering spaces to North Lawndale residents,"" said Mayor Lightfoot. ""Through INVEST South/West, we are creating visible enhancements while providing good paying jobs to communities that have been denied resources for far too long, and this project is no different. Not only will this project revitalize the surrounding community, but it will also strengthen our city’s industrial and innovation sectors.""   The $68 million project will deliver two 181,760 square foot, solar-powered industrial warehouses with more than 50 dock spaces designed by Ware Malcomb. Two 5,000 square foot innovation centers and a public park for community use will occupy the south end of the site, designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative. The innovation centers will maximize opportunities for neighborhood groups to host community meetings and events as well as workforce development programs.  The neighborhood park will adjoin the innovation center buildings and is designed to support activities such as markets, food trucks and pop-up stands. The landscaping plan by Site Design Group aims to reintroduce native biodiversity through replanting historic ground species. The 3-acre green space will offer three distinct public spaces, a circuitous fitness path, and over 300 shade trees throughout the site. In addition, the project will include a three-megawatt rooftop community solar system that will be supported by a West Side training program and power approximately 500 West Side homes. The project is expected to bring 250 temporary jobs and 250 permanent jobs to North Lawndale. City support for the project includes $8 million in Tax Increment Financing assistance and the sale of 21 acres of City-owned land for $1 per lot. General contractors Pepper Construction and GMA Construction Group will build the development, with completion expected for Fall 2024. ",North Lawndale,0.0

New developments set to revitalize Ogden Ave corridor,"Developers presented their plans for three developments in the Ogden Avenue corridor in North Lawndale to the local community. Sited within the Department of Planning and Development’s Invest South/West Ogden Avenue corridor, the projects are planned for three separate sites.   -- Lawndale Redefined  Lawndale Redefined is a $31.4 million project by GRE Ventures, Imagine Group, and 548 Development. Planned for an acre of vacant, city-owned and private land at 3400 W. Ogden Ave, the project consists of a five-story mixed-income residential building, an arts and technology center that will be operated by City Colleges of Chicago, and retail space.  Designed by Wight & Company, the venture will produce 60 apartments as well as three for-sale townhomes that will be intended to be prototypes for future infill development. The retail and commercial spaces are expected to host a dine-in restaurant at the corner of W. Ogden Ave and S. Homan Ave, a rooftop bistro, and a small-scale grocer at W. Ogden Ave and S. Trumbull Ave.  An outdoor courtyard will offer space for the community with a splash pad, history trail, and other features for public use. The developers are working to secure financing through IDHA and finalize the funding package by the end of the year. They are aiming to begin construction in Q1 2023. -- Ogden Hotel Originally a submission to the North Lawndale Invest South/West RFP, the Ogden Hotel project is being led by Proxima Management. After they were not selected for the RFP site, the development team worked with DPD to select a new site in the area to build the planned hotel.  The original plan called for an eight-story building with approximately 200 hotel rooms, with ground floor retail and restaurant space. The project would incorporate 220 parking spots and feature a rooftop bar. Now sited at 3536 W. Ogden Ave, the project will be very similar to the RFP proposal. Estimated to cost about $48.8 million, the revised project will adjust to the new site which will end up in a massing that would be potentially mirrored. The property is currently made up of four parcels, with two owned by the city, one owned by Lawndale Christian, and one owned privately. The team is working to acquire the parcels as they move forward with the project. -- Grace Manor Developed by East Lake Management and Grace at Jerusalem CDC, Grace Manor is an affordable housing development at 3401 W. Ogden Ave. Sited along W. Ogden Ave, the property is currently a parking lot for the local 10th District police station.  Planned to hold 65 affordable housing units and ground floor retail space, the six-story building will deliver 46 apartments marketed at 60% AMI, including 22 one-beds and 24 two-bed configurations. The remaining 19 rentals will be fulfilled under the CHA RAD program, offering 9 one-beds and 10 two-bedroom units. Tenant amenities will include a fitness center, laundry, rooftop terrace, package room, computer room, and on-site management. 18 car parking spaces and a bike room will also be provided. Approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in January 2022, the development team expects to wrap up final city approvals this spring and secure financing over the summer. Construction is expected to begin this fall. At the meeting, led by local alderman Michael Scott Jr. (24th ward) and DPD, the alderman indicated that there are more projects coming down the pipeline for North Lawndale and the Invest South/West corridor. While still in the very early stages, Lawndale Christian Development Corporation is planning an all-affordable development, while the North Lawndale Community Coordinating Council is reportedly in the efforts of getting a grocery store to open along the W.

City of Chicago announces winner of Roosevelt/Kostner RFP site,"The City of Chicago has announced the winner of the Invest South/West RFP for the Roosevelt/Kostner site. Chosen out of a set of eight responses, the project site spans 21 acres addressed at 4300 W. Roosevelt Rd in North Lawndale. Developed by 548 Development and Related Midwest, the $38.4 million project will develop a solar-powered 302,000-square-foot industrial complex. Paired with a pair of community centers, the proposal will round out with public open space. The complex’s design comes from a team including Lamar Johnson Collaborative, Ware Malcomb, and Site Design Group. Dubbed Lawndale Innovation Center, the new facility will leverage the location’s strengths for freight and logistics with a pair of industrial structures. The two will include one building spanning 153,460 square feet with 31 dock spaces on the northern portion of the site, and a second building measuring 148,680 square feet with another 31 deck spaces on the southern side of the site. Parking areas for 86 trailers and 417 cars will be included. Planned for the southern edge of the site, the development will include the North Lawndale Innovation Center, providing two buildings for community-based retail, workforce training, and office uses in partnership with local community organizations. An adjoining community park will be included to offer outdoor gathering space for community residents. Currently, the site is bisected by the CSX railroad Altenheim Line, which is under study by DPD to convert it to a recreational trail. This development will provide ample room for the future implementation of the Altenheim Line development recently reviewed by the Committee on Design. Access to the trail would be provided from a passive recreation area on the northern half of the site. The project will likely receive TIF money to pay for environmental remediation expenses and the proposed site purchase price for the property is $1. The TIF assistance and land sale will need approval from the community Development Commission and City Council, with overall approval from the Plan Commission. Construction could begin by late 2022.

Committee on Design reviews Altenheim Line Development Plan,"The Committee on Design recently reviewed the plan for the Altenheim Line development. Currently under the initial planning phase, the project is led by the Department of Planning and Development in collaboration with the Chicago Department of Housing and Department of Transportation.  Currently owned by CSX, the rail line in question runs east to west through Homan Square and North Lawndale. The portion of the line in question runs from S. California Ave to S. Kostner Ave between W. Taylor St and W. Fillmore St. As part of the planning process, the project will study the surrounding areas, with a boundary of the Eisenhower Expressway to the north, W. Roosevelt Rd to the south, S. Washtenaw Ave to the east, and S. Cicero Ave to the west. The Invest South/West Roosevelt/Kostner RFP site will be at the western end of the trail. The proposed framework plan will explore the recreational opportunities of the elevated rail line. Additionally, it is charged with identifying the highest and best use of industrial and commercial parcels, building a sense of community ownership and control, supporting local economic growth, and developing strategies for equitable investment and anti-displacement. With a consultant team led by SOM, the project design visualizes a concept of a two-mile community art and heritage trail. Responding to the community interests in integrating local heritage and creating space for recreation, the trail will include space for history and ecology while also integrating spaces for the arts. Potential programming could include a skate park, a stage and seating for spoken word or hip hop, an outdoor cinema, and sculptures along the trail. As part of the larger study area, the plan identifies five focus areas for development in the neighborhood. Including zones dubbed Homan Square, Lawndale Plaza, Central Park Theater, Pulaski Ave, and Campus Green, these focus areas will be reimagined with potential development. Development scenarios include new housing, adaptive reuse projects, commercial, mixed-use, retail, and some light industrial uses.  Since planning work commenced in summer 2021, the project team has engaged in multiple community meetings, completed a market analysis, and developed design concepts for the line. A final plan is targeted for completion in the next couple of months, with a presentation at the Chicago Plan Commission expected at that time. Considering the long-term implementation, the city will need to pursue funding sources, negotiate and acquire the CSX rail line, and commence phase 1 engineering and design. The implementation and execution of the plan is expected to continue over a matter of years, with no final completion date determined.  ",North Lawndale,0.0
Elevated 'rails with trails' project in the works for North Lawndale,"A new linear greenway with trails and other public amenities similar to The 606 could be headed to an underutilized railway corridor in the North Lawndale community on Chicago's West Side. City officials are eying a two-mile stretch of the CSX-owned Altenheim right-of-way for the ""rails with trails"" project, which would run east-west north of Roosevelt Road between Kostner and California avenues. The proposal would utilize unused portions of the Altenheim right-of-way where the tracks have been removed. The corridor's remaining tracks would remain in operation.  The proposed greenway would connect with the city's boulevard system (Independence Blvd. would be a likely access point) and provide ""off-street pedestrian and bike connections to other neighborhood destinations"", the city said. Specific details such as the project's design, construction schedule, maintenance needs, amenities, and funding have yet to be determined. A so-called Altenheim Line Planning Study is being drafted by the city with the coordination of the departments of Planning and Development (DPD), Transportation (CDOT), Housing (DOH), and the offices of Ald.

Plan to build 250 homes in North Lawndale gets boost from city,"The City of Chicago is putting support behind a plan to build 250 single-family homes in the North Lawndale Community on the city's West Side, officials announced this week. Advocates see the initiative as a chance to address vacancy, violence, and decades of disinvestment while creating opportunities for families to build generational wealth and equity through homeownership. Dubbed the ""Reclaiming Communities Campaign,"" the program is led by a joint venture of Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives (CNI), the Lawndale Christian Development Corporation (LCDC), and United Power for Action and Justice (UPAJ). Under the plan, the team will purchase 250 vacant lots from the city for $1 each. City officials will also ""streamline the acquisition process"" and provide $5.3 million in local tax-increment financing (TIF) dollars for site remediation and lot preparation. According to a press release, United Power for Action and Justice has secured $10 million in state funding to provide an average subsidy of $30,000 to prospective homebuyers. UPAJ has funding commitments totaling $27.5 million, ""including $12.25 million from private sector sources for a revolving construction fund from JP Morgan Chase, The Steans Family Foundation, The Owens Family Foundation, Pete Villim, and The Roche Family Foundation."" ""The impact that homeownership has on building generational wealth is a benefit that has been denied to many of our Black and Brown residents on the South and West sides for far too long–not only due to historic racially discriminatory housing practices, but also due to present day lack of lending and investment,"" said Chicago Department of Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara in a statement. ""This exciting partnership is a step toward repairing the intergenerational harm of private and government wealth extraction from Black Chicagoans."" In addition to the 250 homes planned under ""Reclaiming Communities,"" the North Lawndale community is also a key area of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's INVEST South/West initiative which aims to revitalize commercial corridors in underserved neighborhoods on the city's South and West sides.

First phase of mixed-use Ogden Commons project opens in North Lawndale,"After breaking ground early last year, the first piece of the multi-phase Ogden Commons development is open for business in the 2600 block of West Ogden Avenue in the North Lawndale community. Developed as a unique partnership between The Habitat Company, Sinai Health System, Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, and the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), the project aims to bring new jobs, housing, and investment to vacant property that was once home to the now-demolished Ogden Courts public housing development. The redevelopment process started rolling when the CHA put out a Request For Proposals (RFP) for a five-acre parcel across from Mt. Sinai hospital. It became a much more comprehensive plan when Mt. Sinai and Cinespace contributed their own land to the project and joined The Habitat Company as development partners. ""The Ogden Commons was really a convergence of the rapid growth of Cinespace and a desire from Mt. Sinai—a 100-year-old neighborhood institution—to modernize and offer more services to people in the community,"" explained Jeff Head from The Habitat Company. ""A big part of that was everyone getting to know each other and coming up with a plan that focused on economic development, jobs, and housing. The RFP came at a convenient time and hastened the action."" As an initial proof of concept, the team opted to build a 30,000-square-foot commercial building first and develop the housing in later phases. The newly completed first building includes recently opened Wintrust Bank and three minority-owned restaurants—a Steak n’ Shake franchise, Momentum Coffee, and Ja Grill—that will open later this summer. The new building will also house an outpatient facility for Mt. Sinai.  The development team plans to break ground on 110 mixed-income residential units on vacant land to the immediate north later this year and build another 79 units in 2022. The entire Ogden Commons site is zoned for up to 350 units and the team plans to build at least 300. Forty percent of the residences will be designated as CHA units. Another fifty percent will be built as below-market-rate with affordable housing tax credits and the remaining 10 percent will be offered at market rate.  A goal of the project has been to hire local contractors and create jobs for North Lawndale residents. The team also aims to offer a sizable portion of the units to Mt. Sinai employees who could receive rent offsets from the hospital, according to Head. The developers are in talks with other commercial users for the additional vacant sites fronting Ogden. The $200 million Ogden Commons project isn't the only new development in the works for North Lawndale. On the opposite side of Douglass Park, the city of Chicago is currently evaluating six mixed-use proposals for a vacant lot at 3400 W. Ogden Avenue as part of its INVEST South/West program. Head said his team has been in communication with planners and will ""try to cross-pollinate"" when it comes to engaging the community and local hiring practices.  ""We see the Ogden Commons as a housing story, but it is also about a unique partnership that leveraged the strengths of different businesses to redevelop an area of the city that has long struggled,"" said Head. ""It's about activating and energizing the neighborhood.""

North Lawndale veteran apartments take shape across from Douglass Park,"After breaking ground last fall, the five-story Rauner Family Veteran Studios project is coming together in Chicago's North Lawndale community. Located at the 2900 block of West Roosevelt Road and across the street from Douglass Park, the 45,000-square-foot development recently reached its final height and received its windows. It currently awaits the installation of its white, yellow, and gray-colored exterior panels. Developed by A Safe Haven Foundation in partnership with KMA Companies, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the building will provide 90 studio apartments that will be made available to low-income, senior, and disabled military veterans. The supportive housing project gets its name from former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner and his wife Diana Rauner, who made a $1 million charitable contribution to the project. Chicago-based UrbanWorks Ltd. is behind the design, which features communal spaces for residents on the ground floor such as social service offices, a computer room, and a lounge area. There is also a landscaped outdoor patio and a green roof. The Rauner Family Veteran Studios is expected to open later this year. GMA Construction Group, a minority- and veteran-owned small business, serves as the project's general contractor.     ",North Lawndale,0.0
City Council approves mixed-use development at 3352 W. Foster,"The Chicago City Council has approved a mixed-use development at 3352 W. Foster. Located at the northeast corner of W. Foster Ave and N. Kimball Ave, the project site is currently occupied by a one-story commercial building. Planned by developer Murad Fazal and his business partners, the development will demolish the existing building to make way for the new construction. Designed by MI Darwish Architect, the new construction will be five stories tall, holding 47 apartments and 5,145 square feet of retail space. The ground floor of the building will front W. Foster Ave with the divisible retail space while orienting the residential entry towards N. Kimball Ave. The back of the ground floor will have space for 22 cars and bike storage.  Reaching 58 feet tall, the masonry building will have a unit mix of 3 studios, 32 one-beds, and 11 two-beds. Select units facing W. Foster Ave will get inset balconies.   With City Council approval, the site will be rezoned from B1-1 to B3-3 to allow for the scope of the project. Now, the developer can proceed with permitting and construction. An official timeline has not been announced. ",North Park,0.0
Danish Home of Chicago expansion breaks ground,"The Danish Home of Chicago and The Danish Home Foundation recently broke ground on a new addition to their senior living community. The groundbreaking was attended by over 100 donors, residents, and dignitaries, including Ambassador Stig Paolo Piras, the Deputy Chief of Mission for the Embassy of Denmark in Washington D.C., and Consul General Jesper Koks Andersen from the Consulate General of Denmark in Chicago.   “This new addition means a tremendous amount to many, many people: our current residents, our many Danish supporters here and across the country, our neighbors, and those who will benefit from our new spaces once we open our new addition,” said Peter Orum, Capital Campaign and The Danish Home Foundation Chairman.  Ambassador Stig Piras from the Embassy of Denmark in Washington D.C. commented, “Today we are not only laying the foundation for bricks and mortar. We’re also strengthening the ties that have bound Denmark and Chicago for many decades.   Designed by HED, the $13.5 million addition comprises five independent living one-bedroom apartments and nine additional private healthcare suites.  The dining room will be expanded and will showcase floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking magnificent gardens. The kitchen will be upgraded with modern appliances, additional preparation areas, and storage as they fundraise towards the next phase. A new bistro space will be created to encourage casual gathering and entertainment. Also, new gardens and walking paths will be added for residents to enjoy the outdoors. The community has also spruced up the living room, gathering room, and hallways.    This expansion is the fourth since the community was founded in 1891 by 12 Danish women who wanted to ensure that no one from the homeland who was living in the Chicago area would ever have to worry about growing old and being alone. This addition is made possible by the generosity of many groups and people who have generously donated over $8.7 million in cash, pledges, and an additional $3.3 million in bequests. With Berglund Construction serving as the general contractor, construction is expected to be completed in the Spring of 2025.   ",Norwood Park,0.0
Fifty new homes proposed for vacant Norwood Park site,"A development of 50 single-family homes is in the works for a vacant roughly 7.5-acre parcel in western Norwood Park on Chicago's far northwest side. Developer Lexington Homes submitted plans for the site at 7400-7404 W. Talcott Avenue, which the Chicago Plan Commission will review later this month. Dubbed ""Lexington Square"" the subdivision will straddle a new private drive located between the campus of Resurrection College Prep and the Presence Resurrection
Retirement Community. The new homes, which are designed by Chicago architecture firm Pappageorge Haymes Partners, top out at 30 feet tall and will be offered in four exterior styles utilizing a combination of fiber cement siding, brick, and stone. The development will provide at least two garage parking spaces per home (for a total of 100 residential spaces) accessed by two private rear alleys. Additionally, there will be 15 guest parking spaces located on the project's newly created north-south street. Vehicular access will come from Talcott Avenue at the south end of the development. An additional northern access point off Everell Avenue will be restricted to emergency vehicles on an ""as-needed basis,"" according to plans.   The property's underlying RS-2 Residential Single-Unit (Detached House) zoning will not change, but the project will require Lexington Homes to submit a Planned Development application to the city. If approved by the Chicago Plan Commission on August 26, the proposal will head to the Committee on Zoning and full City Council for a final vote. ",Norwood Park,0.0
Lightfoot celebrates completion of Terminal 5 expansion,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) to celebrate the grand opening of the new eastern extension of Terminal 5, a major milestone in the $1.3B, four-year investment to expand and modernize the key gateway at O'Hare International Airport. “O’Hare is a significant economic engine for our entire region and the first impression of Chicago for millions of visitors every year,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “That's why we are especially proud to cut the ribbon to this expanded, modernized Terminal 5, which represents a major milestone in O’Hare’s curb-to-gate transformation into one of the great airports of the 21st century under the O’Hare 21 capital improvement program. Importantly, this project will also build on my administration’s and CDA's ongoing commitment and efforts to create equitable, economic opportunities for Black and Brown residents, businesses, and construction and development firms.”  Designed by HOK and Muller & Muller Ltd, the light-filled redesign of the facilities maintains the integrity of the terminal’s original 1993 design while modernizing it for the 21st century. The vaulted ceilings welcome natural light and offer views across the airfield toward the Chicago skyline. The L-shaped East Concourse extension added 10 new wide-body gates, nine of which utilize multiple aircraft ramp systems, or “MARS gates.” These MARS gates allow the flexibility to accommodate larger, next-generation wide-body aircraft or more traditional narrow-body aircraft. The space it takes to park two wide-body planes can be repurposed as necessary to fit three narrow-body aircrafts.  Ten renovated gates opened in the western wing of Terminal 5 in October 2022 as the new home for Delta Air Lines, which shifted operations from the carrier's long-time home in Terminal 2. Delta's move also included the construction of a new Delta Sky Club, located between Gates M11 and M14, with more than four times the capacity of its former club in Terminal 2. Chicago’s Sky Club is also Delta’s first to feature boarding on select flights from two gates inside the lounge.  The expanded and renovated areas of Terminal 5 will also be home to a wide array of new concessions. Set to open in phases throughout 2023, local offerings will include Butcher and the Burger, Hampton Social, Bar Siena, Sparrow Coffee, and more.  Partnering with the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE), the redesign includes a public art plan that represents the city’s largest single acquisition of works by Chicago artists in 30 years. Commissions are planned across the FIS Arrival Corridor, the Baggage Claim area, and the Passenger Level Concourse.  Work began on the modernization and expansion back in 2019, with construction led by general contractor joint venture Austin Power Partners. The project increased the terminal’s capacity by 25% to improve efficiency and reduce delays. Passenger amenity space was increased by 75%, and the existing building was expanded by approximately 350,000 square feet, with additional renovations to 750,000 square feet of the existing structure.   In June 2022, work also began on a new six-story parking garage for Terminal 5, set to replace the current surface Parking Lot D. Set to complete in 2024, it will more than double the amount of available parking and include short- and long-term parking options. The garage will include parking assist technology and EV charging stations.    ",O'Hare,0.0
FAA approves O’Hare expansion plan,"Yesterday Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg joined Mayor Lori Lightfoot to announce the FAA’s approval of the new O’Hare terminal and satellite concourses. Following a thorough environmental review, The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued its findings that there is “no significant impact” to the surrounding environment, emissions should ultimately be decreased by reducing plane taxi times, and the new terminal will not adversely affect the existing historic terminal elements. The FAA decision is a culmination of a required review process that began back in 2018. “O’Hare is the lifeblood of Chicago’s economy, directly employing tens of thousands of Illinois residents and bringing more than 70 million passengers to and through our city each year,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “The next phase of work will expand O'Hare's capacity to serve travelers and improve the customer experience, transforming it into one of the greatest airports of the 21st century.”   The newly announced approval clears the way for new construction to begin. The latest plan calls for the construction of the two satellite concourses and related airfield work to begin first, once the ground thaws this spring. With Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) leading the design work, the first satellite concourse will be completed in 2027 with the second following with completion in 2028. Once opened, these satellite concourses will deliver approximately 1.3 million square feet of gates and amenity space, dramatically expanding the airport’s flexibility to accommodate both narrow and wide-body planes. Opening these facilities first will allow O’Hare to maintain gate capacity while the new global terminal is constructed. “Chicago’s transportation infrastructure is what makes this city an economic powerhouse of global importance,” said Secretary Buttigieg. “Now, as we prepare to break ground on O’Hare’s newest terminal, Chicago and this entire region will be positioned to grow and create good-paying jobs through the benefits of first-rate infrastructure, beginning with the construction project itself.”  Currently O’Hare’s oldest passenger facility, Terminal 2 is slated for demolition in phases after the satellite concourses open. Designed by Studio ORD, the construction of the O’Hare Global Terminal is slated to begin in 2026 with a 2030 completion target. Work on a large tunnel to connect passengers, baggage, and utilities between the O’Hare Global Terminal and the satellite concourses will begin in 2024 with the goal to wrap up by 2030, in line with the main terminal.  When agreed to in 2018, the cost was expected to run $8.5 billion, but 4 years and inflation later, that number has ballooned to roughly $12.1 billion. Upon its opening, the O’Hare Global Terminal will be one of the most significant terminal developments in America, more than doubling the space of the existing Terminal 2 and allowing for the integration of international and domestic operations for the airport’s two hub carriers.

8535 W Higgins approved by City Council,"The City Council followed the Committee on Zoning in approving the rezoning for the residential development at 8535 W. Higgins Road. The property is currently a parking lot for the Marriott Chicago O’Hare hotel, bound to the south by the 12-story hotel and W Higgins Road to the north. Glenstar is the developer behind the venture. Designed by FitzGerald Associates, the development will be a seven-story structure holding 297 residential units. Rising 90 feet, the project will be a three-pronged courtyard-style building with varied exterior cladding including fiber cement board, ribbed metal panels, and face brick.  The $91 million development will produce 59 affordable units on-site, making up 20% of the total units. The affordable apartments will be made up of 17 studios, 24 one-beds, and 18 two-beds.  This approval comes as a rare rebuke of aldermanic prerogative in the city. Typically, aldermen have veto power over proposed rezonings in their ward. Located in the 41st ward, the project has been opposed by Alderman Napolitano for years. The project was originally proposed in 2016 and was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission, only to be denied by the Committee on Zoning at that time at Alderman Napolitano’s request. In the years since, the alderman and a group of community members have continued to oppose the project. Glenstar resubmitted the rezoning and Planned Development application in May 2021. The Committee on Zoning voted to table the project until February 2022, but the developers got it added onto the Chicago Plan Commission meeting in August where it got approved. The Committee on Zoning approved it on Tuesday in a 12-5 vote, forwarding it to the City Council Wednesday. Ultimately, the council approved it in a 33-13 vote, officially granting the project zoning entitlements and rebuking the NW side alderman.  ",O'Hare,0.0
Checking in on O'Hare's Terminal 5 expansion ,"It's been two and half years since the Chicago Department of Aviation broke ground on a planned renovation and expansion of Terminal 5 at O'Hare International Airport. The $1.2 billion project is starting to come together, according to aerial photos courtesy of subcontractor FH Paschen. The wedge-shaped addition will span 350,000 square feet and provide 10 new gates to increase the terminal's gate capacity by 25 percent. A further 750,000 square feet within the existing structure is also being remodeled to accommodate expanded security checkpoints, reconfigured immigration and customs, improved baggage handling systems, and space for airline lounges, concessions, and other passenger amenities. Although T5 is primarily currently used by overseas carriers, the renovation will allow it to handle both international and domestic flights. Delta Airlines is expected to make the move to Terminal 5 from its current location at Terminal 2 once the project is complete. Construction should wrap up near the end of 2021 and welcome passengers in 2022.  The Terminal 5 redo is designed by Chicago architecture firm Muller2 in collaboration with HOK and T.Y. Lin International. Construction work is being overseen by the shagadelicly-named Austin Power Partners—a joint venture comprising Austin Commercial, Power Construction Company, and Ujamaa Construction. The renovated T5 is just one piece of the much larger $8.5 billion O'Hare 21 plan to modernize the airport to fit the needs of the 21st century. The crown jewel in the effort will be the eventual construction of the O'Hare Global Terminal—designed by a team lead by Studio Gang Architects—slated to replace Terminal 2. The plan also includes an underground connection to a pair of new satellite terminals designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. ",O'Hare,0.0
Apartments near O'Hare moving forward without alderman's support,"Members of the Chicago Plan Commission and Ald. Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward) faced off this week over a proposed 297-unit apartment project near O'Hare International Airport. Disregarding ""aldermanic prerogative,"" the longstanding and unofficial practice of giving city council members the final say on zoning matters within their respective wards, the commission approved the $91 million project against the wishes of Napolitano as well as fellow northwest side Ald. Nick Sposato (38th Ward). Thursday's vote was the second time the Chicago Plan Commission granted developer GlenStar preliminary zoning approval for the project at 8535 W. Higgins Road, which has been under consideration since late 2016. The commissioners signed off on the project in 2017, but the city's Zoning Committee later shot down the proposal at the request of Ald. Napolitano. GlenStar filed—and eventually dropped—a lawsuit against the city. 

 Sposato and Napolitano argued that the project would bring too much density to the vacant site near the Marriott Chicago O’Hare, the Kennedy Expressway, and the CTA Cumberland Blue Line station. The aldermen also raised concerns about school overcrowding (though most of the proposed units will be offered as studios and one-bedrooms).  Napolitano even emailed local residents urging them to speak against the development at Thursday's meeting. However, zero members of the public signed up to voice opposition to Glenstar's plan. Proponents of the project, including Chicago Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox and Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara, pushed back on criticisms and argued that building denser housing near transit is a citywide policy that should be applied independently of ward boundaries, especially in neighborhoods with a deficit of newer mixed-income multifamily housing.  ""Wherever we see effective access to transit, we advocate for higher density housing,"" said Commissioner Cox. ""This project does exactly that. It provides housing choice so that people who work at O'Hare have a shorter commute."" 

 Designed by FitzGerald Associates Architects, the project at 8535 W. Higgins Road has changed little over the past four-plus years. The structure still features an E-shaped layout with two courtyards (though some exterior textured metal and fiber cement panels changed colors). The proposed building will include amenities such as a fitness center and dog run. Although located next to transit, the project is not seeking a reduction in parking or a boost in density under the city's Transit-Oriented Development Ordinance. The development will provide 270 parking spaces as well as ""enhanced pedestrian access"" to the nearby Blue Line stop. The developers will also voluntarily exceed the city's current 10 percent affordable housing rules by providing 20 percent of the apartments (59 units) at below-market rates. The previous version included just seven affordable units.  Before work can begin on the apartment complex at 8535 W. Higgins Road, the project's Planned Development application will need to pass both the Committee on Zoning. Napolitano has already introduced a measure to delay the committee vote.  If the plan manages does manage to get a hearing, it is likely to reignite the debate over aldermanic prerogative versus citywide policy. Stay tuned.  ",O'Hare,0.0
Can this luxury Oak Brook rental tower bring 'city vibes' to the burbs?,"It used to be if you wanted to rent in a downtown-quality luxury apartment building you had to live, well, downtown. That could soon change with the arrival of a new 17-story rental tower slated for the former McDonald's corporate campus in suburban Oak Brook. Dubbed One Oak Brook Commons, the Hines-developed property has all the bells and whistles of downtown high-rise... and prices that aren't too far from its urban counterparts. ""It's really about bringing the city vibe out to the suburbs,"" said Aaron Galvin, CEO and founder of Luxury Living Chicago Realty, which is handling the marketing and leasing for the property. ""That's true of the apartments themselves, the amenities, and the service offerings."" All 250 apartments sport high-end contemporary finishes, including quartz countertops, under-cabinet lighting, wide-plank wood flooring, and walk-in closets. A resort-style amenities deck features a heated pool, cabanas, outdoor kitchens, and a lawn. Residents will also have access to a fitness center, club room, library, dog run, and an indoor sports lounge with a golf simulator. At 17-stories, the Antunovich Associates-designed high-rise will provide views back to the city that other rental properties simply cannot match. The building will, however, include a not-so-urban 420 parking spaces in its podium garage. Rents at One Oak Brook Commons will be at the ""very high-end of the suburban market,"" Galvin said. One-bedrooms will rent for $2,395 per month, while two-bedroom units start at $3,395, and three-bedrooms for $4,750. Oak Brook is an affluent enough area to absorb those prices, Galvin insists. Although preleasing doesn't begin until later this year, the project's website has seen ""significant demand"" with hundreds of people signing up for an early-access VIP list, according to Galvin.  ""There was this narrative of a migration out of the city to the suburbs during COVID, and that benefitted the suburban properties,"" Galvin explained. ""Obviously we've seen the city recover in a major way: occupancy is in the 95 percent-plus range and pricing is back to pre-COVID levels. But the suburbs just never took that dip. There's demand that wasn't able to be met during the pandemic. The timing couldn't be better for a project like this."" Initial occupancy of One Oak Brook Commons is expected in early 2022. The tower sits at the center of the larger 16.5-acre Oak Brook Common master development which includes additional offices, condos, hotels, restaurants, and medical uses. There's also a new public park space dubbed ""The Pitch.""  ",Oak Brook,0.0
Oak Park cuts ribbon on new recreation center,"Oak Park has cut the ribbon on its new Community Recreation Center, a 42,000-square-foot facility just outside of Chicago. Located at 229 Madison Street, the community building is billed as an anchor for future revitalization in the area. The building, which was designed by Perkins&Will following community surveys and meetings with residents during the course of the pandemic, is a three-story structure composed of brick, metal, and glass. The Community Recreation Center's offerings include a fitness center, an indoor gym, a walking track, and meeting rooms. A central component to the Community Recreation Center is a three-story atrium, which features a bright yellow column which matches the coloring of hallways and walkways throughout the building. A staircase in the building lobby provides vertical circulation for the recreation center, while a bridge at the second floor connects the fitness center to other exercise spaces - and the Community Mental Health Board's offices. The walking track is likewise suspended above the gym with views of the Chicago skyline. “One of the guiding principles of our design approach was conveying the activity and enthusiasm of the building from within,” says Perkins&Will design director for Chicago, Bryan Schabel. “The building is intentionally transparent along Madison Avenue: we made bold and bright color choices – the signature yellow is sure to grab passersby's attention, and you can’t help but ask what is happening in there?  It’s an energetic and vibrant new landmark building for Oak Park.” Besides recreation, the property also includes new offices for the Community Mental Health Board, which provides in-take and referral sources, space for free after-school programs, an e-sports lounge, bathrooms, and locker rooms. Perkins&Will designed the Community Recreation Center to fit on a tight site by pushing programming upward, placing the gym on the second floor. While the building takes advantage of its location along Madison Avenue to the north, it also emphasizes privacy by placing its main corridor along the exterior to buffer spaces for children. However, natural light still streams into the interior through extensive exterior glazing. On the exterior, the building features masonry at the ground floor and metal panels above. Some of that exterior is home to the mural Stories of Our Neighborhood, which shows Oak Park history. ",Oak Park,0.0
Seven-story senior living development takes shape in Oak Park ,"A seven-story senior housing development recently topped off in Oak Park. Located about eight miles west of downtown Chicago at 703 Madison Street, the 253,000-square-foot project comes from Michigan-based developer Redico and will feature 177 senior living units offered as studios, one- and two-bedroom apartments as well as shared rooms.

Twelve luxury apartments headed to vacant lot in Oakland,"Developer Jennings Realty is close to breaking ground on a four-level, 12-unit luxury apartment project at 4012 S. Ellis Avenue, the company revealed at a virtual meeting hosted by Ald. Sophia King (4th) and the North Kenwood-Oakland Advisory Council (NKOAC).   Designed by Alexander Polichuk Architects, the upcoming project replaces a vacant lot in the Oakland community within Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood. The masonry and limestone structure will contain six one-bedrooms renting for around $1,500 per month and six two-bedroom units starting at $2,000. The largest apartments will be ""duplex-downs"" occupying the first and lower levels.  The plan includes residential balconies on the front and rear of the new building plus a large rooftop deck. Every apartment will have 9-foot ceilings and finishes ""consistent with what is being developed as single-family homes and condominiums,"" said Ivan Mariduena of Jennings Realty. The development team intends to hold the South Side property long-term, according to Mariduena.  The development also calls for a detached, single-story rear garage structure with parking for 12 cars. Some neighbors attending the virtual NKOAC meeting, however, questioned if one space per apartment was adequate off-street parking since half of the proposed residences will have two bedrooms each. The project slated for 4012 S. Ellis is not seeking a zoning change or financial assistance from the city and therefore is not required to provide any below-market-rate units. The developers said they are close to finalizing their architectural drawings and hope to apply for permits and break ground soon. ",Oakland,0.0
Four-story apartment project headed to vacant lot on 43rd Street,"It's always encouraging to see vacant land bite the dust for new infill development.

Dermatology, endocrinology and gynecology will be added in 2024. “Patients are now able to receive primary and specialty care in Old Irving Park, close to where they live and work,” said Leonardo Vargas, MD, medical director of the Northwestern Medicine Old Irving Park Outpatient Center. “We’re delighted to provide the services patients need within their community and to create jobs in the Old Irving Park area.” Designed by CannonDesign, the 160,000-square-foot-building also features on-site parking with 350 spaces and a sustainable design with eight electric vehicle charging stations, three green roofs and low-emitting materials used throughout the building. Power Construction served as the general contractor. ",Old Irving Park,0.0
Northwestern Medicine coming to Old Irving Park,"Construction permits have been issued for an upcoming medical office building run by Northwestern Medicine. Located at 4445 W. Irving Park Rd, the project will span the full block from N Kenneth Avenue to N Kilbourn Avenue.  With a design from CannonDesign, the project will build a four-story medical center. The building’s design will employ an articulation of edges and carving of the volume to line up the building with prominent datums in the nearby community. The design of the front facade will be separated into three segments, with one section for the entrance that brings in light through a glass facade that brightens the space, a center section that is more solid and holds the Northwestern logo, and a final section that screens the parking garage ramps. 350 parking spaces will be provided within the building. At the corner of W. Irving Park Rd and N. Kenneth Ave, the main entry will be setback from the street and feature an outdoor plaza. Measuring 2,400 square feet, the plaza will include seating, bike racks, and greenery. A 24,000 square feet green roof will top the building. To meet sustainability requirements, the project will achieve LEED Silver status, include EV charging stations, reduce light spill, use low-emitting materials, complete 80 percent construction waste diversion, and use bird-friendly glass with a low-e coating. The site went through a rezoning process from B3-1 and RS-2 to a consistent B3-3 in April 2021. Expected to cost $150 million, the construction of the project will be led by Power Construction. Groundbreaking was originally expected for Fall 2021 but is now likely to begin in the New Year. A permit for the tower crane was also issued at the end of October. ",Old Irving Park,1.0
Commissary Market will take over Treasure Island space in Old Town,"Developer Fern Hill recently announced that they have struck a deal with 1350 Commissary Market to give them a new home in the former Treasure Island retail space just north of their proposed 36-story mixed-use development that is currently under consideration by the community and Alderman Hopkins. As they continue to identify a larger tenant for the Treasure Island parcel on Wells St., the Old Town Commissary Market will be a co-tenant with Walgreens, which will temporarily relocate to a portion of the existing retail space while its new flagship location is constructed. For 45 years, the family-owned and operated market served as a convenient grocery store and offered a mix of upscale and everyday offerings to customers. The Old Town Commissary Market will be larger than the previous Gold Coast location and will bring much needed offerings to the neighborhood, including an expanded selection of groceries, a full-scale deli with home cooked meals, and other necessities.  Through the agreement, the Old Town Commissary Market will operate in the Treasure Island space with the option to move into a new retail location at the base of the proposed residential building as soon as a larger tenant is identified.   Designed by GREC Architects, the proposed larger mixed-use tower at 1600 N. LaSalle will rise 36 stories to a height of 395 feet. The building is proposed to have a total of 500 rental units, with 100 of them, or 20%, set aside as affordable at or below 60% AMI.  At the ground floor, Walgreens will occupy 14,000 square feet of new retail space at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Wells St. Another retail space will occupy the opposite corner at W. North Ave and N. LaSalle Dr. The residential lobby will be located in the center of the project’s street frontage along W. North Ave. The north end of the N. LaSalle Dr frontage will have a single vehicular access point for residential parking, parking for Moody Church, and loading access. There will be 150 parking spaces for the residential units and 300 dedicated exclusively for Moody Church. The larger development is still under consideration by the community and Alderman Hopkins and will need a series of approval from the City to move forward. ",Old Town,0.0
Fern Hill seeks feedback on 1600 N. LaSalle,"Fern Hill and GREC Architects are seeking feedback from the community regarding a series of design options for the podium facade of their latest development planned at 1600 N. LaSalle. Currently occupied by the existing Walgreens store and a surface parking lot, the project site is bounded by N. Wells St to the west, W. North Ave to the south, and N. LaSalle Dr to the east. Announced at the end of September, the development will comprise of a mixed-use tower that will rise 36 stories to a height of 395 feet. The building will have a total of 500 rental units, with 100 of them, or 20%, set aside as affordable at or below 60% AMI.  At the ground floor, Walgreens will be right sizing their space and will occupy 14,000 square feet of new retail space at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Wells St. Another retail space will occupy the opposite corner at W. North Ave and N. LaSalle Dr. The residential lobby will be located in the center of the project’s street frontage along W. North Ave. The north end of the N. LaSalle Dr frontage will have a single vehicular access point for residential parking, parking for Moody Church, and loading access. There will be 150 parking spaces for the residential units and 300 dedicated exclusively for Moody Church. The tower has been designed to fit into its context, with podium buildings that reference the surrounding heights and are finished in a facade treatment that is inspired by the vocabulary of surrounding buildings. Rather than the solid brick facade that exists currently, the new ground floor facade will be highly transparent to activate the pedestrian experience and bring a sense of safety to the area.  As part of the design process, GREC Architects has studied a number of directions for the portion of the building fronting Wells Street. The below options represent potential design directions for the Well St. podium facade. Neighbors and those interested can share feedback on the design options on Fern Hill’s community engagement website.  ",Old Town,0.0
Fern Hill reveals 395-foot-tall tower at 1600 N. LaSalle,"Fern Hill revealed their proposal for a mixed-use development at 1600 N. LaSalle last night at a 2nd Ward community meeting. After initially announcing their plans back in October 2021, the developers returned in February to detail their takeaways from their community engagement in the form of a development framework.  Split into two zones, the developer identified the parcel framed by N. LaSalle Dr, N. Clark St, and W. North Ave as the cultural triangle, whose gas stations would only be redeveloped with structures matching the 50-foot datum of the Moody Church. With the Moody Church parking lot and Walgreens property under consideration to the west of N. LaSalle Dr, Fern Hill will be focusing the density of the project onto this parcel. Designed by GREC Architects, the new mixed-use tower will rise 36 stories to a height of 395 feet. The building will have a total of 500 rental units, with 100 of them, or 20%, set aside as affordable at or below 60% AMI.  At the ground floor, Walgreens will be right sizing their space and will occupy 14,000 square feet of new retail space at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Wells St. Another retail space will occupy the opposite corner at W. North Ave and N. LaSalle Dr. The residential lobby will be located in the center of the project’s street frontage along W. North Ave. The north end of the N. LaSalle Dr frontage will have a single vehicular access point for residential parking, parking for Moody Church, and loading access. There will be 150 parking spaces for the residential units and 300 dedicated exclusively for Moody Church. The tower has been designed to fit into its context, with podium buildings that reference the surrounding heights and are finished in a facade treatment that is inspired by the vocabulary of surrounding buildings. Rather than the solid brick facade that exists currently, the new ground floor facade will be highly transparent to activate the pedestrian experience and bring a sense of safety to the area.  Rising as a rectangular tower intersecting with the contextual base, the residential volume has been designed with inspiration from the modernist lakefront towers, activated with the concept of building as painting. Using the abstraction of a sunrise on the lakefront as inspiration, color is added to the building’s facade to make it unique and memorable.  Fern Hill also addressed the future of the Treasure Island retail space, telling community members that they have been actively searching for a new grocery tenant and have no interest in keeping the space vacant. Despite their efforts, they have been unable to sign a tenant up to this point, but referenced the fact that potential grocers were listening to the community meeting and are likely waiting to see the result of this community process to see if more density and activity would be coming to this area. When asked about next steps, the development team said that there is no specific timeline and that they are expecting conversations around the proposal to continue with the community, Alderman Hopkins, and city department staff. While not specifically discussed, the project will likely need a rezoning and possible Planned Development designation to be able to move forward with construction if approved by Alderman Hopkins.

Alderman Hopkins denies zoning change for 1542 N. Wells,"After hosting a community meeting in June, Alderman Hopkins has announced his decision to deny the zoning change proposed at 1542 N. Wells. Fronting N. Wells St, the project site is a 50-foot-wide lot with no alley access. Proposed by Zach Waickman of GLP, the site is currently occupied by a one-story building and a two-story building. With UrbanWorks in charge of the design, the five-story building was designed to fit into the neighborhood character, sporting a dark gray brick facade, topped with a dark metal cornice and articulated with a dark stone base. Punched windows openings interrupted the masonry on the upper residential floors, while a glass storefront system enclosed the ground-floor retail space. A line of balconies was inset into the street-facing facade for select units in the building. The preliminary design called for 16 residential units on the upper floors, with four rental apartments per level. The unit mix consisted of 8 one-bedrooms measuring 675 square feet and 8 two-bedrooms measuring 900 square feet. The four two-bedroom units facing the street would have had the select units with balconies. With the structure topping out at 50 feet tall, no roof access would be provided for any of the apartments. On the ground floor, the residential entry was planned for the north end of the street frontage, with trash and recycling access at the south side of the frontage due to the lack of alley access. Due to the tight nature of the site and lack of alley access, the building would have had no car parking, but included bike parking for residents.  The remainder of the ground floor was set to provide 2,175 square feet of retail space planned as a cannabis dispensary. As a highly regulated retail tenant, the space would have been designed to have a security lobby at the front where patrons would have to show proof of age before being allowed to enter a second room which houses the sales floor for the dispensary.  After the community meeting, the Old Town Residents and Merchants Association conducted a community survey which yielded over 200 responses. Approximately 25% were in favor, 70% were opposed, and the remaining 5% were neutral. Between the survey results and numerous comments received, Alderman Hopkins decided to deny the request to change the zoning from B3-5 to C1-5. ",Old Town,0.0
Eugenie Lane Apartments get final landmark recommendation,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the Eugenie Lane Apartments. Located at 235 W. Eugenie, the rental residences were built in 1962 with a design from Ben Weese.  The building meets Criterion 1 for heritage as it reflects the architectural heritage of Old Town in the 1960s and 1970s, when the neighborhood established itself as a place for artists and the creative community. During the 1960s and 1970s, Chicago architects of the modern era like Ben Weese designed small-scale residential infill buildings in the historic 19th century neighborhood adding an important layer to its built environment. Meeting Criterion 4 for exemplary architecture, the modern-era building has a clear expression of its residential function, absence of ornament, and large windows. The design of the building references architectural elements from the 19th century neighborhood in which it stands including its Chicago common brick walls, louvered accents and standing-seam metal mansard roof. Built at a time when new apartments tended to be in tall towers, the design of the Eugenie Lane Apartments settles for tree-top height and a more human scale. The final criterion the project meets is Criterion 5 for being a work of a significant architect. Ben Weese designed the Eugenie Lane Apartments toward the beginning of a long and rich career in architecture. Though the building may be considered one the architect’s early works, the design of Eugenie Lane Apartments reflects principles that Ben Weese would hone throughout his career including the preference for simple, vernacular materials; responding to context, and a willingness to borrow from history while designing in a modern idiom. Ben Weese was a member of the Chicago Seven, a group of young Chicago architects that formed in the 1970s to educate the public about a more pluralistic view of Chicago’s architecture and to explore new directions at an inflection point in American architecture at the end of the modern movement.  Meeting the Integrity Criterion, the Eugenie Lane Apartments retains more than sufficient historic integrity to express its historic and architectural value to the City of Chicago. It remains in its original location and the residential setting around the building has changed little since the building was constructed in 1962. Changes to the exterior include the recent repair of louvered ventilation panels to match the original. Based on its evaluation of the Eugenie Lane Apartments, the Commission staff recommends that the significant features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building. With the final landmark recommendation approved by the commission, the proposed designation will head to City Hall to get votes from the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council. If approved, the building will officially be shielded from demolition. ",Old Town,0.0
CHA submits zoning application for 1401 N. Clybourn,"The Chicago Housing Authority has submitted a rezoning application for its long-vacant site which was once home to the former Cabrini-Green housing project. Planned for a wedge-shaped lot, the site is bound by N. Clybourn Ave to the south, N. Larrabee St to the east, and rededicated N. Ogden Ave and W. Blackhawk St to the west and north respectively. The multi-phase venture is being developed by CHA in collaboration with Hunt Development Group, Pennrose, Imagine Group, and a Cabrini-Green residents group. With JGMA on board for the design, the project documents show a multi-phase, mixed-use development that will occupy the entire site. Once fully built out, the project will deliver 742 residential units and 22,000 square feet of retail space spread across multiple buildings with 174 surface parking spaces organized on the site between buildings. The first phase, Subarea C, will deliver 345 units in two buildings, while Subarea B is planned for 216 units and Subarea D will bring 181 dwelling units. Designed as a cohesive group of buildings, each structure will feature rounded corners and bent-shaped forms. Facades will be clad in metal panels with integral standing seams and window wall glazing. Integrated balconies will be set into the facade of the buildings. With varying heights, Phase 1 will have a 10-story building standing 98 feet tall and an eight-story midrise rising 79 feet tall. While CHA typically builds mixed-income projects, the zoning application doesn’t specify an exact breakdown of unit types or income levels. Due to the fact that they will be funding the project with LIHTC equity, TIF funding, and other revenue streams, the affordable percentage will be higher than the typical ARO requirements because these funding sources require a higher percentage of affordable units. CHA and its team are looking to rezone the site from its existing Planned Development and RT-4 designation to a unified C1-3 before implementing a new Planned Development. The plan will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. Further hearings on the approval of financing can also be expected. ",Old Town,1.0

Developer plans mixed-use development at 1542 N. Wells,"A mixed-use development has been proposed at 1542 N. Wells. Fronting N. Wells St, the project site is a 50-foot-wide lot with no alley access. Currently occupied by a one-story building and a two-story building, the property would be cleared to make way for the new construction. Zach Waickman of GLP is the developer behind the proposal. With UrbanWorks in charge of the architecture, the five-story building has been designed to fit into the neighborhood character, sporting a dark gray brick facade, topped with a dark metal cornice and articulated with a dark stone base. Punched windows openings will interrupt the masonry on the upper residential floors, while a glass storefront system will enclose the ground-floor retail space.

On the ground floor, the residential entry will be at the north end of the street frontage, with trash and recycling access at the south side of the frontage due to the lack of alley access. Due to the tight nature of the site and lack of alley access, the building will have no car parking, but will include bike parking for residents.  The remainder of the ground floor will provide 2,175 square feet of retail space that is currently planned to house a cannabis dispensary. As a highly regulated retail tenant, the space would be designed to have a security lobby at the front where patrons would have to show proof of age before being allowed to enter a second room which houses the sales floor for the dispensary. The developer reassured community members that they would be following all state laws that govern dispensaries which include a highly detailed security plan that involves private security being on-site during business hours. The developer is seeking to rezone the site from B3-5 to C1-5, due to the fact that cannabis dispensaries are not a permitted use in the B- zoning districts. The rezoning would need approval from the alderman, Committee on Zoning, and City Council before the project could move forward. Beyond the rezoning, cannabis dispensaries also require a hearing before and an approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals to operate, at which time the developer and their future dispensary operator would resolve the details of running the dispensary. At this preliminary stage of the proposal, a specific timeline for approvals and construction could not be outlined by the developer. ",Old Town,0.0
Full building permit issued for 1505 N. Sedgwick,"A full building permit has been issued for a mixed-use development at 1505 N. Sedgwick. Located on a midblock site, the narrow property is located within a two-minute walk of the Sedgwick Brown Line stop. Developed by 1507 N Sedgwick LLC, a demolition permit issued in May paved the way to clear the way for the new construction.  Designed by Hanna Architects, the new building will stand four floors high, with 4 residential units and 800 square feet of office space that will front the street. The four residential units will include one three-bed duplex down at the back of the ground floor, while the remaining three residential units will occupy one floor each, all of them 3-bedroom configurations. 12 bike parking spaces will be located along the alley. The project received a series of approvals from the Zoning Board of Appeals in February, including a special use to allow for residential use below the second floor, a variation to reduce the rear setback from 30 feet down to 6 feet, and a variation to reduce the required parking spaces from four to zero as the site is a transit-served location. With the full building permit issued, general contractor 5 Seasons Development Company can begin work on the building. A timeline for completion is currently unknown. ",Old Town,0.0
City Council approves landmarking of Netsch House,"The Chicago City Council has approved the landmark designation of the Netsch House. Located at 1700 N. Hudson, the home was built by Walter Netsch in 1974 for him and his wife Dawn Clark Netsch. The home sits within the Old Town Triangle Historic District although it is currently not listed as a contributing building.  Meeting Criterion 1 for the home’s heritage, the Netsch House was part of a collection of houses built by architects in the 1970s, attracted by the area’s rich cultural context. Established in 1947, the Old Town Triangle Association, which is still active today, supported the artistic character of the neighborhood with its annual art fair. In 1958, the Chicago Tribune called Old Town Triangle Chicago’s Left Bank. The second criterion the house meets is Criterion 3, for its association with a significant person. Dawn Clark Netsch, the wife of Walter Netsch, lived from 1926 until 2013. She studied politics and law at Northwestern University and was the only and first woman to graduate in her class of 1952. She became the first female faculty there and in 1969 was elected to the Illinois Constitutional Convention. In 1973, she was the first woman elected to the Illinois State Senate and spent 18 years in office. In 1994, she was the first woman to run for governor, although she did not win.  The house also meets Criterion 4 for its status as a piece of exemplary architecture. Designed by Walter Netsch, the home is a clear expression of his own Field Theory. The exterior is restrained, while the interior exhibits the drama of the design. The interior is essentially a 30-foot-tall cube with living spaces arranged as platforms that radiate and spiral up from a center core. The vaulted roof is made up of a frame structure of overlaid squares.  The final criterion is Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect. Walter Netsch was born and raised in South Shore and received his architectural degree from MIT in 1943. After serving in World War 2, he returned and joined SOM in 1947 where he spent his entire career. Netsch quickly moved up within the firm and was put in charge of high profile projects, establishing a reputation as a skilled planner for large, complex projects. He later developed his philosophy of Field Theory, which was a process of using overlaid grids to produce lattices that were the beginnings of floor plans and elevations. The most complete expression is his master plan at the University of Illinois Chicago and specifically the Behavioral Sciences Building which clearly shows the lattice form and plan arrangement.  The house also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. Walter and Dawn Clark Netsch lived in the home their entire lives and was only passed to new owners after Dawn Clark Netsch died in 2013. During their time in the house, the Netsch's added a bay window to the south elevation. More recently, the new owners hired SOM to do a careful restoration and renovation to the house, protecting the design while updating the finishes. The significant features set to be protected include all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as parts of the interior. Those include the overall spatial volume of the home as well as aspects of Field Theory and materials that are significant including the central tower and arrangement of living spaces.  With the final landmark designation approved, the home is officially a landmark and is protected from demolition both on the exterior and interior.

Fern Hill presents development outline for North + LaSalle,"Developer Fern Hill presented an outline of their development surrounding the corner of W. North Ave and N. LaSalle St. After initially announcing their plans back in October 2021, the developers returned to detail their takeaways from over a year of community engagement via multiple meetings and their website https://www.engagefernhill.com/.  After the extensive community engagement process, Fern Hill has identified eight common themes:   Anchored by Moody Church, the Chicago History Museum, and the Latin School of Chicago, Fern Hill identified this area as the Cultural Triangle. It’s currently challenged by the surrounding auto-dominated streets and gas stations at key corners, creating a hostile space for pedestrians. Additionally, area institutions currently deal with congested drop-off and delivery operations.  To improve the area, the project proposes a road diet along N. Clark St between N. LaSalle Dr and W. North Ave. Wider sidewalks will encourage pedestrian use, while the narrower street will calm traffic and promote biking. The plan would rework the drop-off and delivery strategies to improve operations for area institutions and neighbors.  To develop the Cultural Triangle, Fern Hill proposed limiting any new construction to a contextual height limit that matches Moody Church. While they don’t own the Wintrust property, Fern Hill believes any kind of high rise would not be the appropriate response for this site.  Considered the Old Town Triangle, this second portion includes the parking lot at W. North Ave and N. LaSalle St and the Treasure Island retail space. With the empty Treasure Island space, Fern Hill is actively working to get a grocer back into the space. They are currently in conversation with a few brands, but they have not been able to close a deal yet due to the challenging physical structure, which is owned by the 1660 N. LaSalle Condo Association.  Planning a unified development, Fern Hill has planned to consolidate the new development to the parking lot at the northwest corner of W. North Ave and N. LaSalle Dr. Placing the new development here will preserve adjacent historic structures as well as preserve views from adjacent residential towers.   With no specific plans shown for the new construction, a representative from Fern Hill explained that they will continue with stakeholder meetings in February and March before presenting renderings and plans for the new building later this spring. Adjaye Associates will be designing the new architecture in collaboration with local architect GREC Architects. ",Old Town,0.0

Established in 1947, the Old Town Triangle Association, which is still active today, supported the artistic character of the neighborhood with its annual art fair. In 1958, the Chicago Tribune called Old Town Triangle Chicago’s Left Bank. The second criterion the house meets is Criterion 3, for its association with a significant person. Dawn Clark Netsch, the wife of Walter Netsch, lived from 1926 until 2013. She studied politics and law at Northwestern University and was the only and first woman to graduate in her class of 1952. She became the first female faculty there and in 1969 was elected to the Illinois Constitutional Convention. In 1973, she was the first woman elected to the Illinois State Senate and spent 18 years in office. In 1994, she was the first woman to run for governor, although she did not win.  The house also meets Criterion 4 for its status as a piece of exemplary architecture. Designed by Walter Netsch, the home is a clear expression of his own Field Theory. The exterior is restrained, while the interior exhibits the drama of the design. The interior is essentially a 30-foot-tall cube with living spaces arranged as platforms that radiate and spiral up from a center core. The vaulted roof is made up of a frame structure of overlaid squares.  The final criterion is Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect. Walter Netsch was born and raised in South Shore and received his architectural degree from MIT in 1943. After serving in World War 2, he returned and joined SOM in 1947 where he spent his entire career. Netsch quickly moved up within the firm and was put in charge of high profile projects, establishing a reputation as a skilled planner for large, complex projects. He later developed his philosophy of Field Theory, which was a process of using overlaid grids to produce lattices that were the beginnings of floor plans and elevations. The most complete expression is his master plan at the University of Illinois Chicago and specifically the Behavioral Sciences Building which clearly shows the lattice form and plan arrangement.  The house also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. Walter and Dawn Clark Netsch lived in the home their entire lives and was only passed to new owners after Dawn Clark Netsch died in 2013. During their time in the house, the Netschs added a bay window to the south elevation. More recently, the new owners hired SOM to do a careful restoration and renovation to the house, protecting the design while updating the finishes. The significant features set to be protected include all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as parts of the interior. Those include the overall spatial volume of the home as well as aspects of Field Theory and materials that are significant including the central tower and arrangement of living spaces.  With the preliminary landmark recommendation approved, the next step for the designation would be a report and final landmark recommendation from the Commission. With that final recommendation, the proposed designation would be submitted to City Hall, voted on by the Committee on Zoning, and ultimately approved by the Chicago City Council.  ",Old Town,0.0
Work imminent on hotel project at 1528 N. Wells,"The first permit has been issued for a long-awaited hotel development at 1528 N. Wells. Originally approved back in September 2020, the project has been quiet up until now, with a foundation permit issued for the building, indicating that work will begin imminently. Developed by Condor Partners, the project will reoccupy a currently vacant site along N. Wells St.  Designed by Pappageorge Haymes, the project will see the construction of a 12-story hotel tower. Rising 151 feet, the boutique hotel will include 203 rooms with interiors designed by Summer Thornton. The building has been designed with a classic masonry exterior punctured by 8-foot-tall windows, with outdoor terraces on top of the massing’s multiple setbacks. Three levels of parking will rise at the back of the site, with access via a curb cut on N. Wells St.  Dubbed The Duke of Wells, hotel guests will have access to 4.5 star amenities including a rooftop lounge with expansive views of Chicago and Lake Michigan, a spa, a fitness center, and a world-class restaurant.  While not part of the permit, the development will see the construction of two large single-family homes along N. Wieland St to screen the parking structure that will stand behind the hotel tower. Oriented north/south to act as the screens, the homes will render the parking nearly invisible from sight while creating new homes to close the gap along N. Wieland St.  With the foundation permit issued, general contractor McHugh Construction can begin work on the site. A timeline for the project is currently unknown.  ",Old Town,0.0

Developer taps starchitect David Adjaye for massive Old Town project,"Chicago developer Fern Hill has enlisted famous starchitect Sir David Adjaye to envision a massive, multi-parcel redevelopment plan near the intersection of North Avenue and LaSalle Drive in Old Town. The developer introduced the Ghanaian-British designer—who is perhaps best known on this side of the Atlantic for the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington D.C.—at a community webinar hosted by Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) earlier this week. ""With a project of this scale and importance, it's allowed us to engage one of the most prolific design architects in the world,"" said Fern Hill's Mike Ellch. ""We're extremely excited to have the opportunity to work with a designer that puts an emphasis on place, on culture, and above all, designing places where people want to live and spend time."" The meeting did not discuss specific plans for the Old Town sites, which include The Moody Church and parking lot, the Walgreens and the vacant Treasure Island grocery store on Wells, and nearby Shell and BP gas stations. Moody Church will partner with Fern Hill on the northside project. Before any plans are shown to the public, the team intends to collect feedback from residents and other local stakeholders through what Ald. Hopkins called ""the most interactive community review process for any development in the city of Chicago."" The developers intend to launch an online platform for collecting information using surveys as well as a map on which members of the public can leave feedback.  ""I think what we have here is an opportunity to do something very good for the city, but that will only happen if the community will accept what is ultimately put before you at the end of this design process,"" Hopkins told residents. ""I welcome your involvement and look forward to a very robust dialogue. I'm particularly excited about the interactive tool. I think it's going to make my job as alderman much easier, and it will give you a way to play a more active role in this [development]."" Fern Hill says it will launch the interactive website for the North and LaSalle project in the coming weeks. The development team expects to present Adjaye's vision for the parcels to the community in early 2022.  ""We know Chicago very well, and we're big fans of the city, which has this extraordinary heritage and lineage in architecture,"" added David Adjaye. ""We're deeply inspired by this incredible city and the ability to be to work in Old Town: to understand its context and its neighborhood, but also to make what will be a signature development in the city.""

City Council approves Casa Yucatan,"The Chicago City Council has approved the affordable residential development dubbed Casa Yucatan. Planned by The Resurrection Project, the development is addressed at 2136 S. Ashland at the southwestern corner of S. Ashland Ave and W. 21st Pl. Designed by local firm DesignBridge, the all-affordable development will stand 8 floors tall with a precast facade and structure organized in a U-shaped massing. After initially having an L-shaped design, the massing changed to a U-shape to accommodate more green space on the site and to allow for a stepping down of the massing from 8 floors along S. Ashland Ave to 4 floors adjacent to neighborhood homes to the west of the site. Planned to have 98 apartments, the unit mix will include 38 one-beds, 34 two-beds, and 26 three-beds. The developer is using income averaging to provide 26 of the units at 30% AMI, 10 units at 15% AMI and some at 70% AMI to reach a weighted average of 60% AMI. The first floor will hold a community room and space for The Resurrection Project’s programming in rooms along S. Ashland Ave. The residential entry will be at the inset of the building massing with a handful of units at the west side of the building’s ground floor. Parking for 20 cars will be available on the site and a bike room will accommodate 98 bike parking spaces. Topping out at 94 feet tall, residents will have access to a rooftop amenity deck as part of the project’s strategy to offer more green space which also includes the open space in front of the building that houses a plaza and playlot for residents. The building will meet LEED Gold and include EV charging readiness in the parking lot. The developer is seeking a rezoning of the site from M1-1 to B2-3 with an overall Planned Development designation. With Chicago City Council approval, the $60 million development is fully approved, and the developer can proceed with securing financing and starting construction. ",Pilsen,1.0

Preliminary landmark approved for St. Adalbert Parish Complex,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark designation for the St. Adalbert Parish Complex in Pilsen. Occupying half of a city block, the church complex is bound by W. 16th St to the north, S. Paulina St to the west, and W. 17th St to the south.  Made up of the St. Adalbert Church, St. Adalbert Rectory, St. Adalbert Convent, and St. Adalbert School, the complex is set to meet Criterion 1 for heritage. Set in the Lower West Side, the church was located within an industrial hub in the city with work and infrastructure bringing Bohemian and Polish immigrants to the area in the mid-to-late-1800s. Founded in 1874, the St. Adalbert’s church was formed to give Polish immigrants in the area their own church after other Polish parishes opened in other areas of the city.  Designed by ecclesiastical architect Henry J Schlacks, the church began construction in 1912 and wrapped up in 1914. At its peak, the church has a congregation of 4,000 families and 2,000 school students. In the mid-20th century, the Polish population began to shrink as they moved out of the neighborhood and Mexican immigrants began moving in. By the 1970s, the congregation was down to 600 families and the Archdiocese announced the planned closure of the church. Community members and parishioners joined forces to protest the plan and successfully fended off the closure.  With the number of parishioners continuing to wane, the Archdiocese again announced the planned closure of the church in 2016 and the last mass was held on July 14th, 2019. With potential plans to sell the property to developers, the archdiocese recently began removing stained glass windows from the church, adding extreme urgency to the long sought landmark designation.  The proposed designation continues onto to list Criterion 4 as one of the criteria for designation, for the building’s exemplary architecture. Designed in the Renaissance Revival style, the church exhibits a distinctive south facade with two 185-foot-tall bell towers and exquisite ornamentation. Clad in cream-colored brick with granite, limestone, and terracotta details throughout, the remaining elevations, while clearly intended as secondary, continue the use of the cream-colored brick.  Built in conjunction with the church and also designed by Schlacks, the rectory exhibits a simplified Renaissance Revival style while also using the cream-colored brick with stone and terracotta detailing. Built in 1928 by architect Paul N. Duca, the convent is also a simple interpretation of Renaissance Revival architecture that blends harmoniously with the church and rectory. Built in 1908, St. Adalbert’s School is a three-story building that divulges from the rest by using red brick with yellow brick ornament. Limestone entryways anchor each end of the facade that features a series of symmetrical rows of windows. Meeting Criterion 5 for being the work of a significant architect, the church and rectory were designed by Henry J. Schlacks, a Chicago-born architect who became known as the specialist of Catholic churches. Schlacks began his career by studying at MIT and trained as a drafting apprentice under Adler and Sullivan.  The final criterion the church complex meets is Criterion 7. Spanning a half city block, St. Adalbert’s Church is a large-scale, Renaissance Revival church that towers 185 feet over a low-scale residential and commercial neighborhood. With its context remaining remarkably similar over the years, the church has been a prominent visual feature for over a century, The landmarks staff have also identified that the complex meets the separate Integrity Criterion. All four of the buildings remain in their original location and the character-defining exterior features, materials, and design are largely intact, converting their historical significance. The significant features of the complex are proposed to be all exterior elevations and rooflines of the church, rectory, convent, and school. The interior of all buildings and a small garage structure will be excluded from protection. Additional guidelines in the designation state that the Commission’s review of proposed work will ensure significant features are preserved while allowing reasonable changes and flexibility to meet the needs of future proposed uses of the structures or new construction on the undeveloped portions of the property. With preliminary landmark designation approved, landmarks staff will present a final report to the Commission before it votes on a final landmark recommendation to send the proposed designation to City Hall. A vote from the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council will be needed to officially designate the buildings as a Chicago landmark. ",Pilsen,0.0

Plan Commission approves 18th/Peoria development plan,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved and adopted the 18th and Peoria Development Framework Plan. Spanning 6.3 acres in Pilsen, the property is bounded by 16th St to the north, Newberry Ave to the east, 18th St to the south, and Sangamon St to the west. With the consultant team made up of AECOM, UrbanWorks, and KOO, the process to craft the development plan included an existing conditions report, preliminary sketch plans, numerous public and stakeholder meetings, and multiple revisions to the draft scenario. Split into phases, the development plan calls for a first phase of three 6-7 story mixed-use buildings along W. 18th St which would hold ground floor commercial space with apartments above. Moving north, the second phase would transition to a smaller scale with two 5-story mid-rise residential buildings. Moving further north, phase 3 would build townhomes, 6-flats and 3-flats to match the character of S. Newberry Ave. The final phase, located along the BNSF railway and W. 16th St, would include two 9-story residential buildings with interior parking on the first two floors. The plan calls for adding 2.5 acres of open space which will include a programmable open space, performance space, a playlot, and gathering space. Planned to connect to the Paseo trail, the planned central park will act as a gateway for the Paseo trail. A linear park is planned to run alongside S. Peoria St through the middle of the development.  Through the robust community process, the community identified the fact that they wanted a mix of housing types. The team increased the total unit count from 351 to 432, increased the density at the north and south ends, and minimized the vehicular connections all in response to community feedback. With the plan approved and adopted, next steps will include continued coordination with the Chicago Park District in regards to the future open space and with CDOT for the streetscape improvements and infrastructure needs. The plan is looking to potentially establish a Planned Development to also help govern the future build-out of the site.

Spanning 17,500 square feet, the retail space will stretch into the building mainly along the N. Milwaukee Ave frontage. The residential lobby will face W. Irving Park approximately where the construction skip is currently located.  While not specifically part of the tour, parking within the building will include 45 spaces on the ground floor to support the retail space, with an additional 108 on the second floor designated for the senior residents. Parking will be offered via a valet service as an amenity to seniors, so they don’t have to navigate through the garage. The next stop on the tour was the third floor. Poised as the main gathering space for residents, the developers envision tenants coming up from the street and getting off onto the third floor to engage with the building’s community. Coming off the elevator, there will be a concierge desk and there is a wide hallway to guide visitors and residents towards the lounge space that sits within the prow. Along the windows overlooking N. Milwaukee Ave will be the independent living dining room. Residents in independent living will have full kitchens in their units but can also come to the dining space to eat if they would like.  At the prow, there will be a large bar with seating for happy hours and gathering. In addition, the third-floor amenity space includes a large lounge with a fireplace, a private dining room, a theater room, and an arts studio. The next stop on the third floor was the assisted living dining room. This space will look out over the internal courtyard that will be planted with trees and greenery. A commercial kitchen is placed between the two separate dining spaces to serve both of them easily.  Walking up to the fourth floor, the next stop of the tour was an additional amenity space. A multipurpose space has been provided to offer flexibility in use for residents. The indoor space will overlook the outdoor terrace that sits on the prow, overlooking the Six Corners intersection.  The final stop was looking at some independent living units. As the most typical option for living, the independent living residences offer a full-size kitchen and up to two bedrooms. While they weren’t part of the tour, assisted living units will have a partial kitchen as those residents will need more help in everyday activities and will use the dining option more often. Memory care units will have no kitchen and there will be full-time staff care for those tenants. The $117 million development is rapidly nearing completion. With work very far along, the building is expected to open to new tenants in mid-fall of this year.  ",Portage Park,0.0
Six Corners Sears redevelopment clears key vote,"A proposal from developer Novak Construction to redevelop the former Portage Park Sears location into a mixed-use complex won the crucial support of the Chicago Plan Commission. The $90 million project would reuse the commercial structure at 4730 W. Irving Park Road in the Six Corners shopping district, which has sat vacant since closing in July 2018. In addition to repurposing the former department store, the plan would construct a five-story residential wing to the north. The existing building would be reclad with new patterns and window openings to evoke art deco architecture, and the ""lantern"" window on the corner would be rebuilt. The combined structures would be topped by a sixth-floor glass-enclosed amenity level as well as an outdoor pool. The development would deliver 50,000 square feet of commercial space, 207 rental units, and parking for 275 automobiles and 207 bicycles. Only six (2.5 percent of the total) units will be offered at an affordable rate. The developer will pay roughly $2 million into the city’s Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund to satisfy city requirements. Chicago Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox praised the development team for working with his department to increase the pedestrian orientation on all sides of the project. ""This will set the tone for what will happen on the adjacent parcels,"" said Cox. ""It could go either way: [the adjacent parcels] could become much more suburban and car-oriented or it could continue this pattern that is being set by the Sears [project]."" Novak aims to break ground on the Sears redevelopment next spring. Construction is expected to take roughly 18 months to complete. The project will rise just across the street from the recently topped-off 10-story Clarendale Six Corners senior housing development.  ",Portage Park,1.0
10-story senior living project tops off in Portage Park,"After breaking ground earlier this year, an upcoming senior living development is looming large over the Six Corners shopping district in Portage Park after recently reaching its final height of 10 stories. Dubbed the Clarendale Six Corners, the $117 million project at 4715 W. Irving Park Road is designed, developed, and built by the Ryan Companies and features 258 age-restricted residences. Unit breakdown in the highly amenitized building includes 114 independent living apartments, 98 assisted living residences, and 46 memory care units. Eleven of the residences will be set aside as on-site affordable housing. The facility is expected to welcome its first residents in fall 2022. The Clarendale is also part of a larger 4-acre development known as The Point that has been in discussion since a Bank of America branch at the site was torn down in 2015. The mixed-use complex will also feature retail space anchored by a new Aldi supermarket as well as off-street parking spaces for 215 motor vehicles.  Meanwhile, plans are in the works to bring more development to the Six Corners intersection. Developer-builder Novak Construction is seeking city approval to adapt the vacant Sears property at nearby 4730 W. Irving Park Road into a new mixed-use complex containing 207 apartments, retail, and 257 parking spaces. The proposal will go before the Chicago Plan Commission on August 19. ",Portage Park,1.0
New plan for Six Corners Sears site breaks cover,"On Thursday evening Novak Construction revealed its vision to redevelop the shuttered Sears store at Six Corners in Portage Park into a mixed-use complex with new retail space, parking, and rental units. The plan would breathe new life into the hulking commercial building which has sat vacant since closing in July 2018. Although a joint venture between Tucker Development and Seritage Growth Properties pitched a $200 million proposal to redevelop the store at 4730 W. Irving Park Road, that plan did not move forward. Novak purchased the property in September 2020. ""As many would agree, this site has the potential to play a role in helping to transform our community and give our local economy a boost that is long overdue,"" said Ald. James Gardiner (45th) at a virtual community meeting to discuss the plan. Gardiner noted that Six Corners was once the second busiest shopping district in Chicago, and that the shuttered art deco structure was one of a handful of stores that featured the ""iconic"" second-floor showcase window—an architectural feature the developers hope to retain. Novak's plan would demolish the 1970s-era addition on the east of the building and construct a five-story residential wing to the north and a sixth-floor glass-enclosed amenity area and an outdoor pool. The proposal would also reclad the exterior with a vertical pattern to evoke art deco architecture and rebuild the ""lantern"" section on the corner, which is no longer structurally sound according to the development team. Designed by architecture firm MG2, the proposed mixed-use complex will contain 208 apartments offered in studio, one-, and two-bedroom floorplans. Apartments on the fifth floor will boast 18-foot ceilings and some units will be lofted. Monthly rents are expected to be in the $2.75 to $3 per square foot range, and there will be six affordable-rate residences on-site. The plan includes 50,000 square feet of retail which will be divided into a 45,000-square-foot single-tenant space on the corner and a smaller 5,000-square-foot space fronting Cicero Avenue. There will be 183 parking spaces for residents located in the basement and on the second floor, and a ground-floor garage will contain 89 parking spaces for retail customers. The current plan does not include the former Sears Auto Center on the north side of Cuyler Avenue, but the developers did not rule out redeveloping that portion of the property as part of a future phase.  Novak will need to amend an existing Planned Development to build their proposal and hope to get the city's approval this fall and break ground next spring. Construction will take roughly 18 months. If approved the Sears redevelopment would join the 10-story Clarendale Six Corners senior housing project currently under construction across the street.

10-story senior living project goes vertical in Portage Park,"It's been less than a month since a big red construction crane appeared above the Six Corners shopping district on Chicago's northwest side. And during that time, the upcoming 10-story senior living development known as the Clarendale Six Corners has started to take shape. The $117 million project—which is designed, developed, and built by the Ryan Companies—is already poking up above the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue,  Irving Park Road, and Cicero Avenue. The new structure replaces an unsightly water-filled pit that sat at the corner for years after a Bank of America branch was torn down in 2015.  When complete, the Clarendale will deliver 258 age-restricted residences. The unit breakdown includes 114 independent living apartments designed, 98 assisted living residences, and 46 units reserved for memory care. Ald. Jim Gardiner (45th) temporarily held up zoning approvals for the project when he took office in 2019 and negotiated with the developer to add 11 affordable housing units. Gardiner told the Sun-Times in 2020 that he was ""most proud"" of getting affordable units to be built on-site when market-rate rents in the building range from $4,000 to $7,500 a month. ""This was a long time coming, and we're ready to be an important anchor in the redevelopment of this prominent intersection,"" said Dan Walsh, Ryan Companies' senior vice president of development, in a groundbreaking news release in January. ""This property will give our residents and employees access to a wide range of amenities right outside their doorstep, all while helping the Six Corners shopping district continue its resurgence as a critical destination for the northwest neighborhoods and powerful engine for the local economy."" The Clarendale is one piece of a larger 4-acre development known as The Point. The mixed-use complex features retail space anchored by a new Aldi supermarket as well as 215 off-street parking spaces. Streetscape improvements include a pair of plazas. There's also a mid-block pedestrian connection that will cut beneath the new building between Milwaukee Avenue and Irving Park Road. The Clarendale Six Corners will create approximately 650 union construction jobs and 200 permanent jobs over a 20-year period, according to its developers.  ",Portage Park,0.0

Long-awaited Pullman National Monument celebrates grand opening,"This weekend, Chicagoans will get their first opportunity to explore the new visitor center at Pullman National Monument on the city's far south side. The attraction opens within the restored Pullman Clock Tower and Administration building at 11001 S. Cottage Grove Avenue and serves as the focal point for the 12-acre monument campus. Designed in the late-Victorian style by Solon S. Beman, the clocktower was the architectural centerpiece of the community created in the 1880s by industrialist George Pullman to build his eponymous rail sleeper cars. Although envisioned as a master-planned utopia where employees would both live and work, the town was at the center of numerous labor and civil rights struggles including a bloody 1894 strike that brought the nation's railway system to its knees.  

 Preserving Pullman's history has been a decades-long grassroots struggle led by a coalition of preservationists, residents, and local stakeholders. The effort got a major boost in 2015 when President Barack Obama designated Pullman as Chicago's first and only National Monument. However, the Clock Tower building sustained heavy damage from an arsonist's fire in 1998 and required extensive repairs. ""We are thrilled to celebrate with our partners and visitors the grand opening of the visitor center, which was restored and renovated in part through the generosity of the National Park Foundation and its donors,” said Pullman National Monument Superintendent Teri Gage in a statement. ""As a partnership park, Pullman National Monument benefits from the thriving urban community we call home, including the many partners whose efforts over decades have made it possible to preserve and share this special place in Chicago and American history."" The new center features exhibits exploring Pullman's vision to create the country's first planned industrial community, how the Pullman Porters formed the first black labor union in the country, the aforementioned strike, and how the community came together to preserve the historic district. There's even a replica of a Pullman Palace Car Company sleeper. The monument's master developer is the Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives. The restoration of the Clock Tower and Administration building was overseen by architecture firm Bauer Latoza Studio and included ""new plumbing/fire protection, HVAC, telecom, and electrical systems, and exterior building repairs,"" according to general contractor GMA Construction Group. The visitor center is located on the building's ground floor. Work on the upper floors is ongoing.  Taking place on September 4 and 5, the Labor Day weekend grand opening celebration features guided tours of the visitor center, the nearby historic Hotel Florence, and three historic Pullman-built rail cars at the 111th Street Metra Station. The programs are free but will require tickets (offered on a first-come basis) to ensure manageable crowds for social distancing. Supporters of the monument hope the facility will be an economic driver for the Pullman community, which has seen encouraging signs of growth in recent years. This spring, developers cut the ribbon on the affordable Pullman ArtsSpace Lofts—the neighborhood's first new multifamily development in more than 60 years. ",Pullman,0.0
Chicago's first indoor track and field facility opens in Pullman,"In Pullman, James McHugh Construction and joint venture partner Bowa Construction have completed Chicago's first Olympic-grade indoor running track. Dubbed the Indoor Track & Field Center at Gately Park, the $53.67 million structure at 10201 S. Cottage Grove Avenue spans nearly 140,000 square feet. The Far South Side facility is home to the area's only hydraulically banked running oval which relies on movable cylinders to vary the angle of the turns. These banked sections of the track can lay flat to accommodate other uses including volleyball, basketball, and non-sporting events. ""This is only the 12th indoor hydraulically banked track of its kind in the U.S., so it was crucial to use the best trade partners to build the track system, which features a complicated series of jacks and pumps within pits at both ends of the track, and all supporting construction such as the super-flat concrete floors,"" said Andy Totten of McHugh Construction in a statement.  The new sports and recreation center was designed by Itasca, Illinois-based Williams Architects. The exterior is wrapped in an aluminum and glass curtainwall, brick-clad architectural precast concrete, traditional masonry veneer, and metal panels. To achieve a column-free layout, the structure's roof was constructed in six massive sections, each spanning 252 by 20 feet and weighing 120 tons. The Gately Indoor Track and Field complex also houses After School Matters programming designed by Eckenhoff Saunders. Amenities include a dance and exercise studio, a culinary teaching kitchen, gathering spaces, a rooftop deck and garden, and multipurpose labs for art, music, science, and technology. Participants and the public will also have access to new baseball fields at Gately Park. First announced back in 2014, the project faced early delays due to Illinois's ongoing budgetary crisis but ultimately secured funding through a combination of city, park district, and private sources—including gifts from Exelon Corporation, Mellody Hobson, and George Lucas. The facility broke ground in mid-2018. The new indoor track is an encouraging development within the greater Pullman community. The facility joins the recently completed Pullman ArtSpace Lofts, the neighborhood's first new multifamily development in more than 60 years.   ",Pullman,0.0
Affordable artist housing opens in Pullman Historic District,"Pullman's first new multifamily development in more than 60 years is officially complete. The developers behind the Pullman ArtsSpace Lofts recently held a ribbon-cutting event for the $18 million Far South Side project, although some residents moved into the building in early 2020. Located on Langley Avenue between 111th and 112th streets, the complex is home to 38 live-work rental units offered in studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom layouts. All apartments are reserved for renters earning 60 percent or below of the Area Median Income (AMI), and there is a 2,000-square-foot community space for hosting public events and art exhibitions. The project—which has been in discussion since 2011—comes from nonprofit developers Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, PullmanArts, and Minneapolis-based Artspace. The overall development includes a three-story new construction building designed by Stantec and a pair of 1880s-era structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The new masonry building rises between its historic neighbors and is designed to complement the Romanesque Rival architecture of the surrounding historic district. Pullman was founded in 1880 by railcar tycoon George Pullman and is considered the nation's first planned industrial community. Because the historic neighborhood is a U.S. Monument, the ArtSpace Lofts team had to work closely with the National Park Service and the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development. The development took advantage of Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits, Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and assistance from the Chicago Housing Authority.  ",Pullman,0.0

Four-story infill condo building ready to rise along Montrose,"A Chicago developer was awarded an estimated $7 million building permit to break ground on a four-story luxury condo building in Ravenswood Manor just ten months after plans for a taller, denser rental project were smacked down by the local alderperson. 2910 W Montrose LLC received the go-ahead to replace Paradise Spa & Sauna and an adjacent parking lot at the northeast corner of Montrose Avenue and Richmond Street with 18 for-sale residences and parking for 31 cars. The masonry building includes up to 6,700 square feet of ground-floor retail space, according to a recent marketing flyer for the property. SGW Architecture and Design is listed as the architect. The team had previously pitched a five-story rental building containing 59 apartments and 31 parking spaces at the site. That proposal died last October when Ald. Rossana Rodriguez (33rd) denied the project's requested zoning change from B3-2 to B2-3, citing overwhelming negative feedback from neighbors. ""The community does not feel that this development is a good fit for the neighborhood,"" the alderwoman wrote in her rejection letter. ""The development is too large, too dense, too expensive, does not provide enough two- and three-bedroom (family) units, and does not provide enough parking."" The developer behind the 2910 W. Montrose project, Alan Candea, came under further public scrutiny after his brother Armand Candea—also a real estate developer—published controversial Facebook posts including calls for Chicago to ""recruit snipers"" during last summer's episodes of looting and social unrest. Ald. Rodriguez called the post ""really concerning"" and factored it into her zoning decision, according to Block Club Chicago. The current redevelopment plan for the Ravenswood Manor property is scaled back to conform with existing zoning and therefore did not need the support of the local alderperson. The previous proposal called for six affordable-rate units, but the revised project isn't required to include any affordable housing because it did not seek a zoning change or other assistance from the city.

Salesforce Tower celebrates opening,"Salesforce has officially opened the doors of Salesforce Tower Chicago. Situated at the convergence of the north and south branches of the Chicago River, Salesforce Tower Chicago will serve as a beacon of Salesforce’s culture and our values, and a central gathering place for employees, customers, partners, and Trailblazers from around the world. The top two floors in the 57-story office building are dedicated ‘Ohana Floors, spaces for their employees and guests to enjoy during the day, and available for local nonprofits to host fundraising events at night and on weekends at no cost. To date, the company’s ‘Ohana Floors around the world have helped raise more than $108 million for local communities. For Salesforce Tower Chicago, the company has applied all they’ve learned post-pandemic to design spaces for how employees work today. When employees first came back to the office, it was primarily for collaboration, whether it be presentations, team off-sites, or brainstorms. Now that teams are coming in regularly, we’re also hearing that they need space for heads-down, focused work. Throughout the building, the design prioritizes flexibility and employee choice to ensure every individual and team can be successful. The employee floors have been designed to provide focus spaces, like libraries and focus pods, and areas for team collaboration and connection, like event spaces and communal kitchens. These zones are separated acoustically at opposite ends of the floor to support a neurodiverse population and offer more choices for employees. Throughout the workspaces are a mix of mindfulness rooms, pods of height-adjustable desks, and meeting and training rooms. The library spaces provide a variety of individual work settings, including natural light at some seats or, if employees choose, darker spaces with tactile surfaces and task lighting for user control. We’ve doubled the size of the social lounges on our employee floors to allow teams to transform these spaces for bespoke events and use them throughout the day as a working cafe. We’ve also added more conference and training rooms and flexible meeting space, equipped with the latest hybrid-work technology and room layouts to ensure our teams can connect with colleagues and customers around the world. As one of their most sustainable buildings to date, Salesforce Tower Chicago is on track to achieve LEED v4 Gold Certification for the exterior of the building, LEED v4 Platinum for the interiors, and Zero Carbon Certification. The building is also powered by all-electric systems, meaning there is no on-site use of fossil fuels. It is the first building in Chicago to require Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to quantify the embodied carbon emissions of concrete and steel, resulting in a 19% overall reduction in carbon emissions compared to the industry average.

Urbanize tours The Leo at 741 N. Wells ,"Urbanize recently toured progress on Vista Property’s The Leo, located at 741 N. Wells. Designed by Antonovich Associates, the 21-story mixed-use tower stands 255 feet tall, delivering 168 new apartments in addition to 9,400 square feet of retail space. The building will include 50 studios, 101 one-bedrooms and 17 two-bedrooms, as well as a rooftop terrace with pool, meeting facilities, exercise area, bicycle storage for 150 bikes and parking for 51 cars. With Skender Construction leading the construction for the project and our walkthrough, we began by heading up to the top of the building. Topping out at the 21st floor, the south side of the floor will provide residents with an expansive outdoor deck that features an outdoor pool with seating opportunities and fire pits. Inside, a cafe and lounge space faces northwest, with coworking spaces facing north.  Heading down one level, the 20th floor is the highest residential floor in the building. With higher ceilings, this level of units already has drywall done, flooring installed, and paint has started. A few floors down, cabinets are starting to go in on the 17th floor. With a two-tone design, cabinets have been installed on the sixth floor. Units on this floor are almost done, with finishes and paint already completed.  Stopping next on the fourth floor, the fitness amenity space occupies the northwest corner, with an outdoor fitness terrace overlooking the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Wells St to the north. Wrapping around the building, the rooftop of the podium will be covered in a green roof, with four-floor apartments getting large private terraces that face east. On the ground floor, the residential lobby is enclosed, and the facade features a V-shaped column feature. Inside, drywall has begun, and the lobby is awaiting completion. Totaling 9,400 square feet, two retail spaces flank the residential lobby which is centered in the street frontage. With work on the interior getting ever closer to completion, Skender will turn over the entire building to clients Vista Property Group at the end of January 2024 for residents to move in.

First state approvals secured for Medinah Temple temporary casino,"The Illinois Gaming Board has unanimously approved initial supplier licenses for Bally’s temporary casino at Medinah Temple. As part of their winning casino bid, Bally’s will be operating a temporary casino at Medinah Temple until the full-fledged casino is completed at the site of the current Tribune Freedom Center printing plant. With all city approvals set for the temporary casino and permit issued, the approvals from the Illinois Gaming Board are the final hurdle before the temporary space can open. According to reports from the Chicago Sun-Times, the board approved Medinah Building LLC, which represents the site’s physical structure, and Medinah Holdings LLC, which covers the land it sits on. Both controlled by Friedman Properties, the two entities would control and lease Medinah Temple to Bally’s.  The Illinois Gaming Board will need to sign off on more supplier licenses before the temporary casino could open. Once those licenses are approved, Bally’s hopes to begin construction and is targeting a Summer 2023 opening.  The permanent casino set for the Tribune publishing site has received all city approvals, but is awaiting review by the Illinois Gaming Board before construction could begin. Bally’s hopes to open the full-fledged site by 2026. ",River North,0.0
Urbanize tours progress at 741 N. Wells,"Urbanize recently toured progress on Vista Property’s latest development in Chicago at 741 N. Wells. Formerly occupied by a one-story retail building and three-story structure, the new tower will rise just off W. Chicago Ave, offset by a historic brick building that will be retained at 755 N. Wells.  Designed by Antunovich Associates, the 21-story mixed-use tower will rise 255 feet, delivering 168 new apartments in addition to 9,400 square feet of retail space. The building will include 50 studios, 101 one-bedrooms and 17 two-bedrooms, as well as a rooftop terrace with pool, meeting facilities, exercise area, bicycle storage for 150 bikes and parking for 51 cars. With Skender Construction leading the construction for the project and our walkthrough, we began by heading up to the top of the building. With the 19th floor slab poured just a couple days ahead, our tour began on the 18th floor where scaffolding is in place holding up the deck above. Looking out from the building, you can already see the expansive views that future residents will have. Nearby developments visible include JDL Development’s 920 N. Wells at North Union, North Wells Capital’s 311 W. Huron, Sterling Bay’s 360 N. Green in the distance, and Structured Development’s Big Deahl tower rising in the distance further north.  Heading down the building, a few of the floors right below 18 still have pole shores in place as the concrete decks fully cure. Our next stop was the 8th floor, where the facade is being installed. Designed as a window wall system, crews working further ahead install metal tracks on the concrete slabs for window pieces to clip into. Crews lift the individual window wall pieces into place, locking and sealing them as they go.  Working our way down, we stopped briefly on the sixth floor, where framing has been installed around the stairwells and workers have made more progress on installing mechanical systems. Stopping next on the fourth floor, we stepped out onto the roof deck. Residential units that face the fourth floor deck will each get their own private terrace.  Our next stop was the parking garage, which will have parking for 51 cars. The third floor includes space for a dog wash and dog run as a tenant amenity, while the second floor includes a bike room for 150 bikes. As an amenity-focused development, residents will also have access to meeting rooms, a fitness center, and a rooftop terrace with pool once the tower is completed.  Wrapping up the tour, we walked through the ground floor which will have 9,400 square feet of retail space flanking a center residential lobby. Currently, the construction hoist lands right where the entryway will be for residents.  With work progressing quickly, Skender expects to top out the tower later this month and enclose the entire building with glass by late Spring. Completion of the building is expected in January 2024. ",River North,0.0
Developer plans residential conversion at 153 W. Ohio,"Chicago developer Senco Properties is planning to convert the five-story brick commercial building at 153 W. Ohio into residential units. Located in River North the building sits midblock between N. LaSalle St and N. Wells St. The developer’s intentions were recently announced via Alderman Reilly’s newsletter to constituents.  With FitzGerald in charge of the architecture, the building will be infilled with 35 residential units. The newly renovated building will contain a mix of 5 studios, 11 one-beds, 6 one-bed pluses, 11 two-beds, and 2 three-beds. With zero parking in the building, residents will have access to 38 bike parking spaces in the basement.  While extensive interior work will be done, the exterior will see minimal changes to the exterior entryway and rooftop, with the building height remaining unchanged. The top floor units will be the only units to have balconies, while all residents will have access to a fitness center in the basement.  The ground floor will have the residential lobby and mailroom as well as two studios, a one-bed plus and a three-bed unit.  Since the building will not be expanded, the plan will comply with the existing DX-7 zoning. To allow for the residential use on the ground floor, the developer will need approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals. Due to the lack of parking, a variation will also be required to waive the parking requirement for the transit-served location. Approvals from the City Council will not be required. ",River North,0.0
Permits issued for Medinah Temple temporary casino,"Building permits have been issued for the temporary casino at Medinah Temple planned by Bally’s Corporation. As part of their winning casino bid, Bally’s will be operating a temporary casino at Medinah Temple until the full-fledged casino is completed at the site of the current Tribune Freedom Center printing plant. With STL Architects on board for the conversion, the plan will renovate the interior while avoiding any building changes to the landmarked exterior. Originally built in 1912 by architects Huel and Schmid, the building was home to the Chicago Shriners and was designed in a Moorish style with extensive ornament that makes it a unique building amongst its surrounding context. Protected by landmark designation, the exterior will remain unchanged with the exception of new signs replacing the old signs. The current signage from Bloomingdale’s will be removed and replaced with Bally’s signage that matches the same configuration and scale.   On the interior, Bloomingdale’s conversion in 2003 saw the filling in of the original 4,200-seat auditorium to create larger floor plates for the store. Since the proscenium was also protected by the landmark status, it was retained and painted white. With SOSH Architects working on the interior, the casino plan will see the removal of most of the interior partitions to open up the floors to casino gaming. Any new walls and rooms on the top floor would be built below the original ceiling to keep the coffered ceilings intact. With permits issued for the construction, general contractor Gilbane Building Company can begin work to finish by Bally’s target of a Summer 2023 opening. Once open, it is planned to run for 24 months until the full casino site is opened to the public. ",River North,0.0
741 N. Wells scores full building permit,"After recently breaking ground and scoring foundation permits, a full building permit has been issued for 741 N. Wells. Marking the final procedural hurdle before construction can proceed through completion, developer Vista Property is now fully approved to complete their new tower for the vacated site.  Formerly occupied by a one-story retail building and three-story structure, the new tower will stand just off W. Chicago Ave, offset by a historic brick building that will be retained at 755 N. Wells. With Antunovich Associates in charge of the design, the new mixed-use tower will stand 21 floors, holding 168 residential units and 9,400 square feet of retail space. Rising 255 feet, the apartment mix will consist of 50 studios, 101 one-beds, and 17 two-beds. 51 car parking spaces will be included on the second and third floors, with bike parking provided for 150 bikes. Designed with a contemporary loft vernacular, the building will use floor-to-ceiling glass with a small amount of metal paneling. The front facade will have a subtle serrated edge stepping back from the street to allow for wider southern views. To offer relief on the ground floor for outdoor dining, the retail space will setback in line with the building’s setback.  Tenant amenities will include an interior dog run and dog spa, a fitness center, outdoor fitness space, a club room, coworking space, and an outdoor deck with a pool. The existing building at 755 N. Wells will be retained and used for retail and office space. To meet affordability requirements, the project will include five units on site at 60% AMI and a payment of $2.4 million in lieu of the remaining 13 units. VISTA Property financed the project with a first mortgage loan from Huntington Bank, and has also engaged Luxury Living Chicago Realty, downtown Chicago’s premier marketing, consulting and residential leasing brokerage firm. With Skender in charge of construction, completion is slated for 2024.   ",River North,1.0
VISTA Property breaks ground on 741 N. Wells,"VISTA Property broke ground yesterday on 741 N. Wells, a new mixed-use multifamily rental building in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. Designed by Antunovich Associates, the 21-story, 201,000-square-foot development will include 168 apartment units, 9,400 square feet of retail space, communal tenant amenities and an elegant building lobby.

Landmarks approves Medinah Temple temporary casino,"The Permit Review Committee from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved plans for the temporary casino at Medinah Temple planned by Bally’s Corporation.

Any new walls and rooms on the top floor would be built below the ceiling to keep the coffered ceilings intact. The architects will follow a similar lighting plan from Bloomingdale’s to achieve a low visual impact and embrace the geometry of the original ceiling coffers. While operating as a casino, the main entry will be at the center of the building along N. Wabash Ave. Pedestrian exits will be located at the corners along W. Ohio St and W. Ontario St, with an employee entrance on W. Ohio St. A service and loading access point will be along W. Ontario St. Originally the temporary casino was planned for the waterfront parcel at the northeastern corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St across from the final casino location. The switch to Medinah Temple was made because the current W. Chicago Ave bridge and intersection at W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St are planned to be reconstructed in 2023. This work would cause massive issues for traffic access and would at times fully cut off access to that site. With approval from the Permit Review Committee, the architects will be working on the construction documents and submitting for permits early this fall with construction planned to begin after permits are obtained. Bally’s goal is to open the temporary site early in Summer 2023 and it will run for 24 months, with a 12-month extension possible if needed before the full casino site is opened to the public.

Photos: Urbanize tours the nearly complete One Chicago development,"The expansive One Chicago development is nearly complete and Urbanize got an inside look at the construction. Planned to deliver 735 rental apartments and 77 for-sale condominiums, the two-tower plan is a venture of JDL Development. Located in the heart of River North, the design is a product of collaboration between Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture and Goettsch Partners. Since Urbanize’s last tour, the tower crane is down, glass is up, and the construction hoist has been removed. The tour began along W. Superior St at the building’s motor court, designed for resident loading, pickup, and drop off, as well as parking access.  Loading up in the service elevator, we headed up to the penthouse condominium, a duplex on the 74th and 75th floors. While the entire building has been encased in glass, interior work on the penthouse won’t be completed until it is sold. Interior MEP layouts will be roughed in, with the remaining interior finishes left up to the eventual buyer.  The vistas from the penthouse feature unobstructed views in every direction, with an impressive sight of the John Hancock Tower, now known as 875 N. Michigan. The large exterior terrace sits atop one of the final setbacks facing north. The next stop was the model condominium unit on the 46th floor. Located within the top floors of the 76-story, 971-foot main tower, the 77 condominiums are spread across the levels in quarter-floor units, half-floor homes, and full-floor configurations. The homes are expected to begin closings at the end of April. On the lower floors of the main tower sits the One Chicago Apartments. As the next stop on the tour, Urbanize walked through a three-bedroom rental on the 42nd floor, as well as a one-bedroom rental and two-bedroom unit on the 24th floor. The rentals are currently pre-leasing and expect the first move-ins in mid-March. The next stop of the tour included a walkthrough of model units at 23 West Chicago, the shorter 49-story, 574-foot tower. Dubbed 23 West Apartments, the collection of rental units began move-ins back in October 2021 and offer a range of unit sizes and products. Our tour took us through a one-bedroom apartment and a two-bedroom rental on the 27th floor. Some of these units are offered to tenants as guest suites, available on a nightly basis for family or friends visiting residents of the building. While not part of the tour, the building’s podium is home to a large Whole Foods that is nearing completion. Encompassing multiple floors, the southwestern end of the podium holds a massive Lifetime Fitness Club, offering an outdoor pool deck, indoor/outdoor pool, full-sized NCAA basketball court, and flexible gym space. The podium will also include a Phil’s Coffee at the base of the 23 W. Chicago tower. Restaurant tenants for commercial space along N. State Street will soon be announced. With construction led by Power Construction, the expansive complex is wrapping up work, with all residential products set to be available for lease or closing by the end of April. The Lifetime Fitness Club has been open since the beginning of the New Year and Whole Foods is anticipated to open around March.  ",River North,0.0
Boutique condo building switches back to hotel at 61 W. Erie,"As construction wraps up at 61 W. Erie St, news has broken that the building will be converted into a boutique hotel. Announced via Alderman Reilly’s recent newsletter to constituents, Sonder Hospitality is planning on operating the project as a boutique hotel. The development is currently being managed and constructed by LG Development.  The site has been the subject of a long saga of proposals and scope changes. A 12-story condo building was originally proposed by LG Development in 2017 but failed to get started. In 2019, the developers planned to collaborate with Sonder Hospitality and build a five-story hotel concept with short-term rental suites. In 2020, Sonder backed out due to the coronavirus pandemic upending the hospitality industry and LG Development moved ahead with the units planned as for-sale condos.  With a strong recovery in the hospitality industry, Sonder is reportedly excited to again pursue this location as a boutique hotel. The 28 condos will be now converted into 28 apartment style hotel suites, with ground floor retail remaining unchanged. Sonder will have full time employees and on-site security.  Since the building was constructed under the existing zoning of DX-5, hotel use is permitted as-of right, and no approvals will be necessary for the switch. An official opening date has not been announced. ",River North,0.0
Details emerge for mixed-use development at 700 W. Chicago,"Details have emerged for the mixed-use development planned at 700 W. Chicago. Dubbed Halsted Landing, the development proposed by Onni Group was presented to the River Ecology and Governance Task Force’s Development Review Working Group.  With the zoning application filed at the end of July, the project site is located at the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St along the Chicago River, just across the street from Bally’s Casino and across the river from Onni Group’s Halsted Point which recently gained approval for its Phase 1 tower. The site was also previously conceived as a multi-phase office development that was canceled in the aftermath of COVID. Designed by Goettsch Partners, the multi-phase development will see the construction of four new mixed-use skyscrapers. Set to total 2,451 residential units, the project will support the housing with ground-floor retail space, 1,950 parking spaces located underground, 2,451 bike parking spaces and extensive exterior landscaping along the Chicago River.  Split into three subareas, the first subarea will be located along N. Halsted St up against the river. Planned to be the first phase of the overall project, the mixed-use tower will have a four-story podium topped by an 11-story midrise portion and a 56-story point tower. Reaching 600 feet tall, the tower will have 540 residential units in the tower itself and 148 podium and liner units. The ground floor will include 9,800 square feet of retail space alongside the residential lobby that will both face south onto a new access road through the site. The second subarea and phase of the proposal, located at the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St will include a 500-foot-tall, 44-story skyscraper. The building will have 382 residential units in the tower and 160 podium and liner units. With retail wrapping around the entire ground floor, there will be a total of 33,300 square feet of retail space. The residential lobby will face east towards a newly extended N. Jefferson St. This second phase will also add a 9-story commercial midrise along N. Halsted St. Adjacent to the first phase of the development, the building will front N. Halsted St with 3,800 square feet of retail space and the residential lobby will face south towards the new access drive. The third subarea, planned along W. Chicago Ave at the river, will have two towers linked by a four-story podium. Rising 51-story, the west skyscraper will stand 550 feet tall and feature 540 residential units in the tower and 45 podium and liner units. Rising 650 feet in height, the eastern skyscraper will stand 57 stories with 606 residential units in the tower and 30 podium or liner units. Between the two towers, the podium will include 8,400 square feet of retail space. With Confluence serving as the landscape architect, the riverfront has been designed with a riverwalk that will connect to future extensions in an area that has been cut off from the Chicago River by industry for over a century. The proposed design reestablishes that connection with multiple pathways from street to river, linkages to adjacent riverwalk segments, and programming that celebrates the beauty and energy of the river.  The site has a grade change of about 30 feet from street to waterfront which poses significant challenges for access. The design creates a series of distinct experiences including vibrant urban streetscape, elevated belvedere terraces, tiered step and planting zones, an inviting waterfront, and a dramatic pedestrian bridge across the river.  The riverwalk will feature a water taxi stop, drink rail with stool seating, shared riverwalk area, terraced seating, overlook deck with shade structure, riverwalk restaurant seating, overlook stage platform with canopy, amphitheater, retail spaces, native riparian planting trail, playground with climbing wall, potential floating wetland area, riverwalk bike parking, and a restaurant overlook terrace. The presentation to the River Ecology and Governance Task Force’s Development Review Working Group comes amid DPD’s internal review of the development. While a timeline for the approval process is currently unclear, the project is set to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council. ",River West,1.0
Illinois Gaming Board grants Bally’s permanent casino license,"The Illinois Gaming Board has approved Bally’s permanent owners license as the final step of review before Bally’s Corporation can begin construction and operate the $1.7 billion permanent casino redevelopment in River West.  As the first urban casino, the entertainment complex will include the casino space with 3,400 slots and 173 table games, 10 food and beverage venues, a 3,000-seat theater and event space, a 20,000 square foot exhibition and museum venue, and a 500-key hotel tower at the north end of the site. The complex’s interior spaces will be complemented with more than 10 acres of outdoor space that include a park for the community with various outdoor programming planned for the site. The project’s ownership team includes Bally’s Corporation and minority-ownership Community Investment Programs. Architects Solomon Cordwell Buenz are leading the masterplan in collaboration with V3 Companies, Gensler, and Site Design Group. Gensler has taken over the architecture of the entire complex, except for the hotel tower which Solomon Cordwell Buenz will be the architect for. Site Design Group will be the landscape architect, SOSH Architects will lead the casino’s interior design, STL Architects will lead the theater interior design, and local firms UrbanWorks and Nia Architects are working as associated architects.  The Illinois Gaming Board also approved an extension of Bally’s temporary operating license at Medinah Temple for a maximum of three years, allowing the facility to remain open until September 9th, 2026. According to Alderman Reilly’s office, they confirmed that Bally’s lease at Medinah Temple expires in 2026 and no extensions would be allowed by the landlord or the IGB. Bally’s temporary casino at Medinah Temple officially opened back on September 9th and will be open 8:00am - 5:00 am seven days a week, with plans to extend hours to a full 24 hours. The temporary casino will offer patrons 750 slot machines, 55 table games, two restaurants, and a cafe.   With approvals in line for Bally's permanent casino, construction is expected to begin after July 2024 when they take over the site of the Chicago Tribune printing plant. This timeline will give them just about two years to construct the permanent facility before their operating license expires at Medinah Temple in September 2026. ",River West,0.0
Onni Group plans multiple towers at 700 W. Chicago,"A zoning application has been filed by Canadian developer Onni Group for the property located at 700 W. Chicago. Located at the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St along the Chicago River, the proposal would be just across the street from Bally’s Casino and across the river from Onni Group’s Halsted Point which recently gained approval for its Phase 1 tower. The site was also previously conceived as a multi-phase office development that was canceled in the aftermath of COVID. Designed by Goettsch Partners, the multi-phase development will see the construction of four new mixed-use skyscrapers. Set to total 2,451 residential units, the project will support the housing with ground-floor retail space, 1,950 parking spaces, 2,451 bike parking spaces and extensive exterior landscaping along the Chicago River.  Split into three subareas, the first subarea will include 688 residential units and be located along N. Halsted St up against the river. Planned to be the first phase of the overall project, the mixed-use tower will have a four-story podium topped by an 11-story midrise portion and a 56-story point tower. Reaching 600 feet tall, the square tower volume will be clad in a window wall system with outdoor balconies running up the facade.   At the base of the building, the building will be setback from N. Halsted St with a multi-use lawn designed to accommodate pop-up events. With an access drive coming off of N. Halsted St, the ground floor will have retail space facing the multi-use lawn to the west and the access drive to the south. Parking access will come from the service drive and connect to the parking behind the retail space and go up into the podium. The space on the ground floor under the main tower will have the residential lobby as well as more retail space that will face east.  The second subarea of the proposal, located at the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St will include a 500-foot-tall, 44-story skyscraper that will have 542 units. The third subarea, planned along W. Chicago Ave at the river, will have a 51-story skyscraper and 57-story skyscraper linked by a four-story podium. Topping out at 650 feet, the two towers will have a combined 1,221 apartments.  The overall master plan includes a large green space along the river which will include a walking path, assorted seating opportunities, an amphitheater with an overlook platform, and native plantings all around. The walkway is expected to go under the Chicago Ave bridge to link to the casino riverwalk. With the zoning application submitted, Onni Group is looking to amend the existing Planned Development with a base FAR of 5.0 and a 3.1 FAR bonus. The developers plan to satisfy the 20% affordability requirement with 490 affordable units across the four towers. To move forward with the project, the developer will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council.   ",River West,1.0
City approves updated design for Bally’s Casino,"Bally’s Casino has received site plan approval from the Chicago Department of Planning and Development. Announced yesterday by Bally’s Corporation, the approval solidifies the plan for the $1.7 billion development to begin construction in late 2024. As the first urban casino, the entertainment complex will include the casino space with 3,400 slots and 173 table games, 10 food and beverage venues, a 3,000-seat theater and event space, a 20,000 square foot exhibition and museum venue, and a 500-key hotel tower at the north end of the site. The complex’s interior spaces will be complemented with more than 10 acres of outdoor space that include a park for the community with various outdoor programming planned for the site. As part of Bally’s progress on the project, the development team has been outlined in detail. Bally’s Corporation and minority-ownership Community Investment Programs make up the ownership team. Architects Solomon Cordwell Buenz are leading the masterplan in collaboration with V3 Companies, Gensler, and Site Design Group. Gensler has taken over the architecture of the entire complex, except for the hotel tower which Solomon Cordwell Buenz will be the architect for. Site Design Group will be the landscape architect, SOSH Architects will lead the casino’s interior design, STL Architects will lead the theater interior design, and local firms UrbanWorks and Nia Architects are working as associated architects.  For engineering, V3 Companies will be leading civil engineering and site infrastructure, Magnusson Klemencic Associates and Milhouse Engineering will be the structural engineers, and MEP engineering will be done by Environmental Systems Design and Milhouse Engineering. The owner’s project development advisors include DMA, Rider Levett Bucknall, and BRG Consulting Ltd. Chicago Community Builders Collective will be the project’s general contractor. With site plan approval secured, Bally's Chicago has the city approval to begin construction as planned late in 2024. Prior to opening gaming operations, they must meet Illinois Gaming Board regulatory and statutory requirements. ",River West,0.0
City Council approves rezoning for Bally’s Casino,"The Chicago City Council has approved the rezoning for Bally’s Casino at 777 W. Chicago. Sited along the Chicago River, the casino will replace the existing Chicago Tribune printing facility, reaching W. Chicago Ave to the north, W. Grand Ave to the south, and N. Halsted St to the west. As part of a revised River District masterplan, the casino will eventually be joined by a collection of mixed-use towers on the larger site. Set to transform the current industrial facility, the plan calls for Phase 1 to build the casino and associated uses to create a vibrant entertainment district. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the first phase will be anchored by a 500-foot-tall hotel tower at the north end of the site, standing 33-stories high with 500 hotel keys and a rooftop restaurant. Holding 4,000 gaming positions and more than 10 food and beverage offerings, the casino will occupy a large swath of land along the riverfront south of the hotel tower and bookended to the south by a 3,000-seat theater and event center. A 23,000 square-foot museum will be included in the building along the riverwalk. After extensive conversations about parking, Bally’s has removed the above-ground parking structure along W. Chicago Ave and has opted for another level of parking below the casino floor, totaling 2,500 spaces. A further 700 spaces will be built on surface lots occupying the future sites of the proposed mixed-use towers and will be temporary. These temporary spots will allow the city and Bally’s to monitor parking needs. If those extra 700 spots do indeed prove to be necessary, the future phases will be amended to include that extra parking as permanent.  Considering roadway access, the development would see the construction of N. Jefferson St as the main north/south arterial with new extensions of W. Huron St, W. Ancona St, W. Erie St, and N. Desplaines St. For vehicular access to the casino, regional traffic will be directed into the parking garages from W. Grand Ave up on N. Jefferson St where they will enter the underground parking garage before they would get to the new intersection with W. Erie St. Local traffic may enter from any direction with a second, smaller entry to parking garages accessible from N. Jefferson St at the north side of the casino. Loading and delivery trucks will be ushered to a separate loading dock area by entering from W. Grand Ave and using a service drive that keeps them at a below-grade level. With Site Design Group on board for the landscape design, the overall site has been adorned with extensive green space and parks, increasing the overall public open space from the originally approved Planned Development. At the north end of the site, a large drop-off and valet will be the main entry point to the casino and hotel, with lush landscaping added to give as much space back to people and beautify this northern entry to the site. With a newly constructed Jefferson St as the main corridor, the streetscape has been designed to be pedestrian friendly, with crosswalk bump-outs, extra street trees as possible and active connections to the riverwalk.  The main landscape feature for Phase 1 will be the Riverfront Park, south of the event center. This sloped park will create an experience of direct steps down to the riverwalk and sloped walkways that meander through the green space. Open lawns, a dog park, and other programmed spaces will be incorporated into the park while allowing for as much lush greenery as possible. The park will also connect the riverwalk which will offer a long walkway between W. Chicago Ave and W. Grand Ave, offering a mix of hardscape and softscape elements that work to enliven the water's edge for visitors. A water taxi stop and floating wetlands will be incorporated to allow for public access to the water. The future phases of the overall Planned Development will likely involve separate developers but is currently planned for a remainder 5.6 million square feet of mixed-use buildings. 4,799 units of housing, 300 hotel keys, and 125,000 square feet of retail would be allowed. A linear park running along N. Jefferson St will add more public green space with a dedicated bike lane. A new transitway along the Union Pacific alignment has been envisioned to pass through the site as well.  With full City Council approval both of the city’s casino agreement and the rezoning for its construction, Bally’s is left with only one more hurdle - the Illinois Gaming Commission. If approved by the state commission, construction could proceed on the permanent casino. Completion of the casino, hotel tower, riverwalk, and riverfront park is targeted for 2026.  ",River West,0.0

City Council approves NOMA,"The Chicago City Council has approved NOMA, a multi-phased development planned for a collection of sites all generally bound by N. Desplaines St, W. Hubbard St., N. Halsted St, and W. Ohio St. Originally revealed by Urbanize back in June, the multi-tower development surrounding the former Salvation Army building is being developed by Shapack Partners, with Alec and Jennifer Litowitz as capital partners. With New York-based ODA working on the project, the design calls for four new towers that will join the Salvation Army building. While not currently designed, the towers have been conceptualized to enhance and contribute to the public realm at street level. In response to Committee on Design and DPD feedback, the amount of open public space has been increased with more open-air plazas, reducing the amount of covered areas. At the northern site, a covered public plaza will anchor and activate the corner of N. Desplaines St and W. Grand Ave. Heading west on W. Grand Ave, the public realm around the Salvation Army building will be updated and improved for the new hotel planned for the building. Moving south down N. Union Ave, the northern portion of Parcel C will now be allocated as a triangular outdoor plaza with public art planned for the rail embankment. Looking west, a midblock crosswalk will connect pedestrians to the next public space, which will be a covered portion of Mews. Along N. Milwaukee Ave the covered Mews will turn into open air space within Parcel B. At the southwest end, the final property will have a corner plaza that opens up to the intersection of W. Hubbard St and N. Milwaukee Ave. Rising above the public realm, the sites will become home to four new towers. Subarea B in the northern Planned Development will see an approximately 625-foot-tall tower that will include office space, roughly 700 rental units, and ground floor retail space. The southern Planned Development will see a combined total of approximately 800 new rental units, with a 500-foot tower slated for Subarea C, a 400-foot tower planned for Subarea B, and a 350-foot tower anticipated for Subarea A. Each building will meet the ground with active retail spaces and residential lobbies. The first phase of the project will adaptively reuse the Salvation Army building at 509 N. Union, turning it into a boutique hotel. Dating back to 1891, the building stands six stories tall and was originally a margarine factory. With one half of the building made of timber framing and the other half a concrete vault structure, architects Eckenhoff Saunders Architects have designed a two-story addition for the southern portion of the building.  Rising 111 feet, the 30,000 square foot addition will be setback 10 feet from the front facade on its first floor and another 10 feet on the second floor. Providing 141 hotel rooms, the addition will also allow for a new amenity deck for hotel guests. On the ground floor, a restaurant space has been added that will include space inside a one-story building on the north side that is from the 1960s. The iconic water tower on top of the building will be retained as part of the project. With the overall development expected to build out exclusively rental units, the project will incorporate 20% affordability on-site. Between both Planned Developments, an almost $15 million Neighborhood Opportunity Fund payment is also expected. With approval from the City Council, work can proceed on the conversion of the Salvation Army as the first phase. Shapack Partners will need to secure funding before construction can start and future towers will be subject to site plan approval by DPD and CDOT.  ",River West,0.0

CoD reviews Bally’s casino plan,"The Committee on Design has reviewed Bally’s plan for its upcoming casino at 777 W. Chicago. Sited along the Chicago River, the casino will replace the existing Chicago Tribune printing facility, reaching W. Chicago Ave to the north, W. Grand Ave to the south, and N. Halsted St to the west. As part of a revised River District masterplan, the casino will eventually be joined by a collection of mixed-use towers on the larger site.  Over the course of two hours, the committee spent more than an hour on their discussion after hearing a long-winded presentation on the multi-faceted, complex project. To approach our reporting with “relative” brevity, we will look at the project through the lens of the lengthy, exhaustive discussion that touched every inch of the proposal and turned it inside out.   The discussion opened with questions from Leon Walker regarding the traffic plan. With Bally’s expecting about 3,000 cars to visit the site, their regional access plan calls for cars to exit the Kennedy Expressway using the Ohio Street feeder, turn right onto N. Orleans St, right again onto W. Grand Ave, and then onto the site from the south end. With only one lane of southbound traffic on N. Orleans St, Walker was concerned about congestion at that point. While they are working on an ongoing traffic study, this regional route is planned to avoid a high volume of cars on W. Chicago Ave and N. Halsted St in response to intense community pushback. Renauld Mitchell pushed back on Bally’s and questioned whether remote parking could be considered to relieve the direct impact on the immediate vicinity. The representative from Bally’s said there is quite a lot of work going into determining the parking count, with their analysis seeing the casino as a regional site where many will commute to the casino, in turn requiring higher parking counts. Members of the committee challenged the notion of an increased need for cars, considering Chicago’s strong access to transit and the actual reality of the multi-modal nature of the area, considering access by pedestrians, bicycles, public transit, and rideshare.  With SCB leading a larger group of architects and consultants on the design, the casino project will include a 500-foot-tall hotel tower at the north along W. Chicago Ave, a 3,000-seat theater further to the south, with the large casino building in between. Stretching multiple city blocks, the building will ultimately be enclosed with no windows along a newly constructed N. Jefferson St for almost 1000 feet.  Referencing the long, blank facade, committee members questioned the quality of the pedestrian experience along the new N. Jefferson St. According to the design team, regulations require the casino to be a contained space with a limited number of secured access points. Due to the nature of the site and adjacent railroad tracks from Union Pacific, the casino volume had to stretch and get longer to achieve the necessary size.  Jeanne Gang challenged the idea of the large casino floor plate and discussed how when a building typology is added into an urban setting, they need to transform. Gang suggested that they should think in section, potentially lifting the gaming floor one level above the street, freeing up the pedestrian realm for outward-facing retail and commercial spaces with flexibility of access to the river. More parking could be accommodated into the new street level behind the commercial space, reducing the need for the added parking structure that is planned to the west of the casino. The design team responded that they could look into, but the commercial space to line the parking that Gang mentioned is not currently part of the project’s program. Brian Lee turned his focus to Bally’s, citing the fact that often clients restrict what architects can do with the design. Lee noted that the casino has been very contentious, and no neighborhood wants it, yet Bally’s has a prime riverfront site for the project. Lee challenged Bally’s with this as an opportunity for them to define what an urban casino can be and lead the way in terms of how it fits into the neighborhood. If done well, the new casino typology could create value not only for this phase, but also for the subsequent phases of development around the casino. Lee felt that the fundamental problem is the size of the single casino floor plate that is currently the design and urged Bally’s to think stronger and more creatively to reduce the footprint of the casino and create better connections through the site. As designed, pedestrians and the public will be able to access the riverfront at the north end of the site from W. Chicago Ave and from a riverfront park south of the theater. A through connection between the casino and the theater also connects down to a museum at river level. Some restaurants that occupy multiple levels will reach down to the riverfront, activating that space along the water. A consideration brought up would be to, rather than orient all the outward facing program towards the water, reverse that and allow the river to be a seen, calm avenue and face the restaurants out towards N. Jefferson St to create a more vibrant pedestrian experience.  Reed Kroloff described the landscape plan as a string of pearls along the long stretch of frontage. Kroloff compared this approach to a suburban strip mall where everything is spread out and offered a different approach of clustering program to create moments of energy and activity along the river. The team responded that they pulled the program apart to try and activate the very long facade of the casino, but they have more work to do to finalize how that is executed. At the corner of W. Chicago Ave and N. Jefferson St, a public plaza would serve as a drop off and public connection into the site. Currently, the plaza would need to accommodate a grade change of about 8 feet up from the street. According to the project team, they are in conversation with the city as they reconstruct the Chicago Ave bridge and are looking into raising the height of the street to reduce the grade change from the street to the building.  Maria Villalobos chimed in to say that this plaza is not a true public space, seeing that the multiple purposes are there but it wouldn’t be a spot for the public to visit and spend time. Villalobos commented on how it is hard to get to the river and the current design makes it hidden from the public realm, asking whether the tower could be moved to give way to a bigger public space. The team responded that the location of the tower is flexible and could be rotated or moved to respond to the comments about the public space. The team worked with DPD to place the tower as is shown, creating a gateway in relation to W. Chicago Ave and the planned development at the newly acquired site by Onni Group across the street.  Jeanne Gang commented that she likes the tower but wonders about the large parking structure across N. Jefferson St, as that becomes part of the gateway at the north end of the site as well. Rather than spending money on an expensive building to satisfy parking needs, Gang suggested that they relocate the parking into the casino volume with the aforementioned raised concept, freeing up that site for another luxury tower that can aid in the financials of the overall plan. According to Bally’s, they studied moving parking underground, but it became cost prohibitive which led to the current scheme of the above ground structure.  As the committee received hesitation from the project team, they defended their position and asked the project team to at least consider their comments rather than offer straight rejection. The representative from Bally’s assured them that the feedback is expected and welcomed as they work through the process. They have not taken lightly the context of the casino and the design team will attest to how much the design has gone through the wringer. The Bally’s representative said they have tried everything possible to integrate the casino and make it successful while ensuring practicality in the design. With contractual obligations to the city, Bally’s must ensure the economic success of the project and the current design is the best solution they have been able to come up with. At this point, redesigning the project is not feasible.  Leon Walker jumped back in to say that this discussion is of ideas and not all of them have to be incorporated. The committee is providing feedback and ideas for the project team to take and see what works while moving forward. Casey Jones responded to the adversity by saying that the committee is trying to lend their expertise to deliver a stronger project. Bally’s signed up to an RFP to meet the city’s challenge and they are trying to help Bally’s meet the challenge and they are aware of the complexities and issues that come along with the scale of development. Bally’s assured that they are reading between the lines to see how much could be incorporated while keeping the overall project practical. After hearing the flexibility on the tower, Reed Kroloff chimed in to ask Bally’s if it is true that they can move the tower around but are not willing to shift any other parts. As the representative from Bally’s hesitated, Kroloff asked if they’re set on the L-shaped building that is roughly 1,000 feet long. The Bally’s rep said it is not a simple yes or no answer but due to the constraints of the site it would be hard to alter the footprint. After a contentious two hours, the meeting adjourned with no steadfast answers on the future of the design. Since the Committee on Design is an advisory group, Bally’s is not legally bound to adhere to their comments but will need to answer to any takeaways DPD incorporates into the progression of the city approval process. While the project is far from typical, the plan will need to follow the typical procedural approvals needed by any Planned Development in the city. Further discussion and changes are expected before the proposal goes before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning and City Council. Work is projected to begin early next year and open in 2026. ",River West,0.0
Committee on Design reviews NOMA,"Originally revealed by Urbanize last month, the multi-tower development surrounding the former Salvation Army building, now dubbed NOMA, has been reviewed by the Committee on Design. The mixed-use project will occupy a collection of sites all generally bound by N. Desplaines St, W. Hubbard St., N. Halsted St, and W. Ohio St. The project will convert the Salvation Army building into a new hotel and build an approximate 1,500 units of housing across four buildings paired with extensive retail and food/beverage space. Conceived by Shapack Partners, NOMA is the anchoring development within a new branded neighborhood that sits between Fulton Market and the River District with the future casino. A high importance is placed on the public realm, with extensive plans for the pedestrian experience and the shaping of the ground floor programming to activate the district. With Eckenhoff Saunders Architects tapped for the conversion of the Salvation Army building, the six-story structure will be converted into 141 hotel rooms. The primary facades will be preserved, with a small two-story addition added to the southern half of the building. Clad in contemporary metal, the addition will allow for destination dining and hotel amenities. Once revitalized, the building will be able to anchor and contribute substantially to the new district.  For the new construction, New York-based ODA has been brought on board to begin conceptualizing the project. The organization of the new towers step down from the tallest tower by the W. Ohio St ramp at Parcel G to Parcel A, the shortest tower, near the intersection of W. Grand Ave, N. Halsted St, and N. Milwaukee Ave.  First designing Parcel G, Eran Chen of ODA waked through three concept massings that the firm has developed. The first looks to build a tall, slender tower that steps back away from W. Grand Ave to create a vertical anchor along W. Ohio St. This initial massing creates a nice tower portion but results in a heavy base. The second massing splits the volume into two shorter towers on top of a podium, reducing height and creating a gateway view to the Salvation Army building. This iteration creates a more significant wall at the lower levels with such a large podium.  The third volume is very similar to the first concept, however it uses an L-shape that shifts as it rises, creating setbacks on one leg and cantilevers on the other leg. This version creates an elegant structure with a very dynamic form viewed at all angles. The strong form for this option can be appreciated from far away and can become the anchor for the neighborhood.  At the pedestrian scale, the urban plan calls for extending the public realm across the sites and through the streets. Connecting the sites, an art walk and park would be envisioned for W. Hubbard St in collaboration with the city. An art walk within the development will begin at the Salvation Army Building and continue down N. Union Ave to connect to the southern sites which will use the Mews concept from Shapack Partners’ previous projects at 167 N. Green and 170 N. Green to lace the sites together and create an active pedestrian experience. The meandering spaces will offer food and beverage options as well as retail spaces. A grand cultural institution, placed at W. Grand Ave and N. Desplaines St will connect the development and create a cultural anchor for the project that will enliven the entire community.  The discussion began with Ann Thompson who appreciated the emphasis on adaptive reuse and the preservation of the Salvation Army building. Thompson posed the question of whether the project team had considered contributing public green space to the project. The development team responded that green space would be a part of the Mews’ and plazas and could be integrated through the linear park along W. Hubbard St. Thompson implied that entry plazas and plantings within hardscape plazas may not be sufficient and that a grassy, green pocket park would be ideal.  Committee member Hana Ishikawa also chimed in to support Thompson’s comment about green space, reflecting on her own experience from living in the area and walking her dog in a parking lot. Ishikawa also asked whether the development team has consulted CDOT regarding the midblock crosswalks. Jeff Shapack responded that they are in conversations with CDOT who have guided them to remove the crosswalk across N. Milwaukee Ave and are moving forward with plans for a midblock crosswalk over N. Union Ave. Lesley Roth chimed in to comment that as they navigate designing within this challenging space full of infrastructure, the design team should try to rely less on intra-building connection and focus on the vibrancy of the streets to create a more vibrant public realm without going into the site. Jeff Shapack responded and commented that by building Mews they are avoiding the Chicago history of building lot line to lot line and this approach of public space on their private land is opening space up to the public that would have otherwise been closed off from those users. Juan Moreno made comments about the site’s unique position in the city as a point of multiple arrival and departure access points. Moreno encouraged the design team to consider all of these access points and study views along those corridors. With this as a fringe site inside the city, Moreno also challenged the team to forgo the typical references to the past and old materials and use this site as a chance to start a new design conversation and push it in a direction the city hasn’t thought of before.  Brian Lee commented that the key to the project is multiple levels of connectivity paired with a strong identity. Lee challenged them to push the city on what they can do with a bold idea about new urban space. Personally, Lee prefers the single tower massing over the two-building massing which, in his opinion, would create an urban wall that places people too close together vertically. John Ronan finished off the discussion portion by stating that he feels that the test for the viability of this project is to see how the development can be more than just a sum of its parts. Ronan also criticized the lack of pedestrian scale views to communicate the public realm ideas that were discussed. With the zoning application filed last month and this hearing before the Committee on Design, the massive project inches forward through the city approval process. Situated in the 27th Ward, Shapack will likely engage in multiple community meetings with the public to get feedback. Regarding city approvals, the plan will still need to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and ultimately the full Chicago City Council. ",River West,0.0
Shapack Partners plans multi-tower development around 509 N. Union,"Zoning applications have been filed for a multi-tower development planned by Shapack Partners, with Alec and Jennifer Litowitz as capital partners. Conceived for land surrounding their recently-purchased building at 509 N. Union, the assemblage of sites will total approximately 3.25 acres, bought over a span of six years starting back in late 2016. Developer Shapack Partners has tapped New York-based ODA for the design paired with Chicago-based Eckenhoff Saunders Architects. Organized into two separate zoning applications, the first portion of the development will occupy land at 509 N. Union and 500-520 N. Desplaines. With an overall FAR of 11.5, this segment of the plan is separated into two subareas, one for 509 N. Union and the second for the plot of land along N. Desplaines St.  In Subarea A, the former Salvation Army building will be converted into 141 hotel rooms, with a restaurant on the ground floor. At 500 N. Desplaines, Subarea B will host 700 residential units with commercial and retail space included. The building could top out at a maximum of 600 feet tall with a minimum of 145 parking spaces included in the plan. As part of the large Planned Development, Shapack will meet a 20% affordable housing requirement by providing those subsidized units within the reported rental tower. These first sites will be rezone from C1-5 to DX-7 before being put under the Planned Development designation. As mentioned, the overall development is split into two zoning applications. The second one will occupy land at 708-732 W. Hubbard, 456-476 N. Milwaukee, 461-483 N. Milwaukee, 448-470 N. Union, and 449-467 N. Union. Also expected to have an overall FAR of 11.5, this portion of the plan will be split into three sites, flanking N. Union Ave and N. Milwaukee Ave. Across all three subareas, 800 new residential units are expected. In Subarea A, at the corner of W. Hubbard St and N. Milwaukee Ave, the new construction will hold a portion of those residential units, a minimum of 51 parking spaces, and has the possibility of standing up to 300 feet tall. Within Subarea B, spanning between N. Milwaukee Ave and N. Union Ave up to W. Grand Ave, the new building will offer another slice of the 800 residential units, a minimum of 48 parking spaces, and could rise up to 350 feet tall. The final subarea, located along the east side of N. Union Ave, will hold the remainder of the 800 residential units, a minimum of 76 parking spaces, and could stand up to 490 feet tall. Along the ground floor, a mix of retail spaces and outdoor public space will create an atmosphere potentially similar to The Mews at 167 N Green and the recently approved 170 N. Green, both projects by Shapack Partners. For this portion of the project, Shapack Partners will also provide 20% affordable units within the three towers identified as rentals in the zoning application. The sites for this second portion of the plan will be rezoned from M2-3 and C1-5 to a unified DX-7 and ultimate Planned Development.  With the zoning application filed, the huge plan begins its long process through city approvals. Situated in the 27th Ward, Shapack may likely engage in multiple community meetings with the public to get feedback. Regarding city approvals, the plan will need to go before the Committee on Design, Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and ultimately the full Chicago City Council. ",River West,1.0
City Council approves Bally’s $1.7 billion casino plan,"The Chicago City Council has officially approved Bally’s Corporation plan for a casino and entertainment venue in River West. Planned for the west bank of the Chicago River between W. Chicago Ave and W. Grand Ave, the $1.7 billion venture will replace the Chicago Tribune printing plant.  Approved in a 41-7 vote by alderman, the process has been years in the making as mayor Lori Lightfoot has worked to bring a casino into the city as a new revenue stream to bridge the gap for underfunded police and fire pensions. Despite years of effort and an original five bids, Bally’s Corporation’s River West bid was announced as the winner just three weeks ago. Bally’s casino will offer space for 3,400 slots as well as 170 table games, while the overall plan will go far beyond that. At the northern end of the site, the complex will host a hotel tower with 500 hotel keys. The entertainment complex will incorporate a 3,000-seat theater, a food hall with five restaurants, four bars including a rooftop bar and VIP lounge, an outdoor park, and an amenity terrace that will feature a large pool and spa, fitness center, and sun deck. As part of the agreement with the city, Bally’s will pay $40 million upfront to the city, which has been allocated to the city’s pension funds according to the newly-passed agreement. From now on, Bally’s will pay $4 million annually to the city as part of the deal.  The company has also reportedly committed $75 million towards infrastructure improvements around the casino site, including traffic signal synchronization and widening of adjacent roads. Once the casino is fully up and running, the city estimates an approximately $200 million annual benefit to the city. Regarding job creation, Bally’s has completed an agreement with organized labor, committing to 60% minority hiring and will create a jobs program specifically targeting neighborhoods with the highest levels of unemployment and lowest income. On the terms of equity, Bally’s has provided a unique proposal concerning equity through a crowdfunding initiative, which includes the ability for small investors to leverage up their investment with non-recourse debt. The casino also will create opportunities for small, local restaurants and businesses to have business opportunities in the casino.  With final approval from City Council, the casino plan will now be sent to the Illinois Gaming Board for further vetting. In the meantime, Bally’s will set up a temporary casino at Medinah Temple until the full facility is built at the River West site. The temporary casino is planned for an estimated opening date of summer 2023. ",River West,1.0
Lightfoot selects Bally’s as casino winner,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot has announced that the city has selected Bally’s Corporation to be the recipient of its sole casino license and the developer to create a world-class casino-resort and entertainment experience in Chicago on the site of the Tribune Publishing Center.   The proposal from Bally’s entails a $1.7 billion casino project and hotel on a portion of the current industrial Tribune Publishing Center. This includes a 3,000-seat theater, an Immerse Agency exhibition experience, an extension of the Riverwalk, a pedestrian bridge, a 500-room hotel tower, an outdoor park, an outdoor music venue, an amenity terrace featuring a large pool spa, fitness center and sun deck, and six restaurants, cafes and a food hall. The casino will offer space for 3,400 slots and 170 table games. Bally’s Corporation projected the development will add more than 3,000 construction jobs annually and 3,000 permanent casino jobs. “We would like to thank Mayor Lightfoot and her office for conducting a tough, but fair, RFP process, and selecting Bally’s Chicago as the final bidder for the City’s casino,” said Chairman of Bally’s Corporation Board of Directors Soo Kim.  According to the published press release, the city selected Bally’s Corporation Tribune proposal as it met or exceeded core goals outlined by the casino selection committee. Considering economic and financial benefits to the city, Bally’s offered the strongest overall financial offer to the city, providing a $40 million upfront payment at the time of the signing of the Host Community Agreement along with $4 million annually per year thereafter.  Bally's has also provided the highest minimum capital commitment to the project and is the only submitting operator that did not have a competing casino in the Chicagoland region. For job creation, Bally’s has completed an agreement with organized labor, committing to 60% minority hiring and will create a jobs program specifically targeting neighborhoods with the highest levels of unemployment and lowest income. On the terms of equity, Bally’s has provided a unique proposal concerning equity through a crowdfunding initiative, which includes the ability for small investors to leverage up their investment with non-recourse debt. The casino also will create opportunities for small, local restaurants and businesses to have business opportunities in the casino.  Considering design, planning, amenities, and transportation, the casino is proposed on a site that sits within an important land-use transition zone, with several large-scale existing industrial and commercial uses nearby that will continue to provide critical services to the city. Bally’s will be purchasing the entire Tribune site and is, therefore, flexible in how the other parcels within this planned development can be redeveloped. A temporary casino will be operated at the Medinah Temple. Now that Bally’s Corporation has been selected, a comprehensive host community agreement memorializing the agreed upon terms will be negotiated. The host community agreement will then be evaluated by an Aldermanic special committee. The committee will consist of all the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of City Council Committees as well as President Pro Tempore Alderman Brendan Reilly, 42nd Ward. The Special Committee will be chaired by Alderman Tom Tunney, 44th Ward, and vice-chaired by Alderman Jason Ervin, 28th Ward. All of the City Council will be involved in the process for the final recommendation.   The formal development process will begin following approval from the City Council and the Illinois Gaming Board. On May 9 there will be a subject matter hearing for the special committee to ask questions about the selected finalist. The city will host a community engagement event at UIC Forum, 725 W Roosevelt Road on May 12, 2022 from 7PM - 9PM. The public can register to attend beginning May 5, 2022 at 11AM on the registration page.  In addition to creating thousands of jobs, the casino will generate approximately $400 million a year in gaming and other revenues for the City and the State of Illinois. The City believes that the casino project will meaningfully support Chicago’s tourism industry, finances, job growth, and economic development in addition to enhancing property values in the surrounding area.  ",River West,0.0
Developer scraps plan for four-building megaproject in River West ,"An ambitious plan to transform a 7-acre riverfront site at 700 W. Chicago Avenue into a mixed-use development with four high-rises will not move forward. Chicago-based Riverside Investment & Development and joint venture partner Nexstar Media Group have reportedly given up pursuing tenants for their massive River West project, according to the Chicago Tribune. Dubbed 700 at the River District, the four-phase development would have replaced a former Tribune distribution building with three loft-style office buildings, a 300-unit residential tower, and 4.5 acres of open space. First unveiled in 2017, the  Goettsch-designed proposal received the green light from the Chicago Plan Commission in early 2018. Its developers had originally planned to break ground on the first office tower later that year but struggled to secure the commercial tenants necessary to kickstart construction.  Riverside boss John O'Donnell told Tribune reporter Ryan Ori that although his team ""came very close"" to closing tenant deals over the past years, it made little sense to continue the search given the pandemic-related vacancies plaguing the office market.  ""We thought looking for office tenants right now was a waste of time,"" O'Donnell told the newspaper. ""Nobody knows what kind of space they need. Everyone's evaluating. There's so much vacancy downtown, it doesn't make sense to start a new building like that."" The 7-acre parcel is part of the larger mixed-use 'River District' megadevelopment that includes an additional 30 acres of land to the immediate south, which is currently home to the Tribune's massive Freedom Center printing plant. The city granted Tribune Media zoning approval for up to 14 mixed-use buildings with 4,099 residential units at the River District site in late 2018. The company then put the property up for sale in early 2019. Tribune Media and its real estate assets were acquired by Nexstar later that year. It's unclear what happens next for 700 W. Chicago Avenue (or the greater River District project, for that matter). Although the site was once floated as a possible location for the long-discussed Chicago casino, its existing 120,000-square-foot building seems more likely to become a last-mile distribution center, according to the Tribune report.  News of Riverside and Nexstar's redevelopment plan fizzling out arrives just days after Vancouver-based developer Onni Group revealed its own multiphase megaproject on nearby Goose Island. The proposal—called Halsted Point—calls for five glassy towers to rise at the site of a Greyhound bus maintenance facility located just across the Chicago River from the 700 W. Chicago Avenue site. In fact, 700 at the River District appears in the background of several Halsted Point renderings. Whereas 700 at the River District relied heavily on office tenants to get the project off the ground, Halsted Point will focus on building four residential towers containing a combined 2,650 apartments before starting work on its fifth-phase office building.  ""We believe residential is going be much quicker to come back post-pandemic than commercial,"" said Onni's Brian Brodeur at Friday's virtual community meeting. ""That's the reason we've phased our site the way we have, with our commercial building last.""   ",River West,0.0
River West apartments next to Blue Line near completion,"Few Chicago neighborhoods have experienced a more dramatic change during the city's multiyear apartment boom than River West. Four recent developments—Spoke, Linkt, Avenir, and Westerly—have brought 800 units to the area, and an upcoming project known as Nevele22 will soon add nearly 100 more. Under construction since last spring, the Nevele22 development tops out at seven stories on the northwest corner of Milwaukee and Chicago avenues. Developed by Lipe Property Company and designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the wedge-shaped building will contain 97 apartments atop roughly 6,000 square feet of new retail space. The River West project is located along Milwaukee Avenue's so-called ""Hipster Highway"" bike lanes and is steps from the CTA's Chicago Avenue Blue Line stop. Classified as a transit-oriented development (TOD), Nevele22 will provide on-site parking for 39 vehicles. Zoning for the estimated $18 million project was approved in early 2018. Since the site is located in the city's Near North ARO Pilot zone, the city's affordable housing requirements jumped from 10 to 20 percent. The development will contain all of the affordable units on-site, according to its zoning application.  Nevele22 aims to welcome its first residents later this spring. Meanwhile, workers continue the installation of the building's exterior cladding (no, it wasn't going to stay covered yellow panels forever). ",River West,0.0
Workforce housing at 7603 N. Paulina misses out on funding,"Developer Housing for All LLC’s proposal for a mixed-use workforce housing development at 7603 N. Paulina was reportedly not selected for the highly competitive tax credits from the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA). Announced via Alderwoman Hadden’s newsletter to constituents, the development team plans to reapply and is going to rework plans and the phasing of the project. Planned for the northeast corner of W. Howard St and N. Paulina St, the development will demolish the one-story building at the corner, while preserving the Werner Bros. Storage building, an orange-rated structure built in 1921, despite originally planning to demolish it. The proposal includes plans to construct 104 units over two phases, 82 of which would be set aside for households earning at or below 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI). The remaining 22 would be set aside for households earning at or below 30% AMI. 10% of the units would be set aside as type A fully accessible units, with another 20% set aside as easily adaptable to fully accessible.  With Cordogan Clark & Associates serving as the architect, the corner building would be six stories tall with 52 units, broken down into 7 studios, 11 one-beds, 21 two-beds, and 13 three-beds. 41 of them will be rented at or below 60% AMI, while the remaining 11 will be rented at 30% AMI. The ground floor would hold retail space, a community room, laundry room, fitness center, bike room, resident storage, and management offices. While the developers have committed to retaining the Werner Bros. Storage building, details for the design of the second phase had not been shared. The second phase would bring 52 more units of affordable housing, including 20 inside the Werner Bros. building and 32 apartments in a new construction building in the parking lot to its north. While waiting to reapply for funding, Alderwoman Hadden reported that the development team has met with the Departments of Planning and Development and Housing to discuss the project and get alignment from the city. Housing for All is also using this time to rework their plans for site development. They plan to switch phases - focusing now on rehabilitating the Werner Building and the new construction to the north while leaving the one-story building that houses Redz Belizean and the currency exchange at the corner.  The developers have also closed on the purchase of the properties spanning 7603-7619 N. Paulina and 1646-1660 W. Howard. Work will begin around the building as crews begin to clean the interior, repair windows and doors, add security and new lighting, and secure the site. Additionally, the development team has been working diligently with the retail tenants to ensure a smooth transition to temporary spaces as site work is completed.  ",Rogers Park,0.0
Workforce housing gets updated design at 7603 N. Paulina,"Developer Housing for All LLC has come back with a revised design for a mixed-use workforce housing development at 7603 N. Paulina. Planned for the northeast corner of W. Howard St and N. Paulina St, the development will demolish the one-story building at the corner for its first phase, while deciding to preserve the Werner Bros. Storage building, an orange-rated structure built in 1921, after originally planning to demolish it. With Cordogan Clark & Associates serving as the architect, the corner building has been redesigned while maintaining its height of six stories. Set to include 52 units, the mix will include 7 studios, 11 one-beds, 21 two-beds, and 13 three-beds. 41 of them will be rented at or below 60% AMI, while the remaining 11 will be rented at 30% AMI.  With 4,400 square feet of retail space planned for the ground floor, the developers are looking to keep the existing currency exchange and restaurant as tenants while relocating the post office from its current spot in the existing building. The ground floor of the new building will also hold a community room, laundry room, fitness center, bike room, resident storage, and management offices all along the N. Paulina St frontage. While the developers have now committed to retaining the Werner Bros. Storage building, details for the design of the second phase have not been shared. The second phase will bring 52 more units of affordable housing, including 20 inside the Werner Bros. building and 32 apartments in a new construction building in the parking lot to its north. The $30 million development will need a zoning change and Planned Development designation from the city, requiring hearings before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. The project also needs to get financing from the state to move forward. If approvals and funding are secured, the first phase could break ground in late 2025, with the second phase potentially completed by late 2026. ",Rogers Park,0.0
Workforce housing proposed for 7603 N. Paulina,"Developer Housing for All LLC has proposed a mixed-use workforce housing development at 7603 N. Paulina. Planned for the northeast corner of W. Howard St and N. Paulina St, the development will demolish the one-story building at the corner for its first phase, with the second phase seeing the demolition of the Werner Bros. Storage building, an orange-rated structure built in 1921. With Cordogan Clark & Associates serving as the architect, the final building will stand six floors, delivering 110 residential units as well as approximately 15,000 square feet of ground floor retail space. The project’s unit mix will include 16 studios, 24 one-beds, 42 two-beds, and 28 three-bedroom apartments. 88 of the 110 units will be set aside for households earning at or below 60% AMI, with the remaining 22 units set aside for those earning at or below 30% AMI.  With new retail space on the ground floor, the developer will be working with existing retail tenants to ensure they do not get displaced, including the post office. The development team is exploring new market tax credits, which could help them pass cost savings to potential commercial tenants to keep retail rents affordable. While the underlying zoning at both sites of B1-3 will remain the same, the size of the lot will trigger a Planned Development process. The developer has submitted an application to the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) for an assessment for tax credits. If approved, the application would then go before IHDA's board in June for a final determination. The developer would also seek supplemental financing options from the City of Chicago's Department of Housing. With the proposal still in the early stages of planning, it will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council for the Planned Designation as well as for any city funding requests. If funding and project approval falls into place, construction could start as soon as late 2023 with first move-ins projected for late 2025 ",Rogers Park,1.0
Five-story TOD breaks ground at former Heartland Cafe site,"In Rogers Park, work is underway on a new five-story, mixed-use building at the former site of the Heartland Cafe restaurant. The transit-oriented development will bring 2,500 square feet of retail, 30 residential units, and parking for 15 cars and 30 bicycles to the northwest corner of Lunt and Glenwood avenues. Developer AGE Properties received a permit to break ground on the North Side project back in June 2020 but experienced ""significant delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain shortages, and an electricity grid issue they had to resolve with ComEd,"" according to a recent email notice from Ald. Maria Hadden (49th). The developer initially pitched a six-story structure with 60 units for the site. That plan needed a zoning change and would have required the project to include 10 percent (six units) of affordable housing. Hadden ultimately opposed the zoning change after pushback from the community, so the current proposal is being built ""as of right"" (ie without a zoning change) and will include no affordable units. Designed by SPACE Architects, the upcoming building at 7000 N. Glenwood Avenue will also contain a 467-square foot party room with a 568-square foot exterior deck on the fifth floor. The building permit lists Kelly Construction & Design as the development's general contractor. ",Rogers Park,0.0
Senior apartments envisioned for West Ridge's St. Scholastica Monastery,"In West Ridge, the Benedictine Sisters of Chicago are hoping a zone change will help sell a portion of its 14.5-acre St. Scholastica Monastery campus at 7430 N. Ridge Boulevard to a senior housing developer. No buyer has come forward, but real estate consultants working on behalf of the monastic Roman Catholic community believe a 3-acre piece of the property could support a four- to five-story independent living facility with between 80 and 100 apartments. The Benedictine Sisters have been in Chicago since the mid-1800s, but the group's numbers have declined. The sisters see the proposed independent living development as an opportunity to house its aging membership as well as other seniors living in the surrounding community. ""Our building at one point housed close to 200 women and now we're in the mid-20s and our median age is in the low 80s,"" said Sister Judith Murphy at a Monday night virtual community meeting hosted by Ald. Maria Hadden (49th). ""If we can find a developer to buy the property from us and build, own, and operate a senior housing facility ... It would be a win-win for us and the neighborhood."" A conceptual site plan prepared for the sisters by OKW Architects envisions the new structure at the north end of the St. Scholastica campus. The plan also calls for 134 parking spaces with primary vehicular access from Ridge Road but could include a western connection to Oakley Avenue.  The property's existing school, infirmary, and historic chapel would not be affected, but a two-story residential building and a community garden would be demolished. A portion of the running track along the western edge of the property will need to be realigned to make room for the proposed development. The site at 7430 N. Ridge is currently zoned for charitable educational/institutional uses under an existing Planned Development that would need to be amended to allow a senior living facility. The amendment would trigger the city's Affordable Requirement Ordinance and require any potential developer to provide a percentage of below-market-rate apartments.  The sisters hope to secure the zoning amendment from the city to help market the site to potential buyers. ""Once this additional use is added to this particular parcel, it will allow [the sisters] to start shopping around for developers,"" explained Ald. Hadden.  ""We're not considering any particular development right now, the details aren't there at this time,"" Hadden added. ""We are being asked to consider how we feel about allowing [the senior living] use on this property."" The alderwoman said her office will continue to collect feedback about the plan and will soon distribute an online survey to the community.  ",Rogers Park,0.0

Permits issued for 3140 N. Clybourn,"A full building permit has been issued for a mixed-use development at 3140 N. Clybourn. Occupying a currently vacant parcel, the project site is located along N. Clybourn Ave to the south of the intersection of W. Belmont Ave and N. Western Ave. The development is being led by Chicago-based Range Group, who acquired the lot in 2022. Dubbed The Clybourn, the project’s design is coming from local firm Level Architecture. The five-story building will be clad in dark corrugated metal with accents of aluminum metal paneling, creating texture and shadow. Balconies will break up the facade and hang off the back elevation to provide outdoor space for select units. The ground floor will hold retail space that fronts N. Clybourn Ave, with the residential entry towards the northern side of the street frontage. A fitness center, bike parking, and parking for 27 cars will complete the ground floor. On the upper four floors, 39 apartments will be split into one-beds, two-beds, and three-beds. The building will have a rooftop amenity area and outdoor deck. With the project moving forward under the existing zoning, no city approvals were needed. With the full building permit issued, general contractor McNea and Sons Construction can begin construction. Apartments are set to be delivered in 2024. ",Roscoe Village,1.0
Plan Commission adopts RLE transit development plan,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved and adopted the Red Line Extension (RLE) Transit-Supportive Development Plan. Conceived to help guide development around the upcoming Red Line Extension, the plan sets land use goals and expectations for new community and economic development anticipated as a result of the extension connecting the Far South neighborhoods to the CTA L network. With work underway on the design, the $3.6 billion Red Line Extension will extend the Red Line by 5.6 miles from the current 95th Street terminus down to 130th Street. With four new stations, the Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  The plan outlines four main goals which include increasing residential development variety and affordability; strengthening commercial, retail, and mixed-use development; enhancing public space and greater transportation access; and encouraging economic development, business, and employment generators. A market analysis has shown that this area’s population has been in decline for the last two decades and highlights the need for the Red Line Extension investment to help stabilize the surrounding neighborhoods and recover the lost population. With a land use strategy of development without displacement, the plan sets up an outline for balanced and responsible development to stabilize and increase the population. Strategies include investing in the community though rehabilitation, repair, and reuse of existing buildings; building new catalyst, mixed-use development on lots closest to the stations to spur additional investment; infill the neighborhood with new homes on vacant lots; and to build new mixed-use, commercial, and multifamily developments along major corridors. These options are not necessarily expected to be chronological but can happen at the same time. Envisioning development at each station, the 103rd St station would be seen as an active community hub with new mixed-use buildings next to the station while having a variety of multifamily residential buildings further away. DPD expects there to be the potential for 13,000 square feet of retail space, 800 new housing units, and $360 million in development potential. For the stop at 111th St, the area is being planned as a health and wellness district, with new mixed-use development near the station stepping down in scale as it gets deeper into the neighborhood and connecting to the Roseland Medical District near S. Michigan Ave. DPD expects this area to have a potential for 11,000 square feet of retail, 880 housing units, and $460 million in development potential. At Michigan Ave near 116th, the station area would be seen as a thriving commercial corridor. With the largest potential investment of $850 million, there would be multiple large, mixed-use developments near the station with a potential for 72,000 square feet of retail and 2,100 housing units. Down by Altgeld Gardens, the final station area at 130th is set to become a vibrant and connected community. With the CHA housing already in place, there isn’t as much room for economic development. DPD expects there could be 22,000 square feet of retail and just 55 housing units added to the area with a development potential of $37 million.  With adoption by the Chicago Plan Commission, the next steps for this plan will include attracting development to the key catalyst sites by DPD and implementing the economic development strategies. Going forward, this document will be the framework for development as DPD and CTA coordinate on the construction of the Red Line Extension.  CTA is looking to award the design/build construction contracts by the end of 2024 and begin construction in 2025. The Red Line Extension is targeting a 2029 completion. ",Roseland,0.0
Preliminary landmark approved for Greater Tabernacle Cathedral,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a preliminary landmark recommendation for the Greater Tabernacle Cathedral. Located at 11300 S. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the church was originally the Holy Rosary Catholic Church when it opened in 1890.  Meeting Criterion 1 for heritage, the church traces its origins back to the early settlement of Roseland and Pullman, which were linked economically and socially. The church was the first English-speaking Catholic parish in the area, serving a congregation of mostly Irish immigrants. The congregation flourished with hundreds of member families and by 1916 celebrated being free of their debts.  On March 4th, 1937, fire devastated the church and destroyed everything except for the exterior building structure and the bell tower, including all the interior artwork and ornamentation. The congregation rebuilt the church after the fire and the building has gone on to hold a total of three congregations - Holy Rosary Catholic Church, New Day Ministry International, and Greater Tabernacle Cathedral (since 2016). The building also meets Criterion 3 for its association with a significant person. From 1985-1988, Barack Obama led the Developing Communities Project as its executive director from its organization headquarters in the rectory of Greater Tabernacle Cathedral. As a faith-based organization, DCP was incorporated as a non-profit in 1986 under Obama’s lead and established programming to support the local community through job training, college preparation tutoring, and tenants' rights organizing for the Altgeld Gardens housing projects. With its Romanesque Revival design, the church also meets Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Designed by Solon S. Beman, the church is monumental yet restrained as it features limited ornamentation and its exterior is dominated by projecting cross gable roofs, monumental arched windows, and the juxtaposition between the red brick exterior and limestone base. The church is completed with a commanding bell tower that stands 85 feet tall.  In contrast to the design of the church, the rectory sits at the western end of the complex with an austere design that is absent of ornamentation. Rectangular in plan and two stories in height, the building is crowned by a cascading hipped roof and accentuated with prominent gable dormers and shed dormers. Clad in a dark brown brick, the facade is limited in ornamentation to just inset limestone blocks at gable ends, peaks of gabled dormers, and at gabled dormers as well as the simple relief work below the crown of chimneys on the west and south elevations. For its standing as a work of Solon S. Beman, the church also meets Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect. Beman was a renowned late 19th century and early 20th century architect who designed over 1,300 buildings in the company town of Pullman alone. Other notable works include the Fine Arts Building, Greenstone United Church, and many others. As it stands today, the church clearly retains its historic, architectural, and aesthetic integrity, allowing it to meet the separate Integrity Criterion. With staff recommending 1890 as its period of significance, changes from the 1960s will be outside of the period of significance as they aren’t consistent with the 19th century Romanesque qualities of the design by Beman. Changes include the update to the narthex which brought new interior finishes and new windows with mosaic tiles above the windows. The entrance also was revised with a stainless-steel canopy added alongside the installation of new doors and granite returns. With the preliminary landmark recommendation approved, the building’s significant features would be all exterior elevations including rooflines of the church and rectory buildings. Next steps include further review by landmarks staff before the commission votes on a final landmark recommendation to send the proposed designation to City Hall. There, the Committee on Zoning and City Council would need to vote on it before the church and rectory officially become Chicago landmarks. ",Roseland,0.0
CoD reviews Morgan Park Commons,"The Committee on Design has reviewed plans for Morgan Park Commons, a proposed mixed-use development located at the northwest corner of W. 115th St and S. Halsted St. Addressed at 11420 S. Halsted, the new multi-phase development would be built on the 12-acre site of a former Jewel-Osco that has been vacant for over 16 years. Planned by the Far South Community Development Corporation, the site will be split up into five phases encompassing 150 rental units, 136 townhomes, 18,750 square feet of retail space, and a new 3-acre park with fieldhouse for the neighborhood. Mixed-use apartment buildings will front the main streets of S. Halsted St and W. 115th St in the first two phases, with the third and fourth phases bringing the 136 townhomes. The three-acre park and fieldhouse are planned for the fifth phase, located along the Major Taylor Trail on the west side of the development site. With Lamar Johnson Collaborative on board for the design, the property has been split up with new roadways that will provide access to all of the townhomes and new park inside the large site. Two gateway plazas along S. Halsted St and W. 115th St will celebrate the entry into the development while offering larger spaces for pedestrians over cars. Within the development, streets have been designed as larger boulevards with green medians and more trees and planters. The discussion opened with Reed Kroloff, who questioned the strong axial street in the center of the site connecting east/west to S. Halsted St when there is already a street along the north boundary of the site. The architects responded that the northern street is being used as a service road, but Kroloff noted that it seems like there are a lot of internal streets and wondered if that center boulevard couldn’t be a great pedestrian avenue instead. The developer chimed in to agree that there could be some level of street elimination, but through the community process they added more parking and street access to appease the alderman and community concerns.   Hana Ishikawa commented next, saying that, in reality, most people will likely use that northern road to access the site. Southbound traffic would take it as the first access point while northbound traffic couldn’t use the access at the gateway plaza due to a median, resulting in a likely left turn into the north access point. Ishikawa also commented on the boulevards, calling them problematic due to their large dimension separating people. Additionally, Ishikawa saw the dead-end driveways as very confusing and could make it very hard to get in and out of the site.  Juan Moreno added his thoughts next, thinking that the boulevard should connect into a grander terminus at the park. Turning his attention to the preliminary concepts for the first phase buildings, Moreno commented that the residential entries are getting lost due to the prominence of the retail spaces. Additionally, Moreno commented that the team should spend more time on the back elevation of the buildings to ensure they don’t feel like the back side as they face the rest of the development.  Brian Lee joined the conversation next, noting that the circulation should be diminishing as you get closer to the buildings, and that boulevards can be very dividing. Lee also questioned whether the park should be completed in Phase 1 rather than Phase 5 to help attract residents to the development with that amenity from the start.  John Ronan was the last committee member to comment, beginning by applauding the initiative of building affordable housing. Ronan questioned why the plan departed abruptly in scale from the surrounding context and neglected to continue the urban grid into the parcel. Ronan commented that the taller height of the perimeter buildings gave a fortress-like reading.  The developer responded that the roadway design was based on the existing access points to the site and went the way of the existing fabric after engaging in conversations with CDOT regarding extending the existing streets into the site. In regard to the change in scale, the developer commented that this housing type was chosen due to the lack of it in the neighborhood and the effort to diversify housing in the neighborhood. Ronan closed off his comments by saying that they need to be careful, because if he described a development with larger buildings along the main corridors and shorter townhomes in between, he could be describing Cabrini-Green. Ronan urged that he doesn’t want new development to be making the same mistakes again.  As the development progresses, Far South CDC will need to amend the existing Planned Development on the site. Indicating future approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. A timeline for the development has not been made public. ",Roseland,0.0
CoD reviews Roseland Community Medical District ,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the proposed Roseland Community Medical District. Planned for the Roseland neighborhood, the scope of the master plan is bounded by S. Eggleston Ave to the west, W. 110th St to the north, S. Edbrooke Ave to the east, and W. 112th St to the south.  The project is being put together by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the Far South CDC, the Greater Roseland Chamber of Commerce, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, Applied Real Estate Analysis, and Johnson & Lee Architects.     Planned for a 95-acre region, the plan looks to create a catalytic investment and drive foot traffic to the historic Michigan Ave commercial corridor. Situated within an existing urban neighborhood, the district will reinvest in the community and improve access to healthcare for the community. Working with the CTA, the plan will consider and incorporate the future Red Line extension. With the current trend in healthcare focusing away from large, new hospitals, the district envisions new outpatient care for the neighborhood. The need for mixed-use programming is heavily weighted on outpatient goods and services for the support of healthy lifestyles. The plan looks to drive residential infill based on revitalization via the medical investments. The current plan has identified the intention of the Roseland Community Hospital to build a new surgery center and child birthing space above the existing emergency room. The concept also looks to develop an outpatient campus on three large sites at the intersection of W. 111th St and S. State St.  Planned to move forward through an RFP process, the phased development would include multiple buildings that step up in height to the corner. Medical buildings will line the main street frontages, while the interior of each parcel would be used for community programming including potential supportive housing or community center space. The two programs will be split by an interior spine of green space outdoors. The project also identified the Gately People’s Gas site at 112th and Michigan for redevelopment. As part of the larger plan, this redevelopment could aid in triggering infill development across the entire district.  The discussion opened with comments from Lesley Roth. Roth noticed the housing component and noted that there are many community organizations that are working to infill vacant sites with housing currently and the character of the streets are diverse, and the opportunity can carry more than single-family homes. Roth asked why housing is needed in the medical master plan rather than allowing community organizations to work in tandem to have a broader impact on the neighborhood.  The project team responded that the housing component came out of service providers needing housing within a certain distance of their facility and will focus on adult and youth behavioral supportive housing. With so much opportunity for housing infill, the district goes far beyond just medical space and will partner with those service providers to help fund and deliver housing infill.  Renauld Mitchell jumped in to say that there is a tremendous synergy between housing services and behavioral/mental health services. Mitchell said that they are sold and convinced of that connection.  Hana Ishikawa encouraged the design team to look at how the green sponges can feel more like campus connectors and whether they could be brought out to the public way. Ishikawa mentioned how interior courtyards can tend to not be as occupied as we would like them to and figuring a way to make sure it feels more like their space could improve the outdoor space on site. The project team responded that the design of the interior connector was based on the community concerns around safety and while the main investment is along the exterior, they also want to retain a safe passageway through the project. The team is looking to wrap up the plan by this June to begin the implementation later this year.  ",Roseland,0.0
Downtown Skokie's new tallest building comes together,"Work on downtown Skokie's tallest building is progressing at a rapid pace with a new developer at the helm of the 12-story project under construction at 8000 N. Lincoln Avenue. Known simply as 8000 North, the upcoming $70 million complex features 153 high-end rental units offered in studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom floorplans. There's also an off-street motorcourt fronting Oakton Street, ground-floor retail space, and a parking garage the development shares with the Village of Skokie. Murphy Development Group took over the stalled project last year from a joint venture of Greenspire Capital and Hoffman Homes. The prior development team broke ground on 8000 North in the first part of 2018 but encountered a permit-related delay followed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the site's construction crane coming down. While only the foundation and adjacent parking garage were complete when Murphy took control of the project last fall, the Skokie development has advanced considerably since then. When we went by the site this month, the structure had reached its full height and crews were busy installing precast facade panels that had arrived via flatbed truck. Designed by Chicago architecture firm Lucien Lagrange Studio, 8000 North has a more traditional appearance compared to many recent apartment developments. The beige concrete exterior is meant to look like stone blocks and features teal architecturalal flourishes—similar to Lucien Lagrange's Sixty West Erie tower in River North. John Murphy, chairman and CEO of Murphy Development Group, told Crain's that he expects work on the upcoming apartment complex at 8000 N. Lincoln Avenue to wrap-up later this year or in early 2022.   ",Skokie,0.0

424 S. Wabash secures caisson permit,"A caisson permit has been issued for the mixed-use development at 424 S. Wabash. Planned by DAC Developments, the midblock site is located between E. Van Buren St and E. Congress Pkwy. The property is currently occupied by a vacant parking lot and one-story brick structure.  Designed by Pappageorge Haymes, the site will become home to a 26-story mixed-use tower. Set to rise 285 feet, it will hold 1,800 square feet of ground floor retail space, office space and 280 hotel rooms. The hotel portion will be run by The Sonder Group, a hotelier that specializes in rooms that are akin to apartments, offering visitors spaces that can be larger and more suitable to families and groups.  At the ground floor, retail space will face S. Wabash Ave with the hotel lobby sitting at the south end of the street frontage. Loading, services, and parking will be accessed from the alley. 60 parking spaces will be located within the podium, with an amenity deck on top. Above the amenity deck, Sonder will occupy two floors as office space.   Proposing a fully glazed enclosure, the architects aim to create a glass portal to The Loop between the Roosevelt University tower and this new project. The northern facade will feature a two-toned glass curtain wall, referencing the design of Roosevelt University’s tower. With a context of rich, historic brick buildings, the glass design aims to contribute to the area by reflecting those structures rather than competing with them.   With the site already zoned as DX-16, the hotel use is permitted by-right on the property, allowing the developers to proceed without any city review. With the caisson permit issued, general contractor McHugh Construction can begin work on the $87 million development. Further permits for the superstructure and full building have yet to be filed.

As the second building in the developer’s Southbank master plan along the Chicago River, The Reed is a hybrid residential building offering both rental and for-sale options.  “As one of the first residential towers developed directly on the Chicago River south of Madison Street, The Reed is a rare offering that allows residents to live – and own – along the river in the heart of downtown, with a 2-acre park as their backyard,” said Jon Cordell, director of development, management and operations, for the central region at Lendlease.  Perkins&Will is designing the Reed, which draws from the industrial character of Printer’s Row with a sleek dark exterior which translates into the interior design of the building. Homes feature nine-foot custom concrete ceilings and metal accents enhanced with luxury features such as floor-to-ceiling windows and six-inch wide-plank hardwood flooring. Kitchens include Bosch appliances, quartz countertops, a porcelain backsplash, and large islands with architectural steel legs. Baths feature custom-designed vanities and Kohler and Hansgrohe fixtures. Buyers can choose from three different finish packages. Some residences feature balconies overlooking the Chicago River and cityscape. For-sale homes, located on floors 23 through 41, comprise 216 of The Reed’s 440 total residences. Ranging from 630 to 1,660 square feet, condos include one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans priced from the low $400,000s to $1.4 million. Condominium owners have exclusive access to a dedicated suite of amenities located on the second floor, including a fireplace lounge, show kitchen and flexible workspaces. A covered outdoor terrace on the building’s northwest corner overlooks the adjacent river and Southbank Park, the publicly accessible green space at the center of the Southbank master plan that features its own riverwalk section linking Harrison and Polk streets. Condo residents will also have access to amenities on the eighth floor shared with renters, featuring a 15,000-square-foot outdoor amenity deck with a resort-style pool and cabanas, a sunning lawn and fire pits. Addressing heightened interest in outdoor entertaining, the deck also includes fully equipped kitchens and dining areas. The amenities continue indoors with an expansive fitness center connected to the outdoor exercise terrace, with dedicated HIIT and yoga spaces, and cardio and strength training equipment. Other offerings include a wet lounge, show kitchen and dining room; lounge room with TVs, billiards table and seating areas that can double as workspaces; virtual sports simulation room; salon; massage and media rooms. “We have found the hybrid model, offering both for-sale and rental homes, works very well for a variety of reasons, including the ability to offer a wider range of amenities that are simply much better than typical condominium buildings, without excessive monthly assessments,” according to Jon Cordell, director of development, management and operations, for the central region at Lendlease. ”In most condominium buildings, the scale and variety of amenities that are available at The Reed would price out many buyers who would otherwise have to pay much higher assessments.” The Reed is built to achieve LEED Gold, Fitwel and ENERGY STAR certifications. Lendlease, which plans to reach absolute zero carbon by 2040 used a propriety low embodied carbon concrete in the construction of The Reed. The development also continues Lendlease’s partnership with The Roof Crop, installing and maintaining rooftop flower beds, U-Pick gardens and beehives from which honey will be harvested for use by residents and local businesses. Prospective buyers can tour three furnished models at The Reed by appointment. For more information, call (312) 260-9797 or visit www.thereedsouthbank.com. ",South Loop,0.0
Foundation permit issued at 1723 S. Michigan,"A foundation and partial superstructure permit has been issued for a residential development at 1723 S. Michigan. Planned by Chicago-based CMK Companies, the project has progressed under the radar as it has not requested any zoning change or variances. Zoned DX-5, the extent of the project site isn’t fully clear but will sit across the street from CMK’s 1720 S. Michigan. With Gensler reportedly behind the architecture, the permit reports a 13-story building is set to rise on the property. The development will have 149 apartment units with 98 parking spaces on the first three floors. Retail space and the residential lobby will occupy the front of the ground floor with parking behind. With the foundation and partial superstructure permit issued, general contractor Brandts Build LLC can begin working on the structure for the first through second floor and build the core, concrete stairs and walls to the underside of the sixth floor. A full building permit has been filed and is awaiting issuance. ",South Loop,0.0
Crescent Heights lists NEMA Phase 2 site for sale,"Miami-based developer Crescent Heights has listed the vacant site at 1201 S. Michigan in the South Loop. Measuring 43,123 square feet, the property is at the southeast corner of W. Roosevelt Rd and S. Michigan Ave overlooking Grant Park. According to Crain’s, the developers have hired CBRE to market the property. Sited directly adjacent to the 76-story skyscraper NEMA Chicago that Crescent Heights finished in 2019, the site was once planned to get a second phase of NEMA, which would have risen approximately 900 feet and include an additional 621 units. The zoning entitlements for a tower of this scale will stay in place for a future developer to use or modify. The marketing information included that the site could have one tall tower, or two shorter buildings built in phases.  Crescent Heights has owned the property since 2012 but cite a focus on Fulton Market as reasoning for trying to offload this property. The developer has entitlements for a 38-story, 425-foot-tall residential tower at 640 W. Washington and is working through the approval process on a 615-foot-tall skyscraper at 420 N. May.  ",South Loop,0.0
1000M tops off over Grant Park,"1000M has officially topped off, with the final floor of concrete poured for the 73-story tower. Developed by Time Equities, JK Equities, and Oak Capitals, the skyscraper will tower above Grant Park providing sweeping views of the Loop and Lake Michigan.  Designed by the late Helmut Jahn, the 805-foot-tall tower features a highly sculpted form with an angled, cantilevered base topped by glass-clad residential floors that widen as the building rises. With 738 apartment units, residences will range from studios to three-bedroom penthouse units. 325 car parking spaces and 356 bike parking spaces will be included in a large parking garage at the back of the building. Future tenants will have 80,000 square feet of amenities including a golf simulator room, an outdoor swimming pool with cabanas, a cookout area, a resident lounge and commercial kitchen, an indoor pool and spa, a two-level fitness center, and a partial basketball court. With McHugh Concrete topping out the structure, general contractor McHugh Construction can continue installing the glass curtain wall and working on the interior buildout. With the property showroom set to open this fall, the project’s website is live and prospective residents can join the pre-leasing priority list here. Completion of the building is set for summer 2024. ",South Loop,0.0
1000M launches marketing as tower nears topping out,"Co-developers Time Equities, JK Equities, and Oak Capitals have officially launched the marketing campaign for 1000M as the structure nears topping out. Rising above Grant Park in the South Loop, the 73-story tower is set to transform the Chicago skyline. With a newly launched website – www.1000MChicago.com - interested renters can be the first to get priority invites to tour the property’s showroom opening this Fall, as well as sneak peaks at unit plans, renderings, construction updates, and they will be among the first to have access to select their apartment home in the new tower.  New renderings feature a glimpse of what the tower will look like when it’s complete as well as a few examples of the 738 lavish apartments in the building and the rooftop pool amenity deck for the building, just part of the over 80,000 square feet of amenity offerings for future tenants. 1000M was designed by the late, luminary German architect Helmut Jahn and his company, Jahn, which remains the architectural firm of record for the development. Renowned Chicago-based interior designer, Kara Mann, designed the apartment and amenity area interiors.  “We think that luxury apartment renters in Chicago are going to be extremely impressed with 1000M. We’ve had the benefit of time to completely redesign the apartments and public areas – every detail has been carefully optimized. We hope to exceed resident expectations, which is, of course, not an easy thing to do,” said Robert Singer, Director of Development at TEI. “And beyond the tower itself, the South Michigan Ave/Grant Park/Museum Campus neighborhood has continued its dramatic evolution into maybe the premier residential neighborhood in the city,"" Singer added. With McHugh Construction serving as the general contractor, photos show the progress of the building with the concrete structure nearly topped out and the curtain wall facade following behind it. First unit deliveries are anticipated in Spring 2024, with additional units being delivered in phases throughout the balance of 2024. ",South Loop,0.0
City Council approves housing at 1800 S. Michigan,"The Chicago City Council has approved a residential development at 1800 S. Michigan. Located along E. 18th St, the project consists of an existing building at 1801 S. Wabash and a surface parking lot at 1800 S. Michigan. With Mercy Housing in charge of the project, the development consists of the rehabilitation of the existing residential building at 1801 S. Wabash and the new construction of another affordable residential building at 1800 S. Michigan. With Nia Architects in charge of the design, the new residential building at 1800 S. Michigan will stand five stories tall, set to deliver 50 affordable residential units. The 50 residential units will be split into 39 one-beds and 11 two-beds, with residents having access to a rooftop deck and community room on the fifth floor. On the ground floor, the residential lobby will be at the corner, with the fitness center and yoga room fronting S. Michigan Ave and the E. 18th St frontage flanked with management offices, the laundry room, and computer stations for the residents. The remaining space on the ground floor will hold 14 parking spaces. Rising 63 feet tall, the building will be clad in a material palette of three different colors of brick with aluminum windows and juliet balconies to create a contextual building for the neighborhood. The ground floor facade has been designed with storefront glazing to enhance the pedestrian experience along the building. The existing building will have no significant changes to the building structure, but the interior will be renovated and reconfigured with a new interior layout. The ground floor will hold the in-house management offices, a residential lobby, package room, an activity room, a recreation room, and a fitness center. The SRO building will be converted into 100 studio units that will be fully affordable. Behind the building, the courtyard will get new amenities including a playground and bike storage. As mentioned, the development will be an entirely affordable project. With a total of 150 units, the apartments will be income-restricted to an average of 60% AMI. This distinction will allow for some of the units to be rented at 80% AMI, allowing Mercy Housing to continue providing housing to some current residents in the Wabash building who are over the 60% AMI threshold.  With City Council approval secured, the sites will be rezoned from DX-5 and DR-3 to a unified DR-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. The project is seeking city funding before moving forward with construction. ",South Loop,1.0
ZBA approves variances for 1700 S. Wabash,"The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a set of variances for a residential development at 1700 S. Wabash. Located across from Fred Anderson Park, the 48-foot-wide site is just north of the CTA Substation at 1714 S. Wabash. The subject property is currently vacant and has no alley access due to the CTA tracks behind the parcel. Developed by CMK Development, the new residential building will rise 9 floors and host 37 apartments. The unit mix will consist of 11 studios, 10 one-beds, 14 two-beds, and two three-bedroom units on the top floor. 4 parking spaces will be provided inside the ground floor towards the back of the building. Designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners, the ground floor will occupy the full site, with the residential entry and garage entry both facing S. Wabash Ave. Starting on the second floor, the residential tower sets back from the south and west property lines and gives second floor units outdoor terraces. Clad in a glass and metal window wall system, the tower massing continues up vertically until the ninth floor, where the building steps in from the east and west sides to create terraces for the two three-bedroom units. The tower will top out at 115 feet with mechanical screens blocking the mechanical units from view. The project received a series of variances from the Zoning Board of Appeals. The first approval was for a special use to establish a residential use below the second floor. The first variation was to reduce the rear setback from the required 30' to 15'. The second variation will allow alternative compliance with the open space requirements for the project. Due to the constrained lot size and dimensions, the third variation allows for the reduction of off-street parking spaces from the required thirty-seven to four. The final variation was to permit a proposed 14' wide driveway to access the development despite its location on a pedestrian street due to the lack of alley access. With ZBA approval, CMK Development can move forward with the project at this site. Permits have yet to be filed or issued and a timeline is currently unknown. ",South Loop,0.0
Urbanize tours The Reed,"Urbanize recently toured The Reed, a 41-story residential tower at 234 W. Polk that first welcomed residents at the beginning of June. As a hybrid between rental apartments and condominiums, The Reed is the second residential high-rise in Lendlease’s 7-acre Southbank master plan development which is rising up along the Chicago River in the South Loop. Designed by Perkins & Will, the high-rise features an industrial-modern aesthetic, with a sleek dark exterior that transitions seamlessly through to interiors, which showcase 9-foot custom-finish concrete ceilings, wide-plank wood flooring and expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. With the tour led by Lendlease, we began by walking through the lobby which includes a fireplace, hospitality-style bar, and a variety of seating configurations for remote work and small social gatherings. Overlooking the river, the building will have a public riverwalk that passes by the lobby to connect to Southbank Park.  Heading up into the building, we next looked at a series of model units within the building. Out of the 440 total units, 224 of them are rental apartments and they are located on floors 9 through 22. The mix includes studios, convertibles, one-beds, two-beds, and three-beds ranging from 544 to 1,417 square feet, with monthly rents starting at $2,205 for studios and convertibles, $2,610 for one-bedrooms, $3,880 for two-bedrooms, and $5,430 for three-bedrooms. Apartment kitchens include stainless steel appliances, honed black granite countertops and flat-panel, soft-close cabinetry with under-cabinet lighting. Baths feature frameless glass showers, quartz countertops and Hansgrohe and Kohler fixtures. Residences offer views of the downtown skyline, adjacent Southbank Park and Chicago River, per plan, and select units also include balconies. Stopping next on the 8th floor, The Reed offers a full floor of amenities for the tenants. The interior offers an expansive fitness center that connects to the outdoor exercise area and includes dedicated HIIT and yoga spaces; a wet lounge adjacent to the pool deck; show kitchen and dining room; lounge room with TVs, a pool table and seating areas that can double as workspaces; virtual sports simulation room; salon; massage room; and media room. Heading outside, the outdoor deck features a series of grilling stations and outdoor seating that face the river, while the south side of the deck will be home to The Roof Crop at The Reed, whose green rooftop will house flower beds and U-Pick gardens, as well as apiaries from which honey will be harvested for use by residents and local businesses. On the north side of the amenity deck, the main feature is a large pool that is surrounded by seating and cabanas while complemented by a sunning lawn and fire pits for residents to gather around. Residents can take in the expansive views of downtown and The Willis Tower from this outdoor deck while also overlooking Southbank Park, the central open space of the development designed by Hoerr Schaudt. Like other multifamily buildings in Lendlease’s portfolio, The Reed is designed to achieve LEED Gold, Fitwel and ENERGY STAR certification, a reflection of the company’s focus on sustainability and wellness. The first building in Chicago to use a proprietary low-carbon concrete during construction, The Reed supports the company’s goal to achieve absolute zero carbon by 2040.   Furnished models and a new leasing center in the building are now available for tours seven days a week. Appointments are preferred, but walk-ins will be accommodated based on availability. For more information or to schedule a tour, call (312) 260-9797 or visit www.thereedsouthbank.com. Pre-sales for condominiums at The Reed continue at the sales gallery on the 29th floor of The Cooper.

The for-sale residences are priced from the low $400,000s, with first move-ins in July. ",South Loop,0.0
City Council approves Thrive Exchange South,"The Chicago City Council has approved Thrive Exchange South, a mixed-use development planned for 7901 S. Exchange. As the winner of a recent Invest South/West RFP, the project will reactivate the intersection at the 79th St Metra stop. Planned by DL3 Realty, the project site is located at the southeast corner of S. Exchange Ave and E. 79th St, with a two-story existing building that will be demolished. Designed by KOO, the project will encompass a six-story mixed-use building topping out at 78 feet with a new landscaped plaza. A retail plaza will face the Metra tracks and the intersection, with a tenant amenity deck on the second floor overlooking it. The facade is drawn from the context of the Ringer Building, with choices selected to complement its materiality. A warm brick mix will be paired with copper metal panels at the bay windows and lower recessed spaces. The arched openings draw from the arches at the Ringer Building.  The development will deliver 43 affordable workforce housing units renting at 60% AMI, split into 4 studios, 20 one-beds, and 19 two-beds. The east side of the ground floor of the building will have retail space and offices for Neighborhood Housing Services.

City Council approves new Epic Academy facility,"The Chicago City Council has approved a new school facility for Epic Academy. Located at 8231 S. South Shore, the new school will occupy the former St. Michael’s school building and see the construction of an addition on its north side, replacing two residential properties. To the south, a one-story auxiliary building and three-story convent will be demolished. With the goal of creating a state-of-the-art school, architects JGMA have led the design process using the history and the past as a springboard for the future. Their design holds the former school in high regard while creating a new experience for the students with the new four-story addition on the north side of the building. The new addition includes a new entry to connect with the community and underscore the new feeling for students. Programmatically, the addition holds spaces that will connect the school with the community and families, while most of the classrooms will stay in the original building. The gymnasium has been elevated to the top of the building to bring people up and connect with the community while capitalizing on the view as an amenity.  With the new addition designed in the round, all facades will be clad in a terracotta rainscreen system that adds a vertical rhythm inspired by the existing building. As it presents itself to the neighborhood and the students, the new building entry is inset at an angle, creating a dynamic new entry space. Considering sustainability, the building will meet LEED Silver or better in addition to other strategies to meet the city’s sustainable development requirements. Strategies include exceeding energy code, providing solar panels on the roof, exceeding the stormwater ordinance, planting trees, installing green roofs, reducing the indoor water use, providing bike parking, including bird protection, and being in proximity to transit. The project is currently in the design development phase, with acquisition of the site contingent on the now-approved zoning change. Due to significant water infiltration, roofers will be brought in to stabilize the building as soon as possible. While the fundraising process is still ongoing, the school hopes to be in the building by 2024 or 2025. ",South Shore,0.0

CDC approves TIF for Thrive Exchange,"The Community Development Commission has approved $10.2 million in TIF funding and a land sale for Thrive Exchange, a mixed-use development planned for 7901 S. Exchange. As the winner of a recent Invest South/West RFP, the project will reactivate the intersection at the 79th St Metra stop. Planned by DL3 Realty, the commission solely considered the southern building out of the multi-building plan. Designed by KOO, the project will encompass a six-story mixed-use building topping out at 76 feet with a new landscaped plaza. The development will deliver 43 affordable workforce housing units renting at 60% AMI, split into 4 studios, 20 one-beds, and 19 two-beds.

The ground floor of the building will also hold retail space as well as an office space for Neighborhood Housing Services. Through the design process, massing options studied included a low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise building for the site. The current design reflects the mid-rise option, allowing for small green spaces on the ground floor while creating enough density to activate the area. A retail plaza will face the Metra tracks and the intersection, with a tenant amenity deck on the second floor overlooking it. Residents will access the building off S. Exchange Ave with a dedicated bike room entry also along the west side. Residents will park on a surface lot holding 45 spaces along the Metra tracks before entering through a rear door.

Regal Mile Studios breaks ground,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined city, community, and business leaders at a groundbreaking ceremony for Regal Mile Studios. Located at 7700 S. Stony Island, The Regal Mile Studios Campus 1 is a 380,000 square foot, seven-acre enclosed media campus and sound stage development planned by Loop Capital Real Estate Partners.  “Through this $100M investment to develop a new, state-of-the-art media campus in the South Shore neighborhood, INVEST South/West will expand educational opportunities for young people and equip them with the skills they need to thrive and succeed in the film and media industry,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “I am thrilled that this project not only puts community voices front and center, but also enhances Chicago’s presence in the entertainment industry. Ultimately, this development will support our South Side residents and contribute to our prosperous, post-pandemic recovery.”   Designed by Bauer Latoza Studio, the development will include three film studios, office space, staging areas, and 95 parking spaces. The triangular site will be composed of three areas. The first is the main studio parcel, holding the three mains studio and office structures. Two other smaller parcels include the northwest parking lot and a smaller parcel south of the parking lot that will have a green room, which is a prep area for actors.  The main site is organized around a central internal portion that acts as open flex space, offering an internal outdoor yard for staging and access for staff. Placed around this central area, three studio buildings each measure 20,000 sf with 40 feet interior clear height space for filming and set building. Located out from the studio structures are attached office spaces. Rising 28 feet, the two-story portions will face the street, blocking views of the taller 52-feet tall studio enclosures. The office portions are faced with lively facades that face the neighborhood.  All three elevations facing the surrounding streets will be treated with the same architectural expression. The facade is a vibrant pattern of form and color that takes cues from street art and filmstrips. The resulting vibrant linear design is present on all three frontages using metal paneling as the material.  With approvals coming back in 2021, construction will now begin and is set to complete for a Fall 2024 occupancy.  ",South Shore,0.0
Developers plan 22-story tower at 7162 S. Exchange,"Developers Model of Transformation Design and Development have proposed a mixed-use tower at 7162 S. Exchange. Currently a vacant lot, the project site is located at the northwestern corner of S. Exchange Ave and E. 72nd St. The site, which was once home to the Food Exchange supermarket, overlooks the South Shore Metra stop and is down the street from the South Shore Cultural Center. The 22-story mixed-use tower is set to hold 153 residential units, with 80% of them planned to be market-rate and the remaining 20% set aside as affordable. Residents will be able to choose from one-bed, two-bed, and three-bed configurations. The base of the building will include 15,000 square feet of ground floor retail space with 100 car parking spaces above. Tenants will have access to amenities including a swimming pool, rooftop restaurant, and rooftop deck. With JGMA in charge of the design, the vision for the project is intended to raise the bar of what development should look like in the South Shore neighborhood. Designed to serve as an anchor for the neighborhood while bringing new architectural and cultural vision to the community, the building will feature an iconic wrapping façade that integrates the base of the building, twisting up through the tower where it eventually meets the top overhang. The dynamic façade creates a series of sculptural colored balconies with unobstructed views of the city’s lakefront and downtown.  In the early stages of planning, the developers are pursuing zoning approval from the city while pursuing funding. Estimated to cost $61 million, the developers are seeking funding through the Chicago Recovery Grant program as well as by pursuing state capital grants, clean energy financing, community investments, and crowdfunding.

A retail plaza will face the Metra tracks and the intersection, with a tenant amenity deck on the second floor overlooking it. Residents will access the building off S. Exchange Ave with a dedicated bike room entry also along the west side. Residents will park on a surface lot holding 45 spaces along the Metra tracks before entering through a rear door. The facade is drawn from the context of the Ringer Building, with choices selected to complement its materiality. A warm brick mix will be paired with copper metal panels at the window and lower recessed spaces. The arched openings draw from the arches at the Ringer Building.  Addressing the pedestrian experience of the busy corner, the currently wide intersection will be condensed to expand sidewalks and create a colorfully integrated plaza. The plaza speaks to bringing people and activity to the site, with a pocket park on the west side of the building for residents and increased sidewalk planters to increase the desirability of being a pedestrian here. The discussion began with Jeanne Gang who asked whether there could be more permeable surfaces in the landscaping to allow for more space around trees to increase comfort through the urban tree canopy. The team from KOO commented that it is certainly something to consider because there are not a lot of large scale, shade providing trees, so they will look at doing less planters and more green surface areas as they progress with the design.  The next member, Andre Brumfield, asked whether the flex space adjacent to the plaza would be used for future retail or a different use. The developers commented that the space is a work-in-progress and is currently seen as a quasi-public amenity space. The community is looking for gathering space and they are working with the management company to make the decision on what the space would be. If it is not used as community space it would become more retail space. Maria Villalobos chimed in next to further Jeanne’s comment by asking about moving the parking further south so a line of trees could be added along the walkway to the building. The developers responded that they have to work within a 15-foot setback from Metra property, but they also want more trees in open green space rather than small planters. Committee member Eleanor Gorski commended the team on preserving the adjacent historic building and liked the fact that the new building was pulled away from the corner to give more visual connection to the Ringer Building. Catherine Baker chimed in to comment that she felt the selection of brick was a surprising move and added a level of texture and detail that she found to be wonderful. Baker encouraged the design team to fight through the value engineering process to keep the brick.  While exact details are not available, the project may need to undergo a rezoning process. Developers will also need approvals for acquiring the city-owned land and settling on a redevelopment agreement. A timeline for approvals and construction has not been announced. ",South Shore,1.0
Thrive Exchange selected as winner for South Shore Invest S/W RFP,"As part of the two-year anniversary of Invest South/West, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the winners of three more RFP’s, including the South Shore RFP. This RFP, as well as the other two, were selected from a pool of developer responses that came after the RFP’s were announced in April by the Department of Planning and Development (DPD). Developed as a joint venture between DL3 Realty, Revere Properties, and Claretian, Thrive Exchange was selected as the winner out of two submissions. Designed by KOO, the proposal is planned for multiple sites adjacent to the Cheltenham station on Metra Electric’s Main Line located near the intersection of E. 79th Street and S. Exchange Avenue.  The $47.3 million development will produce a mixed-use project, creating 39 residential units on the south side of E. 79th Street in a new building. The historic Ringer Building will be converted into commercial space, including potential retail and restaurant uses as well as a community health center. The second new structure will rise to the north of the Ringer Building, holding 24 for-sale condominium units. The winning design will need to go through refinements via an additional community engagement process before going through the official review and approval process of the city. Approvals will potentially be required from the Community Development Commission, Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and the full Chicago City Council. A hearing in front of the Committee on Design is also expected. Construction is reportedly expected to begin by Fall 2022. ",South Shore,1.0
Two teams respond to city's request to redevelop South Shore site,"The City of Chicago is evaluating redevelopment proposals from a pair of teams hoping to revitalize a 1.7-acre site at 79th Street and Exchange Avenue in the South Shore community. The transit-oriented development would span two parcels containing vintage low-rise buildings and vacant land near the Cheltenham stop on Metra's Electric Main Line. Two teams responded to the city's Request for Proposals (RFP), which is part of the  INVEST South/West initiative to bring new vibrancy to revitalize key commercial corridors in historically underserved neighborhoods. The city recently selected winning proposals for vacant city-owned parcels in communities including Bronzeville, North Lawndale, South Chicago, and New City/Back of Yards. Here's a look at the two visions for the 79th and Exchange location.  Development team: AIE Development Group, Urban Array Impact Dev., Brennan Investment, Group Keely Construction
Design team: Ware Macomb, BTR Engineering
Cost: TBD The Array Innovation Exchange team proposes a mixed-use, mixed-income complex containing 40 to 50 residential units, three to five retail storefronts, and the new home of the Museum of Black Technology and Engineering. The existing Ringer Building would retain its historic facade within the modern exterior of the complex on the south side of 79th Street. The development would feature rooftop greenhouses for vertical farming serving several restaurants. Other proposed uses include a coffee shop and roaster, a digital media studio, and/or a start-up incubator space. On-site parking would be provided for 36 vehicles. Development team: DL3 Realty Advisors, Revere Properties, Claretian
Design team: KOO LLC, dbHMS, Site, Pioneer, McRostie
Cost: $65 million The Thrive Exchange team envisions a mixed-use, mixed-income project anchored by 86 rental apartments and 24 for-sale condominiums on both the north and south side of 79th Street. The proposal's commercial spaces include 11,000 square feet for retail and restaurant uses. The Ringer Building would be preserved and repurposed as medical offices plus collaborative space for local businesses. The plan would provide parking for 140 vehicles. ",South Shore,0.0
Ten-unit condo development headed to South Shore,"Chicago's South Shore community is about to get its first new condominium development in years. A four-story, ten-unit masonry building will soon break ground at a long-vacant lot located at the end of a cul-de-sac at 3012 E. 78th Street—across from Rainbow Beach Park. On Thursday, the Chicago Plan Commission approved a Lakefront Protection Ordinance application for the South Side site. The vote is a crucial step in the approval process for the estimated $7 million undertaking.  The project at 3012 E. 78th Street comes from developer Elam Industries LLC. The company is led by local South Shore resident Anita Richardson, who intends to occupy one of the building's ten for-sale units when the structure is complete.  Each residence features an open floorplan, elevator service, 11-foot ceilings, and views of the park and Lake Michigan. The development will use two existing parking spaces as well as provide parking for eight more cars in attached rear garages. ID Architecture serves as project designer. The condos will sell for between $649,000 to $799,000, according to Crain's Chicago Business, and two units are currently listed for sale by Real Properties Realty Group. Elam Industries plans to hold a groundbreaking ceremony later this month, begin construction in August, and welcome residents in spring 2022. The upcoming condo project wasn't the only South Shore development approved by the Chicago Plan Commission. The commissioners also gave preliminary zoning to a $60 million film production studio slated for a 7-acre site at 1525 E. 77th Street.  ",South Shore,0.0
South Shore film studios move forward,"An ambitious proposal to build a massive film production facility around the corner from the historic Avalon Regal Theater is moving forward in Chicago's South Shore community. Dubbed the Regal Mile Studios, the project was granted preliminary zoning approval by the Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday, July 15. The South Side development replaces a sprawling site between the Chicago Skyway and Stoney Island Avenue. Plans call for transforming the mostly vacant 7-acre parcel into five sound stages, flex space, ""green room"" facilities, supporting offices, and off-street parking for 95 vehicles. The Regal Mile Studios are a joint venture between Chicago developer Loop Capital Markets and Derek Dudley, a producer of Showtime's The Chi series who grew up in the South Shore neighborhood. Chicago-based Bauer Latoza Studio serves as design architect, according to the project's zoning application. The development team held several meetings with members of the public as well as city officials to refine their proposal. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development (DPD) had input on the contemporary design of the facade and requested the addition of trees and landscaping throughout the site. A public plaza was also added to the plan based on feedback from the community, according to materials posted by DPD.  The estimated $60 million project could be a major economic driver for the immediate area. It would create 250 construction jobs plus 34 permanent positions and roughly 300 production-related jobs during filming. The studio could also give a much-needed boost to struggling local businesses—and perhaps even kick-start the restoration of the landmark Avalon Regal Theater, which has sat vacant for more than a decade.  ""[South Shore is] in dire need of meaningful investment that will uplift the community,"" Derek Dudley told Crain's Chicago Business earlier this year. ""It's been forgotten. It's not the South Shore community I grew up in."" The Regal Mile Studios project isn't the only indication that Chicago's film industry is moving from strength to strength. Established production company Cinespace Studios is currently planning a big expansion of its North Lawndale campus. Meanwhile, a different group of developers is eyeing studio space in a former Marshall Field warehouse building located northwest of Logan Square.  On Tuesday, the Chicago Community Development Commission voted to approve the sale of six parcels of city-owned land at 1433-43 E. 77th Street and 7700-08 S. Blackstone Avenue for $31,000 to the development team.     ",South Shore,0.0
Red Line Extension receives $100 million grant,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has announced that the Red Line Extension Project, which will build a 5.6-mile extension of the Red Line to 130th Street, will receive another $100 million of federal funding, moving the project closer to the CTA’s goal of breaking ground in 2025. The project will receive a $100 million grant from the federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ)/Carbon Reduction Program, after receiving $30 million from the same source in 2021. The announcement follows the recent notification from the Federal Transit Administration in September 2023 that the RLE project was in line to receive $1.973 billion of federal “New Starts” funding. “CTA is successfully putting together the critical funding we need to build the transformational Red Line Extension, which will increase access to transit for Far South Side residents and serve as an economic catalyst for the region,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The Red Line Extension will improve residents’ quality of life by increasing access to jobs, education and more. I thank our federal partners for the continuing support of this life-changing project.” Originally promised by then Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1969, the Red Line Extension will look to extend the CTA Red Line past 95th St all the way down to the city’s southern border near 130th St. With work underway on the design, the $3.6 billion project will add another 5.6 miles of heavy rail and connect the Far South Side communities with 4 new stations. The Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  The remaining project funding will come from a $950 million Transit TIF approved by Chicago City Council in 2022 and other sources. The CTA is looking to award construction contracts in late 2024 and begin construction in 2025. The new Red Line Extension is targeted for a 2029 completion. ",South Side,0.0
CTA lands almost $2 billion in funding for Red Line Extension,"In a major milestone for the long-awaited transit project, the Federal Transit Administration has announced that the Red Line Extension (RLE) project is in line for $1.973 billion in critical grant funding needed to build the project. The grant would be the largest transit infrastructure grant awarded to CTA in the agency’s history. ""Reversing decades of disinvestment starts with providing accessible transportation for all residents of this city,"" said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “Today’s announcement serves as an important milestone for this project as we move to enhance capillary connections to create a more connected and accessible Chicago. We will continue to work with stakeholders, the state, and federal government to ensure this project is moving full steam ahead.” The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) notified CTA that the $3.6 billion RLE Project has advanced into the next phase of the federal “New Starts” program – an important step to moving the project closer to groundbreaking. CTA can now begin the “Engineering” phase of the project, which includes further design and engineering needed to build the project and identifies the federal grant dollars CTA can receive for the project once the engineering phase is completed and approved by FTA.  The infrastructure project will add another 5.6 miles of heavy rail both elevated and on grade with 4 new stations. The Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  “Today is a great day for the South Side of Chicago,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “The Far South Side has been promised for 50 years that the Red Line would be extended to the city’s southern border, and today we can say that promise is significantly closer to being met. This project brings a wealth of job and training opportunities, and it enhances the quality of life for residents who will be able to access jobs and education more easily than ever before.” The Engineering phase of the project is expected to continue into 2024 and anticipates a funding award by the end of 2024 subject to federal review and approvals. The remaining project funding will come from a $950 million Transit TIF approved by Chicago City Council last year and other sources. ",South Side,0.0
CTA adds electric bus service to South Side,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) recently announced the roll-out of its newest fully accessible, all-electric buses to the #63 63rd route beginning this week after equipping its third bus facility to support all-electric buses. Today’s announcement marks the latest milestone in CTA’s efforts to convert to an electrified bus fleet by 2040 as part of CTA’s “Charging Forward Plan”. ""Improving bus services and connections for our most transit dependent riders has been and remains a priority for me and our expansion of all-electric buses to serve Chicago’s Far South Side is part of this commitment,” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. “Ensuring equity, the environment and the communities we serve are at the heart of our ‘Charging Forward’ Plan and we look forward to expanding the benefits of all-electric buses, especially to those communities that are disproportionately affected by air pollution, which are often those with low-income and minority populations.” The #63 route, which serves riders from Woodlawn to Chrysler Village, is now the second bus route to feature all-electric buses and is the first electric bus route out of the CTA’s 74th Street Garage, which is located in Chicago’s South Side. The CTA has prioritized equipping garages that serve neighborhoods with the highest air pollution levels, to best serve the communities in areas with disproportionately higher health vulnerability risks. In preparation for rolling out service along the #63 route, all bus operators based out of the 74th Street Garage received training on the specific features and systems of the new electric buses and how to operate them. The #63 route, which operates between 63rd/Stony Island and Midway, is one of CTA’s more heavily traveled bus routes, providing more than 2.4 million rides in 2022. CTA currently has 25 electric buses in its fleet and three of its seven existing bus garages are now equipped with charging facilities for electric buses, with plans to purchase additional vehicles and expand to additional routes and garages in the coming years. Since unveiling the “Charging Forward Plan” last year, CTA has received $29 million in grant funds from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to be used towards the purchase of fully accessible, all-electric buses, as well as bus facility communication and safety improvements to accommodate the new vehicles. Building upon a decade of leading an industry shift toward bus electrification, the CTA unveiled “Charging Forward: CTA Bus Electrification Planning Report” in February 2022 as a blueprint for the agency’s route to a full electric bus fleet and bus operational infrastructure over the next 18 years. Converting a bus fleet of more than 1,800 vehicles is a complex undertaking and will require new buses as well as charging station infrastructure and significant electrical power upgrades. The first of the CTA’s Proterra 600-Series, began running on the #66 Chicago route. Roll-out of these buses along the #66 route was the first step in a larger plan to electrify all bus service along Chicago Avenue. To accommodate the electric buses, the CTA added en-route chargers at Navy Pier, with plans to add more chargers as electric buses are added to additional routes. ",South Side,0.0
CTA announces finalists for Red Line Extension construction bids,"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) continues to advance the transformational Red Line Extension (RLE) project with the announcement that it has selected three pre-qualified teams to submit proposals on the transformative project to extend rail service to Chicago’s Far South Side. Originally promised by then Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1969, the Red Line Extension will look to extend the CTA Red Line past 95th St all the way down to the city’s southern border near 130th St., With work underway on the design, the $3.6 billion project will add another 5.6 miles of heavy rail and connect the Far South Side communities with 4 new stations.

Carter, Jr. “This historic project represents equity for the underserved South Side community by finally giving them a rail line that extends to the city limits.” In October of 2022, CTA issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) asking firms to submit their qualifications. After considering a pool of potential candidates, CTA selected the most qualified teams that have demonstrated the ability to design and build the rail extension. The three entities selected are: FH Paschen, Ragnar Benson, Milhouse and BOWA Joint Venture; Kiewit Infrastructure; and Walsh VINCI Transit Community Partners. These entities are representative of a variety of local, national and international businesses. This selected pool of candidates will move into the next phase of the competitive procurement process and CTA will decide which contracting team will ultimately be chosen to design and build the RLE project based on their submitted proposals. Project proposals will be due early 2024 with an expected execution by the end of 2024. The contracting teams’ proposals will be considered on a variety of criteria, including experience, price, diversity outreach plans, and other factors. CTA expects major construction of this project to begin in late 2025 and is dependent on securing full project funding. ",South Side,0.0
City Council approves Galleria 89,"The Chicago City Council has approved a mixed-use development dubbed Galleria 89. Located at the corner of E. 89th St and S. Commercial Ave, the project at 8854 S. Commercial was the chosen winner of the South Chicago Invest South/West RFP. The proposal is being developed by 548 Capital and Syzygy Cities. Designed by Rivetna Architects and Farr Associates, the development will see the construction of a new five-story, mixed-use building. Set to rise 76 feet tall, the building will have 46 affordable apartments with two commercial retail spaces along S. Commercial Ave. 12 parking spaces will be located along the alley. Residents will enter the building from the shared courtyard between the new construction and the adjacent existing building to the north that is also part of the development.  The massing of the building holds the corner of the site at the intersection while stepping back from the courtyard into a U-shape to minimize the shading of the courtyard. The facade is made up of a three-story masonry base topped by aluminum paneling on the upper two floors. The deep facade creates architectural interest while shading the windows.  With the structure set to meet Passive House standards, the building will use 60% less energy than permitted by code, have 40% lower utility bills, use heat pump technology, have quieter units, will be all electric, use induction cooking, and have a low embodied carbon. The building will have healthier interiors and include a rooftop solar array to help power the building. At 8840 S. Commercial, the development will renovate an existing, three-story, mixed-use building to contain 12 residential units and two ground-floor commercial units. The two retail spaces will face S. Commercial Ave while the residential entry will face the courtyard just like the new construction building. On the ground floor, two loft style apartments will face the back of the site and feature 13-foot ceilings. The upper two floors will have five apartments per floor with 4 out of 5 having balconies.  With a classic Chicago facade, the renovation will restore and maintain the current edifice. New storefront glazing will be added with steel details that celebrate the steel town history of the area. Glass garage doors will be added into the brick wall facing the courtyard for the future retail tenants to have access to the outdoor space. As mentioned, the development leaves a space in between the existing building and new construction to create a courtyard. This area gives access to the residential lobbies while giving a space for the community to gather.  With the Chicago City Council approving the project, the site will be rezoned from B3-2 to B3-3 with an overall Planned Development designation. The project is set to be funded by LIHTC equity and all of the units will be affordable at or below 60% AMI. With zoning entitlements in hand, the developers can move forward with securing funding and permits before beginning construction. A timeline for completion has not been announced. ",South Side,1.0

Transit TIF approved for Red Line Extension,"The Community Development Commission has approved plans for a Transit TIF to support the funding of the Red Line Extension. Originally promised by then Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1969, the Red Line Extension will look to extend the CTA Red Line past 95th St all the way down to the city’s southern border near 130th St.  With work underway on the design, the $3.6 billion project will add another 5.6 miles of heavy rail and connect the Far South Side communities with 4 new stations. The tracks will be elevated from the 95th St station down through 119th where it will transition to grade-level tracks running down to its new terminus at 130th St. With four new stations, the Red Line will begin stopping at 103rd and Eggleston, 111th and Eggleston, Michigan Ave near 116th, and 130th St near Altgeld Gardens.   Transit stations will be connected to the surrounding communities with bus connections, bike and pedestrian linkages, and with Park and Ride facilities. The project also includes a train storage yard and maintenance shop facility, located along the new tracks near 120th St.  With equity at its core, The Red Line Extension will help those in the Far South communities gain access to new resources both inside and outside of their neighborhoods. For those traveling to the Loop from the area around 130th St, taking the Red Line extension will cut off 30 minutes from their commute. While stimulating new economic development for these areas, the plan will also align with the city’s climate initiatives, creating a new option for residents that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and helps with the climate change mitigation effort. The CTA has been working with DPD on an eTOD study to look into how economic development will be spurred in these areas with the new stations. An implementation roadmap is targeted for a presentation in front of the Chicago Plan Commission either late this year or early 2023. With more progress made in the last few years than over the last decade, the project’s recent history began with a non-binding referendum back in 2004 which showed local support for the project. In 2006, the CTA analyzed alternative alignments and formally selected the Union Pacific route as the locally preferred alternative in 2009. The draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was published in 2016, with the preferred track alignment selected in 2018. Late 2020 saw the entering into the project development phase as part of the Federal New Starts funding program and the CTA is wrapping up that portion of the timeline.  Now in 2022, the final Environmental Impact Statement was published, and the project team has reached 30% design completion. The CTA will launch an RFQ for major design-build contractors later this month and kick off a more than year-long engineering phase for the project. During this time, they will actively work on securing the final federal funding to achieve a full financing package. With this engineering and financing phase targeted to wrap up in mid-2024, the CTA will look to award construction contracts in late 2024 and begin construction in 2025. The new Red Line Extension is targeted for a 2029 completion.  As part of the $3.6 billion price tag, the CTA needs to contribute a “local match” to secure the federal funding through the Federal New Starts funding program. The Red Line Extension’s Transit TIF will raise $950 million in increment to provide that necessary local funding. Similar to a traditional TIF district, the Transit TIF allows for the increment raised to more directly benefit transit projects. With a boundary from Madison St to the north and 134th St to the south, the Transit Facility Improvement Area, or TFIA, includes all parcels within a half mile of the Red Line within the north/south extents just mentioned. Within that boundary, the Transit TIF will be a more specific area bound by Madison St to the north and Pershing Rd to the south. This district will make up the parcels whose tax increment will be earmarked for the Red Line Extension. Parcels already in TIF districts will be excluded from the Transit TIF. This distribution means that parcels south of Pershing Rd that are within the TFIA will not be contributing their potential tax increment to funding the project. Representatives from the CTA explained that this decision was made because, while properties north of Pershing Road will generate $950 million over the lifetime of the TIF, properties south of Pershing Rd would only contribute $43 million. The decision was made to not include those areas so that their increment could be used for traditional TIF districts if so desired in the future.  With the Community Development Commission’s approval of the Transit TIF, its next step will be to go before the Chicago Plan Commission this month for a land use review. The CTA plans to garner final approvals from the Finance Committee and full City Council in December 2022. ",South Side,0.0

Caisson permit issued for 400 Lake Shore Drive,"A caisson permit has been issued for the long-awaited residential development at 400 Lake Shore Drive. Planned by Related Midwest, the development which was approved back in the summer of 2020 is located on the former Chicago Spire site. With LR Contracting and BOWA Construction working on the towers, the construction will start with the northern tower. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill with Stantec serving as the architect of record, the 72-story skyscraper will rise 858 feet tall clad in a glass and aluminum window wall with decorative metal accent panels. The project will deliver 635 rental apartments overlooking downtown and Lake Michigan with 300 underground parking spaces serving the building.  As part of the first phase, construction of DuSable Park will begin prior to full occupancy of the building, provided the Chicago Park District provides construction documents for the park within 16 months of issuance of the tower’s caisson permit. Related Midwest is obligated to deliver the completed park in order to receive the final Certificate of Occupancy for Tower One. The riverwalk along the south edge of the site and a new pedestrian lane connecting the riverwalk up to the Ogden Slip will also be completed as part of the initial phase. Imminently, crews will begin below-grade work, including caissons, sheeting, and the cofferdam. Work below-grade is expected to begin in Q1 of 2024 and run through Q2 2025. Once underground work is done, crews will transition to vertical construction, including concrete pours, the building enclosure, and interiors. Above-grade work will start in Q1 2025 and continue through Q2 2027. Landscaping and the final completion of the tower is expected for Q3 2027.  With the overall project approved for 1,100 units, Related Midwest plans to build the 635 units in the northern tower, lease up the building, and then proceed with the construction of the remaining units planned for the southern tower. The second phase will be either condominiums or rentals based on market conditions at that time. ",Streeterville,0.0

Located on the former Chicago Spire site, the development was originally approved back in the summer of 2020, just a matter of months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. With LR Contracting and BOWA Construction working on the towers, the construction will start with the northern tower. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the 72-story skyscraper will rise 858 feet tall clad in a glass and aluminum window wall with decorative metal accent panels. The project will deliver 635 rental apartments overlooking downtown and Lake Michigan with 300 underground parking spaces serving the building.   As part of the first phase, construction of DuSable Park will begin prior to full occupancy of the building, provided the Chicago Park District provides construction documents for the park within 16 months of issuance of the tower’s caisson permit. Related Midwest is obligated to deliver the completed park in order to receive the final Certificate of Occupancy for Tower One. The riverwalk along the south edge of the site and a new pedestrian lane connecting the riverwalk up to the Ogden Slip will also be completed as part of the initial phase. During construction, the majority of truck traffic will use the ramps from the site up to Intermediate Lake Shore Drive. E. North Water St will only be used in isolated cases for oversize load deliveries, such as caisson mobilization, tower crane installation, and hoist installation.  In 45 days, the construction team will be on site to begin site clearing and mobilization. Crews will begin below-grade work, including caissons, sheeting, and the cofferdam. Work below-grade is expected to begin in Q1 of 2024 and run through Q2 2025. Once underground work is done, crews will transition to vertical construction, including concrete pours, the building enclosure, and interiors. Above-grade work will start in Q1 2025 and continue through Q2 2027. Landscaping and the final completion of the tower is expected for Q3 2027.  With the overall project approved for 1,100 units, Related Midwest plans to build the 635 units in the northern tower, lease up the building, and then proceed with the construction of the remaining units planned for the southern tower. The second phase will be either condominiums or rentals based on market conditions at that time. ",Streeterville,0.0
The Saint Grand tops out over Streeterville,"Developers Mavrek Development, GW Properties, Luxury Living, and Double Eagle Development have celebrated the topping out of The Saint Grand in Streeterville. Located at 218 E. Grand, the structure has risen at the northeast corner of N. St. Clair St and E.

Urbanize tours The Saint Grand,"Urbanize recently toured The Saint Grand, a new mixed-use development at 218 E. Grand. Located at the corner of E. Grand Ave and N. St. Clair St, the development is a joint venture between Mavrek Development, GW Properties, Luxury Living, and Double Eagle Development. Designed by NORR, the 21-story tower will comprise of 248 luxury apartments, 45,000 square feet of office space, and 7,500 square feet of ground floor retail space. With the tour led by general contractor Lendlease, we began by working our way up through the building. Heading up to the second and third floors, we walked through the parking garage which will accommodate 106 cars. The space is currently raw and construction netting is enclosing the floors. Working our way up the building, we stopped in the office space on the fourth and fifth floors. Spanning 45,000 square feet, the unique office opportunity presents office tenants with a flagship opportunity in Streeterville. The office space will have a separate bank of elevators from the residential units above. Due to the height of the building, structural cores are not needed around the elevators, and they are currently open to the rest of the floor plate with temporary metal plates infilling the holes in each floor plate. Structural loads are accommodated with the stair cores and reinforced columns.   Moving on to the residential floors, level 6 will be the first residential level. Mechanicals are currently intertwined with pole shores that are in place until the concrete fully cures. The volume of the building sets back at the 6th floor creating space for small private terraces. The apartments on upper floors will have protruding balconies.  Heading up to the top deck, we walked the 9th floor deck which was being prepared for a concrete pour the next day. Crews were laying MEP to be cast in place as well as structural rebar and post-tensioning cables. Goebel Construction is leading the concrete work. Wrapping up on the ground floor, the office lobby will come off of N. St. Clair St and head to the elevator lobby inside the floor plate. 7,500 square feet of retail space will fill out the street frontage on the corner and along E. Grand Ave, with the residential entry at the east end of the street frontage. Crews were finishing up utilities tie-ins near the corner of the building and masonry crews were beginning to enclose the bike room at the back of the building along the alley.  Lendlease began construction in December 2022 with work going vertical this past February. The concrete structure is set to top out in August, with windows beginning in June and wrapping up in October. The first occupancy is set for Spring 2024. ",Streeterville,0.0

Tribune East Tower may still happen,"Almost three years after the tower was originally approved, Tribune East Tower may actually still happen. Approved back in May 2020, the project proposed by CIM Group and Golub & Co was rumored to have been scrapped until now. Located at 421 N. Michigan, developer CIM Group has updated its website with a new bidding opportunity for general contractors. Designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the supertall skyscraper will stand 1,442 feet, just 8 feet shy of Willis Tower’s 1,450 feet. Rising 102 floors, the structure will taper as it rises, clad in a glass curtain wall with gold-colored vertical fins that preserves views of the original Tribune Tower from the Ogden Slip.  The 1.3 million square-foot building has undergone a few revisions in its scope, increasing the hotel from 200 to 250 keys and reducing the parking count from 687 cars down to 426 spaces. The 564 residential units will remain with the same split of 125 condominiums and 439 rentals. As part of the project, the development will include upgrades on site for both Upper and Lower E. Illinois St for residents and hotel guests entering the building. The existing Pioneer Court Plaza along N Michigan Avenue has already been renovated as part of the first phase to create additional green space and outdoor seating. While construction was originally slated to begin back in early 2022, the new information from CIM Group calls for the commencement of construction in February 2024.

Construction begins on FlyOver at Navy Pier,"Construction has begun on the 48,000-square-foot space that will house FlyOver, a new flight ride attraction at Chicago’s historic Navy Pier. With McHugh Construction leading the construction, FlyOver will replace Navy Pier’s longtime IMAX theater, located near the Centennial Wheel on the west end of the pier. McHugh began demolition of the existing space in June 2022 in preparation for building out the 60-foot-high, 80-foot-wide space. “McHugh has an extensive track record of success when it comes to building on Navy Pier, including past projects like the Centennial Wheel; Offshore, the world’s largest rooftop bar, according to the Guinness Book of World Records; and Sable at Navy Pier, a $100 million, 223-room hotel that is part of Hilton’s Curio Collection,” said Andrew Totten, vice president of McHugh Construction. “We were excited to return to Navy Pier and create a new space to enhance the visitor and tourist experience in Chicago.” FlyOver, from global attractions and hospitality company Pursuit, will be the first ride of its kind in Chicago. The experience will be based on similar FlyOver attractions from Pursuit located in Las Vegas, Canada and Iceland. Once completed, the immersive attraction will provide guests with the feeling of flight as they hang suspended from moving seats with their feet dangling below. Exclusive flight ride films projected on a 65-foot wrap-around screen will showcase Chicago as well as iconic landscapes from around the globe as riders enjoy a full multi-sensory experience, complete with mist, wind and scents. Pursuit initially hired McHugh to perform a feasibility study for the demolition of the IMAX Theater as well as the construction of the new attraction. Following the study, Pursuit signed a lease for the space, selected Chicago-based Epstein as the architect, and hired McHugh as the project's construction manager. Set to cost $13 million, the FlyOver project is expected to open in Spring 2024. ",Streeterville,0.0

Funding announced for Northwestern tower expansion,"Northwestern University has announced the receipt of $121 million in a gift from Northwestern University Trustee Kimberly K. Querrey (’22, ’23 P) and the Louis Simpson Trust. Divided amongst a number of initiatives at the Feinberg School of Medicine, $64 million of the gift will support Phase 2 of the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center, located at 303 E. Superior. Designed by Perkins & Will, the facility originally opened on the Chicago campus in June 2019, bringing physicians together with top-ranked clinical affiliates to solve complex biomedical challenges. With funding secured, Phase 2 will build a new 19-story addition that will see the buildout of 15 new lab floors. Once completed, the full buildout will make the building the largest academic biomedical research facility in the world, rising an extra 340 feet over the 258-foot-tall podium. Back when Phase 1 was proposed, the project drew intense criticism for proposing to and then eventually demolishing Bertrand Goldberg’s Prentice Women’s hospital. After a bitter fight that included a failed landmark bid and letters of objection from architects including Frank Gehry and Jeanne Gang, Northwestern proceeded with demolition and the building came down in 2013. The new structure, standing 12 stories for Phase 1, was completed in 2019. With funding in hand, the university will likely look to begin preparation for construction. An official word on the expansion’s timeline has not been announced. Permits have not been filed for the vertical expansion. ",Streeterville,0.0

Real estate firms acquire RUSH Oak Brook Medical Center,"Joint venture partners Remedy Medical Properties and Kayne Anderson Real Estate announced the acquisition of the 93,386-square-foot, LEED Gold-certified RUSH Oak Brook Medical Center in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook.  “As a Chicago-based company, we are thrilled to acquire this trophy building in our home market,” says Joe Magliochetti, chief investment officer for Remedy. “The RUSH Oak Brook Medical Center increases our portfolio in the Chicago market to 2.55 million square feet. In addition, Remedy has an existing relationship with OrthoMidwest, and this was a great opportunity to expand our relationship with one of the best orthopedic groups in the country, as well as one of the leading academic medical centers in RUSH.” The three-story medical office building and ambulatory surgery center (ASC), located at 2011 York Road, sits on 3.516 acres and is 99% long-term leased by RUSH University System for Health, one of the top health systems in the U.S., and Midwest Orthopaedics at RUSH, a division of OrthoMidwest and the top-ranked orthopedic and spine practice in Illinois.  Completed in 2018, RUSH Oak Brook is an orthopedic center of excellence, and also serves as an outpatient healthcare hub for more than 20 other clinical specialties in Chicago’s affluent western suburbs. Services include physical therapy and rehabilitation; neurosurgery; ear, nose and throat; OB/GYN; dermatology; pain management; gastroenterology; and primary care, among others.  The building features a high-volume, Certificate of Need (CON) protected, multi-specialty surgery center featuring six operating rooms, two procedure rooms and 28 patient bays. The facility also boasts more than 65 exam rooms, outpatient surgical suites, an advanced imaging center, and in-house lab services.  “RUSH developed this state-of-the-art property to be their multi-specialty hub in Chicago's west suburbs, as its two acute care hospitals are located further east in Chicago and Oak Park. Surgery center procedure volumes at Oak Brook have outpaced RUSH's original expectations, and outpatient orthopedic surgical volume is expected to increase sharply over the next decade,” says Antonio Minchella, senior managing director, medical office, for Kayne Anderson Real Estate. “The Certificate of Need creates a high barrier to entry for competitors and further ensures the long-term profitability of this facility.” The facility was built to suit in 2018 and features a modern metal and glass curtain wall design, with a covered patient drop-off area and attractive landscaping. Interior details include a two-story atrium main lobby with a dark wood feature wall, ornamental LED lighting and a seating lounge. Architect CannonDesign utilized a “universal grid” modular design strategy to maximize the medical offices for adaptability and long-term value. An attached parking structure offers 492 free valet or self-park spaces and offers direct building access on each floor.  ",Suburbs,0.0

The ground floor would hold commercial space and an outdoor plaza for public use that measures approximately 4,000 square feet.  According to The Record North Shore, to gain approval for the project, Optima would have to submit a pre-application, undergo a Village staff review, file a preliminary application, and eventually go in front of the Appearance Review Commission, Plan Commission and Village Board.

Optima Verdana opens leasing gallery,"Optima, Inc. has announced the opening of its on-site leasing gallery at Optima Verdana, the company’s latest luxury rental community located at 1210 Central Ave in downtown Wilmette. With the building set to welcome its first residents in July, units are already over 30% leased before opening its doors to walk-ins and prospective residents on May 17. Optima Verdana comprises 100 residences split into one-beds, two-beds, three-beds, and penthouses ranging in size from 660 to 2,790 square feet with monthly rents ranging from $2,950 to nearly $12,000. Designed by Optima, the contemporary building is clad in a glass facade and abundant greenery. The building has incorporated the latest sustainable technology and even gets its name from “verdure” - which means lush green vegetation. The building’s structure is made up of a green concrete, the facade uses bird-friendly glass, and the building will achieve a Green Globes 2-Globes certification by using VRF heating and cooling systems, eco-friendly induction cooktops, and outdoor electric grills to further reduce gas emissions.  Optima Verdana will also feature the Chicago-region debut of Optima’s proprietary exterior vertical landscaping system. Pioneered at the firm’s Arizona projects, the self-contained irrigation and drainage system has been modified to suit Chicago’s four-season climate and remain green year-round. In addition to providing residents with a connection to nature, the plantings promote evaporative cooling, re-oxygenate the air, reduce dust and smog levels, decrease ambient noise and detain stormwater. On the interior, two finish packages will distinguish units which all come with floor-to-ceiling windows outfitted with roller shades; 10” luxury plank flooring throughout; chef-inspired kitchens with Fisher & Paykel appliances and Kohler fixtures; custom built-in storage throughout; wine fridges; spacious pantries; and bathrooms with free-standing soaking tubs and separate water closets across most floor plans. Private residential terraces available in most homes range from 65 to 931 square feet in size and include fire pits and quick-heating electric grills in select residences.  Indoor amenities include a 24-hour front door person; pickleball/basketball court; fitness center with cardio and strength-training equipment, plus free weights with complimentary towel service; a yoga room; massage room; golf simulator and sports lounge; kids’ playroom; pet park and spa; library lounge; and multiple work-from-home spaces, including conference rooms and a business center. Fitness programming will include yoga and mindfulness, Pilates, high-intensity interval training classes, water aerobics and personal training. A seventh-floor sky deck, which will open this summer, offers a range of health and wellness amenities including a heated, glass-enclosed lap pool and spa designed for year-round use with retractable glass walls that open onto the sundeck; complimentary pool towel service; a sauna; barbecue grills; two herb gardens; a bocce court; firepits and lounge areas; a party room with chef’s kitchen; residents’ club; and game room.  Located across Green Bay Road from the Wilmette Metra commuter train station, Optima Verdana® is ideally positioned for North Shore commuters, featuring 176 parking spaces, as well as electric vehicle charging stations.

Optima Verdana tops off in Wilmette,"Integrated architecture and real estate development firm Optima, Inc. has announced its construction team has topped off Optima Verdana, a new luxury six-story, 100-unit rental apartment building at 1210 Central in Wilmette. Located across Green Bay Road from the Wilmette Metra commuter train station, Optima Verdana is ideally positioned for North Shore commuters, featuring 176 parking spaces, as well as electric vehicle charging stations. With the concrete structure complete, Optima has installed the glass exterior panels on the first, second and third floors, with façade work continuing to move up the building. Aligning with Optima’s commitment to sustainability and the natural environment, the glass on the first three floors is bird-friendly, featuring a subtle pattern to help birds avoid the glass.  Optima Verdana will feature one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments with an average size of 1,499 square feet to give residents more flex space for ever-changing lifestyles. The boutique building will also feature 8,000 square feet of street-level retail space, as well as a publicly accessible plaza with an original 8-foot sculpture by Optima CEO and co-founder David Hovey Sr., FAIA. “Every detail at Optima Verdana has been carefully curated – from using green concrete in the construction process to the signature vertical landscaping system,” said Hovey. “We are excited to move into the next phase of interior construction and begin pre-leasing this spring, as we’ve experienced unprecedented interest from residents on the North Shore and across the country.” Inspired by the word “verdure” – meaning lush, green vegetation – Optima Verdana marks the Chicago-area debut of the latest evolution of Optima’s signature vertical landscaping system, which was developed in Arizona but modified to accommodate the Midwest’s four seasons. In what will be a first for the developer in the Chicago area, Optima Verdana plants will stay green year-round and be maintained by Optima’s property management team. The self-containing irrigation and drainage system promotes evaporative cooling, re-oxygenates the air, reduces dust and smog levels, decreases ambient noise and detains stormwater. From start to finish, Optima Verdana will embody a 360-degree approach to sustainability. The building is being constructed to achieve two Green Globes through the Green Globes® building certification, an alternative to LEED certification. In addition to being built with green concrete, Optima Verdana adheres to sustainable practices through its highly energy-efficient VRF heating and cooling mechanical system. Optima has also made the bold move of reducing gas emissions by outfitting residences with environmentally friendly and energy-efficient induction cooktops and outdoor electric grills.   The seventh-floor sky deck will offer sweeping views and a range of health and wellness amenities, including a heated, glass-enclosed lap pool designed for year-round use with retractable glass walls that open onto the sundeck; complimentary pool towel service; a spa and sauna; barbecues and herb gardens; bocce court; firepits and lounge areas; a party room with chef’s kitchen; residents’ club; and game room. Indoor amenities will include a pickleball/basketball court; fitness center; a yoga room and massage room; golf simulator and sports lounge; children’s play area; pet park and spa; library lounge; and multiple work-from-home spaces, including conference rooms and a business center.  Pre-leasing will begin in early May with move-ins scheduled floor by floor, starting in July.

Chicago Bears close on Arlington Heights property,"The Chicago Bears have announced that they have closed on the Arlington Heights property that is potentially set to become home to a new stadium and mixed-use destination. After signing an agreement for the purchase of the 326-acre site back in September 2021 and revealing their preliminary master plan back in September 2022, this milestone represents the next step in the process towards building a new stadium.   Paying a cool $197 million, the Bears assured that “finalizing the purchase does not guarantee the land will be developed.” According to team officials, there is “still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible.” Set to become one of the largest megaprojects of the Midwest, the master plan by Hart Howerton includes a multi-purpose entertainment district anchored by a new, best-in-class stadium that would be enclosed. The aspiration would be to have a caliber of facility that could host events such as the Super Bowl, College Football Playoffs and Final Four. ‏The stadium’s entertainment district would be complemented by the creation of a further mixed-use district, offering multi-purpose entertainment venues, commercial/retail spaces, and housing that could provide economic benefit to Cook County and the surrounding areas of Illinois. ‏The team envisions the expansive district to potentially include restaurants, office space, hotels, fitness space, new parks and open spaces, and other public realm improvements.  Team officials claim that “possible construction of a stadium-anchored development is projected by analysts to create more than 48,000 jobs, generate $9.4 billion in economic impact for the Chicagoland economy and provide $3.9 billion in new labor income to workers across the region.” The completed development could create almost 10,000 new permanent jobs and generate $1.4 billion in economic impact for Chicagoland. With all that said, team officials reiterated that they will need financial assistance ""to ensure feasibility, including our securing property tax certainty and support for infrastructure commensurate with the public benefits the project will yield to the region. For the development to move forward, and for this effort to be financially feasible, a public-private partnership addressing predictable taxes and necessary infrastructure funding for public uses is essential.” The official announcement from the team closed by claiming that there has been “no decision that the development of the recently acquired property will occur.” Pending battles with different governmental bodies for the financial assistance they seek and the unknown timeline for the actual project design, a timeline for when the scheme could come to fruition is as clear as mud.

Chicago Bears unveil plans for Arlington Heights property,"The Chicago Bears yesterday released a statement on their plans for a new stadium and mixed-use district at the Arlington Heights property which they signed an agreement for the purchase of back in September 2021. According to the statement released by the team, they remain under contract to purchase the site, but there are still conditions that need to be met before they would be able to close on the property. If they do close, it is not a guarantee that the team will develop it.  While the project is not officially moving forward, the project would be one of the largest development projects in Illinois state history, according to the release. With Hart Howerton on board for the master plan, the vision includes a multi-purpose entertainment district anchored by a new, best-in-class stadium that would be enclosed. The aspiration would be to have a caliber of facility that could host events such as the Super Bowl, College Football Playoffs and Final Four. ‏The master plan goes on to create a further mixed-use district, offering multi-purpose entertainment venues, commercial/retail spaces, and housing that could provide economic benefit to Cook County and the surrounding areas of Illinois. ‏The team envisions the expansive district to potentially include restaurants, office space, hotels, fitness space, new parks and open spaces, and other public realm improvements.  The team estimated that construction of the plan would create more than 48,000 jobs with a resulting $1.4 billion annual economic impact. Tax revenues are projected at $16 million in annual tax revenue in addition to property taxes for Arlington Heights, $9.8 million for Cook County, and $51.3 million for the State of Illinois. According to the statement, the team would privately finance the stadium construction, but are looking towards the various governmental bodies for supplemental public funding as they build out the rest of the master plan.  ‏‏‎While they cannot discuss or explore any other alternative stadium sites or opportunities while they are under contract, the team reportedly is committed to Soldier Field and will honor the terms of its lease. This means they cannot respond to Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s recent proposals for a dome over Soldier Field or other improvements. There is much more work to be done before the Bears may say goodbye to Soldier Field in favor of a suburban, mixed-use district with a new, enclosed stadium. Once they close on the property, then they will decide whether to develop on it and what that timeline may look like.  The team is hosting a community meeting this Thursday, September 8th for an informational discussion about the potential purchase and redevelopment. The meeting will take place 7-9 pm at John Hersey High School's gymnasium (1900 E Thomas St, Arlington Heights). School parking lots are scheduled to open at 5 pm and doors open at 5:30 pm. Guests will not be allowed on campus prior to 5 pm. Attendees will be admitted first come, first served until capacity is reached. ",Suburbs,0.0

Chicago Bears ink deal to purchase Arlington Racecourse,"The prospect of the Chicago Bears leaving their longtime home at Soldier Field and building a new stadium in suburban Arlington Heights just became a little more real: The team signed a purchase and sale agreement for the 326-acre Arlington International Racecourse property. News of the deal—which still hasn't closed—was first reported by The Athletic and later confirmed by the Bears, Arlington Racecourse owner Churchill Downs, and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. It comes roughly two months after the Bears submitted a bid to purchase the sprawling northwest suburban site. ""We are excited to have executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) for the Arlington Park property,"" Bears president and CEO Ted Phillips said in a statement Wednesday. ""We are grateful to Churchill Downs Incorporated for their efforts to reach this point...  Finalizing the PSA was the critical next step in continuing our exploration of the property and its potential."" The team's dissatisfaction with Soldier Field and its Chicago Park District owners boils down to money. The stadium is geographically landlocked and one of the smallest capacity venues in the league. It doesn't offer the team revenue-generating perks such as a nearby entertainment district, on-site sports betting, or the option for a stadium naming rights deal. The team's lease with the city runs through 2033, but the Bears could theoretically break the agreement as early as 2026 and pay an $84 million penalty.  A spokesperson for the mayor's office said in a statement that City Hall was ""not surprised"" by the Arlington purchase agreement but will remain ""committed to continuing the work to keep the team in Chicago"" and are open to further discussions. ""My statement still stands on the Bears: my admin remains committed to continuing the work to keep the team in Chicago, "" Mayor Lightfoot tweeted late Tuesday evening. ""As I have said numerous times, our door in City Hall remains open.""  If the Bears go through with the move, it could also threaten the viability of the massive One Central real estate development proposed for the air rights above the rail tracks just west of Soldier Field. One Central developer Bob Dunn redeveloped land adjacent to stadiums for the Detroit Lions, Minnesota Vikings, and Green Bay Packers and is likely expecting the Bears to stay put. Conversely, if One Central is approved and built, the megaproject could potentially partner with the Bears and provide the year-round entertainment district and sportsbook the team appears to need so badly.  On September 25, Arlington Racecourse held what was likely to be its last horse races. The suburban location benefits from a Metra stop but is still some 25 miles northwest of the current stadium. The venue opened in the late 1920s, and its impressive main grandstand was designed by architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merril in the 1980s.

DPI HQ presents final design to Plan Commission,"The Chicago Plan Commission was presented the final design for the Discovery Partners Institute’s new headquarters at the 78 as the development looks to get final site plan approval. Located on a one-acre parcel, the project will anchor the south end of the 78, fronting the future intersection of W.15th St and S. Wells St, also known as the Wells-Wentworth Connector. The project, addressed as 1519 S. Wells, is being overseen by the Illinois Capital Development Board since the project is being funded by the state. With OMA as the design architect and Jacobs as the architect of record, the project will take the form of an eight-story building that will encompass approximately 213,000 square feet of space. Rising 136 feet, the building will house classrooms, meeting and event spaces, labs and offices for research, development and startups, as well as collaboration space interspersed throughout the building.  With programming driving the design, the building’s program was stacked into efficient volumes and then enclosed with a unified form. Derived from the multidirectionality of the site, the rounded forms seek to not privilege any direction, creating a democratic form that orients itself to all of its surroundings.  Each floor inside the building is split into three neighborhoods. The northern neighborhood will be the innovation neighborhood, home to computational labs and offices. At the south end, the experimental neighborhood will include experimental labs and workstations. The center of the building is home to the instructional neighborhood, which hosts classrooms as well as the building core to the east side.  The center of the building will be home to an atrium that is positioned as an active collision zone within a network of flexible collaboration zones interspersed throughout the building. Floating meeting rooms and connecting stairs will enliven the atrium with opportunities for users to interact and collaborate. The larger network of circulation and interaction zones includes perimeter-facing circulation that includes stairs with smaller flexible workspaces for those who want quieter spaces. The ground floor has been designed to be very open and public, with generous sidewalks and entry plazas for accessing the building. On the interior, a cafe will be open to the public, with multipurpose rooms available for programming and potential community meetings. A 100-person auditorium and the open floor plan will also allow for larger events, including potential career fairs.  For sustainability, the building will meet LEED Gold while also implementing bird protection, construction waste diversion, and workforce development. There will be no on-site parking for cars, but bike parking will be included with showers and changing rooms. With this courtesy presentation taken care, the development is making its way to a final site plan approval before construction can begin. As the first building set to begin construction in 2024, the rest of The 78 will follow at an undetermined timeline under the control of Related Midwest. ",The 78,0.0

On the interior, a cafe will be open to the public, with multipurpose rooms available for programming and potential community meetings. A 100-person auditorium and the open floor plan will also allow for larger events, including potential career fairs.  The discussion opened with Juan Moreno, who asked the team what transpired between the announcement of them winning the project and now, considering the major design change. A representative from the Discovery Partners Institute stated that the process included the rightsizing of the building square footage considering the project’s budget. During their presentation, the architect from OMA showed how they began with a more stacked and stepped design for the program, which has been converted to the efficient vertical stacks in the current design.  Juan Moreno also commented that he appreciated the democratic space comment and the notion that it is a project for all. However, Moreno felt that, considering the building’s relationship to all the unique parts of the city around it, the uniform shape is potentially missing opportunities to tailor the design to its context. The architects responded that his comment is well taken, and they took the approach to be democratic, but a different approach could be to tailor the facades based on their orientation and directly address the surrounding context. Philip Enquist commended the team on a beautiful project and echoed Juan Moreno’s comment by saying that the surroundings are not the same in all directions, so each side is a different experience. Enquist added comments about the ground floor, mentioning that the cafe should face the Wells-Wentworth Connector and wondered why the auditorium and multipurpose rooms are closed instead of more open. Enquist’s last comment was a suggestion that the atrium collision zone should be more connected to the river by pulling it to the west facade, making it visible from the Wells-Wentworth Connector and the river.  The architects responded that some of these comments echo similar comments from DPD and they continue to study the ground floor in particular. Currently, the design is looking to orient activity towards the future W. 15th St where the sidewalk will connect people to the river. They also acknowledged that creating visibility between the street and the collision zone was a fair point.  Philip Enquist jumped back in with the final comment of the session, asking the team what their energy strategy was for the project. Since the team is dealing with budgetary constraints, the architects said they are looking at a fairly typical mechanical system while working to optimize performance through shading the building on the south and west facades, as well as working to meet LEED Gold.   With committee input, the project is moving forward with its final design. Groundbreaking is anticipated for 2024. ",The 78,0.0
Final design revealed for Discovery Partners HQ,"Announced by Governor JB Pritzker and the University of Illinois System’s Discovery Partners Institute, the final design for the Discovery Partners Institute headquarters has been revealed. Planned for a one-acre portion of The 78, the complex will be sited on the south end towards Chinatown. With architecture firms OMA and Jacobs collaborating on the design, the new building will provide more than 200,000 square feet of office, classroom, lab, and event space for DPI and its university and industry partners. The Illinois Capital Development Board oversees design and construction. The eight-story building has been designed to connect with its surroundings, exhibiting a multi-directional form that is impartial to any one specific direction. Engaged with the surrounding buildings, riverfront, and future phases of the Innovation District at The 78, the building’s base will hold a cafe, auditorium, and multi-purpose exhibition space. The building’s main entry will be located at 15th Street and Wells-Wentworth, with a Richard Hunt sculpture anchoring the site landscape. Upper floors will include classrooms, experimental labs, computational labs, and a terrace on the top floor. “DPI cultivates opportunities for research, learning, and innovation to diverse communities, requiring an architecture that adapts to continued growth of its programs. We wanted to provide a building that fosters interdisciplinary interaction and experimentation,” said Shohei Shigematsu, OMA Partner. “Programs are organized to maximize efficiency and potential to converge, and variegated layouts are configured around a central zone of collisions. A soft, transparent form and public ground floor offer an open invitation for the community to the building and its network.” As part of the University of Illinois system, The State of Illinois has provided $500 million in capital funding to launch DPI and establish its Innovation Network at regional universities throughout the state. Related Midwest, the developer of The 78, donated the land for DPI and will oversee the continued buildout of the 62-acre property. The project is expected to break ground in 2024, becoming the first building to begin construction in The 78 Innovation District. It will mark the beginning of a transformation that will connect the South Loop and Chinatown, filling a 62-acre void that has long separated them. ",The 78,0.0

The new bridge replaces one from 1930 and was completed six days ahead of schedule, according to Claffey. Construction on the second bridge will begin later this year.  The new north-south roadway features new lighting and a tree-lined double parkway designed to safely separate cyclists, pedestrians, and car traffic. The street uses raised speed tables (essentially flattened speed bumps) to discourage speeding. When the Wells-Wentworth Connector opens to traffic in 2022, it will not only provide a vital connection between the Loop and Chinatown, but serve as Main Street for what basically amounts to a whole new neighborhood: a 62-acre mixed-use megadevelopment dubbed The 78. Developed by Related Midwest and master-planned by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the estimated $7 billion project is zoned for up to 13 million square feet of residential and commercial buildings with towers reaches as high as 950 feet. The plan includes 12 acres of open space and a University of Illinois research and innovation center known as the Discovery Partners Institute. A public riverwalk at the 78 will eventually connect to riverfront paths at planned developments to the north, such as The Reed at Southbank. Construction of the Wells-Wentworth Connector is supported by $700 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) which the city approved for The 78 in 2019. The funds will also be used to complete other infrastructure at the site, including work to relocate Metra rail tracks and construct a new CTA Red Line subway station at Clark and 15th streets. The 78 is expected to take 10 to 20 years to fully build out. Related declined to comment on its schedule for breaking ground and completing other phases of the project, and the CTA did not respond to a request for comment regarding its timetable for the new Red Line Station. According to the City of Chicago's website for The 78, Related Midwest is ""studying potential modifications to their design and future plans in response to shifting market conditions prior to proceeding.""    ",The 78,0.0
Developer seeks new path for conversion at 30 N. LaSalle,"With the future of the LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative in question, developers Golub & Company and Corebridge Financial have submitted a zoning application that would allow them to move forward with the adaptive reuse without city funding or an affordable housing requirement. Located at 30 N. LaSalle, the 44-story tower was originally built in 1974 and is only 46% leased with a contiguous 12 vacant floors in the bottom of the tower ready for reuse. While the top 20 floors would remain as office space, the lower set of floors would be converted into 349 apartments. The existing office lobby, Amalgamated Bank retail space, and Starbucks retail space would remain in their current locations, while Einstein Bagels will move to the west side of the Washington St frontage to make space for a new residential lobby. Residents would have access to 100 bike parking spaces and a dog run on the ground floor, as well as coworking space and a party room on the second floor.  Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the exterior of the building would be largely the same, except for the installation of new windows at the residential units. At the 11th floor, residents would benefit from a new projecting terrace that features a host of indoor/outdoor amenity spaces. The projecting terrace would be complemented with a resident lounge, party room, and fitness center on the interior of the 11th floor. Planning to expand and improve the streetscape, landscape architects Confluence have been tapped for a full redesign of the streetscape around the building. The developers had been asking for $62 million in TIF through the LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative to help pay for the estimated $143 million conversion in exchange for providing 30% of the units as affordable. By rezoning the building from its Planned Development to DC-16, the conversion could happen by-right, or without another zoning change, providing a second path to fruition for the project as Mayor Johnson leaves the series of proposals along LaSalle Street in limbo, awaiting news of whether the funding initiative will move forward or not. This option of doing the project by-right would also mean that the new apartments would not have to comply with the affordable housing requirements that apply to developments that seek a Planned Development designation or rezoning. A timeline for the rezoning and potential construction is unclear, but the developers touted the ability for a quick turnaround when proposed under the LaSalle Street Reimagined program, citing a potential December 2023 start and early 2025 completion, indicating just over a year for construction.

Final landmark recommendation approved for Century & Consumers Buildings,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for the Century and Consumers Buildings, sending the proposed designation to City Hall. With $52 million in federal funds approved to demolish the towers, the GSA is citing security and safety reasons for the Dirksen Courthouse as reasoning to clear this corner of the Loop. As the GSA has been going through the Section 106 process of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the structure at 208-212 S. State was demolished due to its poor condition and the fire escapes on the Century Building were removed. Built in 1915-16, the Century Building at 202 S. State is a strong example of an early 20th century commercial style building which was essentially an early urban mall, with shops on multiple levels where customers would pass through and shop. Designed by Holabird & Roche, the tower is designed with the fundamentals of the Chicago School with technological advancements that allowed for taller buildings with more glass and windows. The tower’s overall slenderness, narrow mullions, and recessed spandrel panels gave a sense of verticality to the building that was accentuated with its white glazed terracotta cladding.  The landmark designation will identify significant features of the Century Building as all exterior elevations including rooflines as well as the first and second floor exterior which exhibits the 1950’s remodel in the International Style. Due to the adjacency to the Dirksen Courthouse and the GSA’s required reuse criteria, the designation would allow for flexibility in allowing building modifications so that a viable reuse could meet all 15 required criteria set forth by the GSA. Built just a few years earlier, the Consumers Building was completed in 1913 by developer Jacob L. Kesner, with Mundie and Jensen as the architects. Located at 220 S. State, the tower was built as a professional office building with extensive retail space on the lower floors. Also built in the commercial style with the tradition of Chicago School, the building’s steel frame is expressed by a more solid grid-like pattern of narrow, vertical piers and horizontal spandrel bands. The building also retains its lavish interior lobby, with carrera marble on the walls and ceilings with classical revival detailing. A marble staircase sits in an alcove while the space is adorned with decorative bronze fixtures.  The landmark designation will identify significant features of the Consumers Building as all exterior elevations including rooflines as well as the main entrance vestibule and elevator lobby. Due to the adjacency to the Dirksen Courthouse and the GSA’s required reuse criteria, the designation would allow for flexibility in allowing building modifications so that a viable reuse could meet all 15 required criteria set forth by the GSA. With the GSA continuing the Section 106 process, a draft Environmental Impact Statement released reported that demolition would have a “negative, moderate effect” while adaptive reuse would have a “beneficial, moderate impact.” The final Record of Decision is expected to be announced in February 2024.  With final landmark recommendation approval from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the proposed designation will head to City Hall to get votes from the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council. If the city approves the landmark status of the buildings, it will tee up a fight with the federal government who can ultimately decide to still demolish the buildings due to the fact that federal power overrules local ordinances.  ",The Loop,0.0
Google releases renderings of Thompson Center redevelopment,"Google today has released new renderings of their planned redevelopment of the Thompson Center. Google has called Chicago home since 2000 and it continues to invest in the city as it emerges as one of the nation’s most diverse and vibrant tech hubs with many of their partners and customers based there.  With the redevelopment being led by The Prime Group and Capri Investment Group, Google plans to honor the postmodern legacy of the building. Working with Jahn, the building’s reimagining will bring it into the 21st century while maintaining its iconic form. The Thompson Center’s signature 17-story, light-filled atrium will remain. Additionally, the covered colonnade at the base of the building will be redesigned to allow for an enhanced ground floor experience, including opportunities for more food and beverage retail and seasonal activations of the plaza. When it opened, the Thompson Center was intended to be a new kind of gathering space for Chicagoans. After all, it’s the only building in the city where six L train lines converge, connecting Chicago’s South, West and North sides. With a new and improved CTA experience, the Thompson Center will continue to serve commuters and will be perfectly positioned to welcome current and future employees from every corner of Chicago. Google hopes the reimagined building will become a thriving community destination for all Chicagoans in a revitalized Loop neighborhood. With a goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, Google plans to run their offices on clean energy with an important first step of making their offices require less energy in the first place. In order to achieve their pledge of creating a LEED Platinum, all-electric building, the building’s facade and internal systems will be completely replaced. The new triple-pane glass exterior will improve both the thermal performance of the building and the comfort of those inside by requiring less energy to heat and cool. Additionally, it will modernize the way the building looks, and maximize natural daylight and views. Outdated heating and cooling equipment will be replaced with high-efficiency systems as well. At the southeast perimeter of the structure, covered terraces along three levels will offer new greenspaces. With more natural light, access to greenspace, and biophilic design elements that borrow from nature, the original design’s ode to transparency and openness will live on.  Construction activity at the site of the Thompson Center is expected to begin soon, starting with fencing going up around the perimeter early next year. The upcoming improvements will take several years to complete and Google plans to share more about their plans in the future, according to a release shared with the media. ",The Loop,0.0
Permit issued to demolish Thompson Center facade,"A permit has been issued to demolish the Thompson Center’s facade and atrium. After renderings of the redevelopment were revealed in December 2021 and Google signed on to acquire the building in June 2022, this permit is the first sign of movement on the reconstruction of the structure at 100 W. Randolph.  Originally designed by Helmut Jahn and completed in 1985, the architect’s namesake firm Jahn will return to the building to facilitate the redesign for Google’s office space. The work will strip the building down to the structure and rebuild it as a high-tech building with the unique atrium and form that is the Thompson Center. The redevelopment will install a new curtain wall to reduce the building’s high mechanical costs and reduce noise in the atrium. Landscaping will be added to stepped terraces within the curved edifice. While initial concept renderings were shared back in 2021, the scope of the redevelopment has been kept under wraps. The original sale agreement had The Prime Group buying the building for $70 million and the state would have bought back approximately ⅓ of the 1.2 million square feet to reoccupy the building, paying $148 million. Remaining space inside the building was considered for more offices or as a hotel.  While permits are underway for the project, final renderings or plans have not been released to show how the redesign has been adjusted since Google announced its plans to enter a build-to-suit lease with The Prime Group which will result in the building being turned over to Google as the eventual occupant and owner. Clark Construction is listed as the general contractor for the $280 million development which is expected to wrap up in 2026. ",The Loop,0.0
Assemble Chicago gains YMCA as anchor tenant,"Assemble Chicago, the winning proposal of the C40 Reinventing Cities competition, has landed the YMCA as an anchor tenant at the base of the mixed-use development. Planned for a city-owned site in The Loop, the project site at 331 S. Plymouth consists of a city-owned parking garage and a series of smaller parcels on the western edge of Pritzker Park. Bound by S. Plymouth Ct and W. Van Buren St, the rectangular parcel also has an alley running through it that will be vacated. Originally announced back in 2021, the proposal is being led by The Community Builders and Studio Gang, with DesignBridge and JAQ collaborating on the design. The winning submission will encompass a net-zero carbon, 20-story mixed-use structure that will replace a vacant parking garage and four city-owned parcels. Housing residential and commercial space, it will provide 207 residential units priced for incomes ranging from 30 percent AMI to 80 percent AMI.  The podium will feature 14,000 square feet of space for the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago, encompassing a half-gymnasium, fitness equipment, a drop-in childcare center, and space for youth programming. Space for a restaurant on the ground floor will also be included and there will be zero parking spaces. Uniting a dynamic public program with integrated, sustainable systems and efficient materials, the proposition will meet the competition’s 10 Challenges for Climate with a site-specific design that provides a new model to simultaneously address the urgent issues of climate change and inequality in cities. The building will utilize solar panels, a rooftop water tank, heat recovery, no fossil fuels for appliances, efficient structure and facade design, a rooftop garden, and a backup generator. The approximately $102 million proposal will also commit $2 million toward Pritzker Park improvements. Upgrades to Pritzker Park will include a spray fountain, community stage, rain garden, extensive landscaping, and restrooms. Details will be finalized through a Chicago Park District-led community engagement process. The developer initially sought to begin work on the $102 million development by the end of 2021, but challenges in landing low-income housing tax credits and other pieces of a planned capital stack have delayed the process. With YMCA secured as a tenant for the commercial space, the development team anticipates securing construction financing by next summer and beginning construction on the project in 2025. According to a report from Crain's, the project still requires City Council approval for the scope of the development and to acquire the city-owned land for a write down of $1. ",The Loop,1.0
Rezoning introduced to nullify plan for 130 N. Franklin,"Alderman Reilly of the 42nd Ward has submitted a rezoning proposal to downzone 130 N. Franklin’s Planned Development designation to a DC-3, nullifying the development’s zoning approval and effectively ending the project. Planned by Tishman Speyer, the tower was supposed to occupy the currently vacant parcel that was once home to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Building. After the initial design was approved in 2015, the Planned Development’s six-year sunset was avoided by receiving a one-year extension that pushed the expiration into 2022. At the end of 2022, the redesign Urbanize reported on would allow the Planned Development to last another year. Local firm Krueck Sexton Partners has been in charge of the project’s design all the way back to the original 2015 scheme, with this latest version looking to update the massing and improve the public realm at street level. With the 730-foot height still intact, the building’s massing was largely simplified, expressed as a rectangular volume clad in flat curtain wall panels.  The tower design featured a dramatic shift at the low-rise portion of the tower, which extends towards the south, creating a trapezoid volume with curved terraces hanging off the building. Going up the tower, terraces continue at every floor on the midrise section, and every other floor on the high-rise section. With the redesign set to expire within a couple months and no progress made towards construction, Alderman Reilly’s rezoning introduction is proactive in responding to the ultimate lapse of the Planned Development. If the zoning passes, the approvals will effectively be canceled and would require a new zoning process if the developer wanted to move forward with the project. ",The Loop,0.0
Merchandise Mart set to get new amenities and rebrand,"With the building rebranded as THE MART, Merchandise Mart is getting a fresh suite of tenant amenities as well as food and beverage retailers and lobby renovations. Owned and operated by Vornado Realty Trust, THE MART is an architectural icon and the largest privately held commercial building in the United States.  Designed by Gensler, the new updates will provide the future of office space to some of the country's most creative and forward-thinking companies. The highly visible transformation will honor and challenge the building's heritage and its existing Art Deco architecture to create an open and accessible meeting place, opening its doors as a marketplace of experiences, creativity, and ideas. With new spaces and amenities set to open this summer, the offerings include a revitalized approach to the South Lobby, one of the city's most iconic Art Deco interiors, that includes the installation of new lounge seating to create a warm and welcoming environment for the public, with furnishings sourced exclusively from design showrooms at THE MART. An extensive, centralized amenity experience on the second floor will feature a 23,000 square-foot health club with state-of-the-art equipment, studios offering a full range of classes, and a juice bar; an intimate tenant-exclusive speakeasy lounge overlooking the river; and a cluster of new curated retail offerings across beauty, health, and wellbeing. A 21,000 square-foot tenant-exclusive conference center and workspace with conference and meeting rooms, lounge areas, flexible programming space, and a private café, designed for quiet focused and productive collaboration will also be part of the new offerings. On the exterior, a reimagination of THE MART's River Park public space will include a plaza for pedestrian traffic and gathering, a lush central lawn for community celebrations and programming, al fresco seating activated by new food and beverage offerings, and a localized approach to landscaping that introduces foliage and perennials from the surrounding Chicago region. Designed by Hoerr Schaudt Landscape Architects, the new River Park is part of a larger approach to make privatized space public by bringing the rooftop amenities to the street level, creating a new front yard for Chicago and one of few dynamic spaces available to the public on the riverfront. The upcoming transformation follows an earlier phase of improvements to THE MART in 2016 that saw the introduction of the Grand Stair and Marshall's Landing, one of Chicago's top dining destinations, and a new Food Hall with robust and varied offerings, as well as a new reception and information desk.

City announces two more LaSalle Reimagined winners,"The City of Chicago has announced the advancement of two additional office-to-residential conversion projects to the next stage of the review process as part of LaSalle Street Reimagined. “As LaSalle Street continues to evolve as one of the most distinguished and storied corridors in the Midwest, these conversions reaffirm the City’s support for innovative projects and improvements that reinforce its economic vitality for all Chicagoans,” Mayor Lightfoot said.  With three proposals originally awarded back in March, the combined five adaptive reuse proposals would, if ultimately approved by the city, represent nearly $1 billion in investment along the corridor. Together the office to residential conversions would result in over 1,600 residential units, with more than 600 of them slated to be affordable. These conversions would also reduce upper-story commercial vacancies along the LaSalle corridor by nearly 50%. Check out below for details on the two latest projects:   30 N. LaSalle Planned by Golub & Company and AIG, the 44-story tower was originally built in 1974 and is only 46% leased with a contiguous 12 vacant floors in the bottom of the tower ready for reuse.  With SCB in charge of the design, the original plan would convert the lower 22 floors into 432 apartments. The revised scope trims the unit count from 432 down to 349, removing a few floors of units and eliminating the previous plan for adding a new elevator in the building. With 349 total units instead of 432, the affordable count of apartments is being cut from 130 down to 105.  Like before, the top 20 floors would remain as office space and a residential lobby will be added along W. Washington St. The existing office lobby, Amalgamated Bank retail space, and Starbucks retail space will remain in their current locations, while Einstein Bagels will move to the west side of the Washington St frontage to make space for the residential lobby. Residents will have access to 100 bike parking spaces and a dog run on the ground floor, as well as coworking space and a party room on the second floor.  The exterior of the building will be largely the same, except for the installation of new windows at the residential units. At the 11th floor, residents will benefit from a new projecting terrace that features a host of indoor/outdoor amenity spaces. The projecting terrace will be complemented with a resident lounge, party room, and fitness center on the interior of the 11th floor. Planning to expand and improve the streetscape, landscape architects Confluence have been tapped for a full redesign of the streetscape around the building. Down in cost from $173 million to $143 million, the developers have reduced their TIF ask from $75 million down to $62 million. The remaining cost will be covered with equity and debt. With empty floors and no landmark status, the development team is ready to start demolition immediately if chosen by the city. Construction would be set to begin in December 2023, with the first units being available at the beginning of 2025. -- The Clark Adams Renewal The second proposal now under consideration is for 105 W. Adams. Known as the Clark & Adams Building, it was designed by the Burnham Brothers and completed in 1927, standing 476 feet tall with 41 floors. Currently in receivership, the building is just 20% occupied and in poor physical condition. Planned by locally based Celadon Partners and Blackwood Group with DesignBridge on board as the architect, the developers plan to convert the building into 247 apartments, with 75% of them designated as affordable at 60% AMI. The 247 units will be split into 104 studios, 81 one-beds, 50 two-beds, and 12 three-beds. Residents will have access to 125 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. With 27,500 square feet of commercial space, the developers are targeting a grocery tenant to fill up the second floor of the building.  Above that, the existing Club Quarters Hotel occupies floors 3 through 10 and would remain unchanged and open as part of this plan. Floors 11 through 23 will be renovated to house the residential units, with the 24th floor set to host amenities for the new residents. With a full exterior and interior restoration planned, the only revision to this proposal is its cost, lowering the pierce tag from $188 million down to $178 million. Funding will include a lower TIF ask, penciling in at $57 million instead of the previous $60 million. The rest will be covered by equity, a first mortgage, City of Chicago capital, donation tax credit equity, and other grants. This project team is currently in discussions with the owner and would finish acquiring the building in July 2023, receive zoning approval by January 2024, begin construction April 2024, and complete the building by December 2025.

Preliminary landmark designation approved for Century & Consumers Buildings,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks yesterday approved a preliminary landmark designation for the Century and Consumers Buildings, but the structures aren’t safe yet. With $52 million in federal funds approved to demolish the towers, the GSA is citing security and safety reasons for the Dirksen Courthouse as reasoning to clear this corner of the Loop. After approving a resolution to formally review the buildings in July 2022, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks heard detailed reports from landmarks staff in September 2022 that the buildings were certainly of landmark status and eligibility. At the time, the commission stopped short of a vote, acknowledging the clearly established criteria for potential landmarking but also acknowledging the need for more time to get more information surrounding the perceived safety issues, so that a designation process would help rehab buildings in a way to provide reasonable and necessary security for the courthouse. Since then, the GSA has been going through the Section 106 process of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to define anticipated environmental impacts and accommodate historic preservation concerns through the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) process.  The GSA has retained architects to conduct condition assessments on all four buildings and draft reports are in the works. According to landmarks staff, they have been informed that the Century and Consumers Buildings appear to be structurally sound but have considerable exterior cladding issues. In between them, the building at 214 S. State appears to be structurally sound, but the structure at 208-212 S. State is in a condition that necessitates demolition. That building’s original 1920’s facade was removed in a 1950’s facade remodel that was then also replaced by a 1990’s remodel. The GSA has blocked the sidewalks off and plans to demolish the structure this month. Additional work on the site includes the removal of the fire escapes on the remaining three buildings and the removal of portions of the terracotta parapets which will be stored in coordination with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) Built in 1915-16, the Century Building at 202 S. State is a strong example of an early 20th century commercial style building which was essentially an early urban mall, with shops on multiple levels where customers would pass through and shop. Designed by Holabird & Roche, the tower is designed with the fundamentals of the Chicago School with technological advancements that allowed for taller buildings with more glass and windows. The tower’s overall slenderness, narrow mullions, and recessed spandrel panels gave a sense of verticality to the building that was accentuated with its white glazed terracotta cladding.  The landmark designation will identify significant features of the Century Building as all exterior elevations including rooflines as well as the first and second floor exterior which exhibits the 1950’s remodel in the International Style. Due to the adjacency to the Dirksen Courthouse and the GSA’s required reuse criteria, the designation would allow for flexibility in allowing building modifications so that a viable reuse could meet all 15 required criteria set forth by the GSA. Built just a few years earlier, the Consumers Building was completed in 1913 by developer Jacob L. Kesner, with Mundie and Jensen as the architects. Located at 220 S. State, the tower was built as a professional office building with extensive retail space on the lower floors. Also built in the commercial style with the tradition of Chicago School, the building’s steel frame is expressed by a more solid grid-like pattern of narrow, vertical piers and horizontal spandrel bands. The building also retains its lavish interior lobby, with Carrera marble on the walls and ceilings with classical revival detailing. A marble staircase sits in an alcove while the space is adorned with decorative bronze fixtures.  The landmark designation will identify significant features of the Consumers Building as all exterior elevations including rooflines as well as the main entrance vestibule and elevator lobby, the lobby staircase to the second floor, and the barrel-vaulted staircase to the basement including marble finishes at walls and ceilings. Due to the adjacency to the Dirksen Courthouse and the GSA’s required reuse criteria, the designation would allow for flexibility in allowing building modifications so that a viable reuse could meet all 15 required criteria set forth by the GSA. With the GSA continuing the Section 106 process throughout the rest of the year, they plan to publish the Draft Environmental Impact Statement this month, with an estimated cost of rehabilitation set to be released in May. After the process progresses through the year, the final Record of Decision will be announced in February 2024. While the city can proceed with landmarking the structures, the federal government can ultimately decide to still demolish the buildings due to the fact that federal power overrules local ordinances.  -- As a refresher, here are the three official options that would be chosen from for the final decision and the list of 15 criteria required to warrant a ‘viable’ reuse. Alternative A: Demolition - GSA is considering the demolition of four buildings at 202, 208, 214, and 220 S. State. Funds appropriated by Congress are only available for demolition, securing the site, and landscaping the site after demolition has been completed.  Alternative B: Viable Adaptive Reuse - The GSA would consider a viable adaptive reuse of the four buildings contingent on meeting a set of restrictions that are necessary to meet the security needs of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. No federal funds are available for rehabilitation, preservation, or restoration of the buildings. The 15 criteria are as follows: Alternative C: No Action - GSA would continue with the status quo, leaving the buildings vacant with significant repairs needed. Limited federal funding would be available for any future maintenance. ",The Loop,0.0
Three proposals win funding for LaSalle Reimagined,"The City of Chicago has announced three finalists to get city funding through the LaSalle Reimagined initiative. ""Today's announcement represents the culmination of months of work by the Mayor's Office to solicit, review, and identify IFP submissions that will reimagine LaSalle Street,"" Mayor Lightfoot said.  According to the city, each finalist meets the IFP’s objectives to revitalize an underperforming historic property, provide 30% of the total housing units at affordable levels, and create neighborhood-oriented building amenities that contribute to a dynamic, mixed-use, downtown environment. There are presently no affordable apartments on or near LaSalle within the Loop.   Planned for 1.6 million square feet of space, the winning developments include:     The Monroe Residences & Hotel at 111 W. Monroe Planned by Prime/Capri Interests, LLC, which is a joint venture of affiliates of The Prime Group, Inc. and Capri Investment Group, the upper floors of the building will be converted into 349 apartments, with a mix of 182 studios, 125 one-beds, and 42 two-beds. 105 of these will be set aside as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. On the ground floor, hotel guests will enter through the historic lobby off of W. Monroe St, with the residential entry located adjacent to the hotel entrance. A new fine dining restaurant is planned for the lobby at the corner of N. LaSalle St and W. Monroe St. 130 parking spaces will be built underground for residents. With Stantec on board for the design, the project will carve out a 60 foot by 70-foot atrium to allow for natural light to reach the new apartments and hotel rooms without altering any street-facing facades. At the middle of the building, two floors will be turned into a world-class spa and fitness center with an indoor pool, golf simulator, and fitness center. The roof level will be reactivated by reopening the original Monroe Club as an amenity for residents and hotel guests. The former mechanical penthouse will become a restaurant, with the outdoor deck including a pool.  Set to cost $180 million, the project would be funded with $18 million in sponsor equity, $40 million in TIF funding, $14 million LIHTC equity, $20 million historic tax credits, and $88 million in tax-exempt housing bonds. The team could begin construction in 12 months, with a 26-month construction timeline. First units would become available in early 2026, with full occupancy set for Summer 2026. A separate, 226-key hotel project would proceed simultaneously within the building’s lower floors.   -- The Field Building at 135 S. LaSalle  Proposed by Riverside Investment and Development and AmTrustRE, the project would convert 750,000 square feet of empty space into 430 residential units, split into 254 studios, 116 one-beds, and 60 two-beds. With 30%, or 129, of them set aside as affordable, the residential component would be complemented by 80,000 square feet of retail space at the base of the building.  On the ground floor, residential lobbies will be located at S. LaSalle St and S. Clark St, north of the historic main arcade, with retail space occupying the south side of the building fronting W. Adams St. The development team is targeting a grocery tenant to take about 15,000-25,000 square feet of the retail space. Above the retail space, floors three and four would hold 180 parking spaces hidden by new interior walls setback from the exterior windows.  With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board as the architect, the building will receive a full restoration of the facade, restoration of the arcades at the base of the building, and windows will be replaced. Vinci Hamp Architects will be consulting on the historic portions of the redesign.  Set to cost $258 million, the project would be funded with $115 million in TIF, $34 million in Historic Tax Credits, $30 million from a sponsor/3rd party, and $78 million in debt. With the proposal moving forward, design would take 9-12 months, then construction would begin in 2024, with the building opening to residents in Q1 2025. -- The LaSalle Residences at 208 S. LaSalle Planned by The Prime Group, the proposal will convert the middle chunk of floors into 280 residential units. With Lamar Johnson Collaborative and Lucien LaGrange Studio working on the project, floors 13 through 17 will be the ones renovated as part of this proposal. Set to produce 280 apartments, 30% of them will be set aside as affordable. The mix includes 111 studios, 120 one-beds, and 49 two-beds. On the ground floor, residents will enter through a lobby facing S. LaSalle St, sharing with the new hotel. A dog run and dog spa will be included, with a bike storage room also included.  Originally acquired in 1996, The Prime Group has already converted the lower 12 floors into a JW Marriott Hotel and just opened floors 18-22 as The LaSalle Hotel with 232 keys. The building was Burnham’s last design before he died, built in 1914 for the Continental and Commercial National Bank. Set to cost $130 million, the rehab would be funded by $74 million in tax-exempt housing bonds, $10 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits, $33 million in TIF funding, and just $13 million in sponsor equity. Since The Prime Group already owns the building, they would look to start construction by the end of 2023. With W.E. O’Neil on board for construction, the team expects an 18–20-month construction timeline, with first units set to open Summer 2025. -- The nine proposals were evaluated for alignment with the IFP goals, potential catalytic impact and economic feasibility, among other criteria, including efforts to exceed minimum diversity requirements for construction teams.   The selected finalists will proceed to the next phase of the City's standard review, underwriting, and approval processes, including evaluations by the Community Development Commission, Commission on Chicago Landmarks and City Council. TIF requests are tentative until approved by the City Council.   Given the IFP’s success and stakeholder interest in a more equitable and resilient downtown, DPD and DOH are making additional LaSalle Central TIF funding available for adaptive reuse projects that provide 30% housing affordability at an average 60% AMI, offer new neighborhood-oriented public amenities, and exceed City minimums for minority and women-owned participation, among other requirements.   ",The Loop,1.0
LaSalle Reimagined: 105 W. Adams,"With six finalists for the LaSalle Reimagined presenting their plans to the community, Urbanize is breaking it down by proposal to highlight the design and benefits of each one as the city considers which three to name as winners.  Plagued with vacancies, the corridor is littered with empty historic office buildings that no longer meet the current market demands of new office tenants. Originally announced at the end of September 2022, Mayor Lightfoot and the Department of Planning and Development are offering city funding for proposals along the LaSalle Street corridor. Public resources are expected to include federal tax credits, Cook County property tax incentives, TIF funding, PACE financing, Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tools. With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. The final building under consideration is unique in that it has two developers vying for the chance to redevelop it. Located at 105 W. Adams, the Clark & Adams Building was designed by the Burnham Brothers and completed in 1927, standing 476 feet tall with 41 floors. Currently in receivership, the building is just 20% occupied and in poor physical condition.   The Clark Adams Renewal The first proposal comes from the partnership of locally-based Celadon Partners and Blackwood Group. With DesignBridge on board as the architect, the developers plan to convert the building into 247 apartments, with 75% of them designated as affordable at 60% AMI. The 247 units will be split into 104 studios, 81 one-beds, 50 two-beds, and 12 three-beds. Residents will have access to 125 bike parking spaces on the ground floor. With 27,500 square feet of commercial space, the developers are targeting a grocery tenant to fill up the second floor of the building.  Above that, the existing Club Quarters Hotel occupies floors 3 through 10 and would remain unchanged and open as part of this plan. Floors 11 through 23 will be renovated to house the residential units, with the 24th floor set to host amenities for the new residents. With a full exterior and interior restoration planned, the project cost is expected to total $188 million. Funding will include $77.7 million in tax credit equity, $25 million from a first mortgage, $60 million in TIF, $15 million from City of Chicago capital, $8 million donation tax credit equity, $1 million in other grants, and just $900,000 in owner equity. This project team is currently in discussions with the owner and would finish acquiring the building in July 2023, receive zoning approval by January 2024, begin construction April 2024, and complete the building by December 2025. -- 105 W. Adams - Maven The second proposal comes from Maven Development Group who would be collaborating with 5T Management, 33 Realty, and Cogent Management Group on the project. Their proposal would convert 333,000 square feet of space in the building into 423 apartments, with 127 of them set aside as affordable at 60% AMI. The available commercial space on the second floor would be targeted for a grocery tenant as well as other smaller food establishments and retailers on the ground floor. With FitzGerald in charge of the design, the unit mix will consist of 46 affordable studios, 50 affordable one-beds, 31 affordable two-beds, 107 market-rate studios, 117 market-rate one-beds, and 72 market-rate two-beds. The 24th floor would be designed as an amenity floor for tenants with outdoor space being located on the roofs of the lower floors. Set to cost $167 million, the project would be funded with $19.2 million in equity, $18.2 million in historic tax credit equity, $14.5 million in a federal bridge loan, $64.7 million from a construction loan, and $65 million in TIF funding. If selected, the developer will close on the acquisition of the building in the coming months and go through a full Planned Development process with the city. With W.E. O’Neil and GMA Construction Group on board, work would begin Late 2024 and is targeted for completion in 2026. -- The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing. Once that decision is made by the end of month, the city will go through an underwriting process that will take a few months. The proposals will then need approval from the Community Development Commission and City Council for the appropriation of the city funding.  ",The Loop,1.0
LaSalle Reimagined: 135 S.

Public resources are expected to include federal tax credits, Cook County property tax incentives, TIF funding, PACE financing, Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tools. With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. Located at 135 S. LaSalle, the Field Building is set to be converted into a new mixed-use hub along the corridor. Proposed by Riverside Investment and Development and AmTrustRE, the 1934 tower currently holds 1.2 million square feet and is a city landmark. With the departure of Bank of America in 2020, the building has 900,000 square feet of empty space ready to be repurposed. With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board as the architect, the building will receive a full restoration of the facade, restoration of the arcades at the base of the building, and windows will be replaced. Vinci Hamp Architects will be consulting on the historic portions of the redesign.  The planned rehab is limited to floors 15 and below, which will be reactivated with 430 residential units and 80,000 square feet of retail space on the first two floors. New residential lobbies will be located at S. LaSalle St and S. Clark St, north of the historic main arcade that runs through the ground floor. The beginning of the retail space will be on the south side of the arcade fronting W. Adams St. The second floor spans 30,000 square feet and was vacated by Bank of America, offering a large space that could become an event space or could house a potential grocer. The original banking hall space has unique features including 16-foot ceilings and a 7,000 square foot area of column-free space. Teaming up with Bluestar Properties for the retail programming, the development team is targeting a grocery tenant to take about 15,000-25,000 square feet of the retail space.  Above the retail space, floors three and four would be converted into 180 parking spaces. With plans to set the spaces back from the windows with walls to hide the cars from the public view, these spaces are deemed vital to the leasing efforts of the retail space especially for attracting a grocery tenant. These parking spaces would be shared with residents, who would also have access to 400+ bike parking spaces. On the residential floors, the original building's layout is no longer conducive to office use but is very well suited to a residential layout. Measuring 40,000 square feet, the floor plate’s quadrant layout allows for an abundance of light and air even in the urban core. These floors will hold 254 studios, 116 one-beds, and 60 two-beds, with 30%, or 129, of them set aside as affordable. Set to cost $258 million, the project would be funded with $115 million in TIF, $34 million in Historic Tax Credits, $30 million from a sponsor/3rd party, and $78 million in debt. With no leasing encumbrances, this is a shovel-ready project. If selected, design would take 9-12 months, then construction would begin in 2024, with the building opening to residents in Q1 2025. The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing. Once that decision is made by the end of month, the city will go through an underwriting process that will take a few months. The proposals will then need approval from the Community Development Commission and City Council for the appropriation of the city funding.  ",The Loop,1.0

With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. Proposed at 111 W. Monroe, The Monroe Residences and Hotel would create a mixed-use building in the heart of the LaSalle Street corridor. Planned by Prime/Capri Interests, LLC, which is a joint venture of affiliates of The Prime Group, Inc. and Capri Investment Group, the team acquired the building from BMO last summer. Consisting of three towers, the proposal will rehab two of them, with the third tower at 115 S. LaSalle set to hold the state workers moved from the Thompson Center, another development from Prime/Capri Interests, LLC. With Stantec on board for the design, the building will be converted into a mixed-use building, set to include 349 apartments, 226 hotel keys, and meeting/event space on the second floor. The roof level will be reactivated by reopening the original Monroe Club as an amenity for residents and hotel guests. The former mechanical penthouse will become a restaurant, with the outdoor deck including a pool.  To allow for natural light to reach the new apartments and hotel rooms, the plan would carve out a 60 foot by 70-foot atrium inside the building to avoid altering any street-facing facades. At the middle of the building, two floors will be turned into a world-class spa and fitness center with an indoor pool, golf simulator, and fitness center.  Set to build 349 apartments, the units will be a mix of 182 studios, 125 one-beds, and 42 two-beds. 105 of these will be set aside as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. On the ground floor, hotel guests will enter through the historic lobby off of W. Monroe St, with the residential entry located adjacent to the hotel entrance. A new fine dining restaurant is planned for the lobby at the corner of N. LaSalle St and W. Monroe St. 130 parking spaces will be built underground for residents. Set to cost $295 million, the proposal would be funded with $48 million in sponsor equity, $40 million in TIF funding, $14 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits, $35 million in Historic Tax Credits, $20 million in PACE Energy Bonds, $88 million in tax-exempt housing bonds, and $50 million from a senior construction loan.  With the building already under the ownership of Prime/Capri Interests, LLC, the team would be in a position to move forward immediately if selected. BMO has largely moved out of the building already, with only a few floors still occupied that are set to vacate soon, leaving the building free and clear of tenants. The team could begin construction in 12 months, with a 26-month construction timeline. First units would become available in early 2026, with full occupancy set for Summer 2026. The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing.

With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. Today we’re looking at The LaSalle Residences, proposed by The Prime Group. Located within 208 S. LaSalle, the plan calls for converting a middle chunk of floors into 280 residential units. Originally acquired in 1996, The Prime Group has already converted the lower 12 floors into a JW Marriott Hotel and just opened floors 18-22 as The LaSalle Hotel with 232 keys. The building was Burnham’s last design before he died, built in 1914 for the Continental and Commercial National Bank. With Lamar Johnson Collaborative and Lucien LaGrange Studio working on the project, floors 13 through 17 will be the ones renovated as part of this proposal. Set to produce 280 apartments, 30% of them will be set aside as affordable. The mix includes 111 studios, 120 one-beds, and 49 two-beds.  On the ground floor, residents will enter through a lobby facing S. LaSalle St, sharing with the new hotel. A dog run and dog spa will be included, with a bike storage room also included.  Set to cost $130 million, the rehab would be funded by $74 million in tax-exempt housing bonds, $10 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits, $33 million in TIF funding, and just $13 million in sponsor equity.

Public resources are expected to include federal tax credits, Cook County property tax incentives, TIF funding, PACE financing, Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tools. With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. Planned by Golub and Co, the first proposal is at 30 N. LaSalle. Currently in receivership, Corebridge Financial will be getting the title to the building and collaborating with Golub on the project. Originally built in 1974, the 44-story tower is only 46% leased with a contiguous 12 vacant floors in the bottom of the tower ready for reuse.  With SCB in charge of the design, the plan would convert the lower 22 floors into 432 apartments. While 440,000 square feet of space in the bottom of the tower would be converted into residential, the top 20 floors would remain as office space. To allow for the addition of residential use, a residential lobby will be added along W. Washington St. The existing office lobby, Amalgamated Bank retail space, and Starbucks retail space will remain in their current locations, while Einstein Bagels will move to the west side of the Washington St frontage to make space for the residential lobby. With 432 new apartments in the building, units will be split into 252 studios, 126 one-beds, and 54 two-beds. As part of the project, 30%, or 130 of those units, will be set aside as affordable up to 60% AMI. Residents will have access to 100 bike parking spaces and a dog run on the ground floor, as well as coworking space and a party room on the second floor.  The exterior of the building will be largely the same, except for the installation of new windows at the residential units. At the 11th floor, residents will benefit from a new projecting terrace that features a host of indoor/outdoor amenity spaces. The projecting terrace will be complemented with a resident lounge, party room, and fitness center on the interior of the 11th floor.  Planning to expand and improve the streetscape, landscape architects Confluence have been tapped for a full redesign of the streetscape around the building. At the southwest corner of W. Washington St and N. LaSalle St, the streetscape will be redesigned with new landscaping, hardscaping, and public art. Set to cost $173 million, the developers plan to fund the project with $53.6 million in equity, $44 million in debt, and are asking the city to chip in $75 million in TIF funding. With empty floors and no landmark status, the development team is ready to start demolition immediately if chosen by the city. Construction would be set to begin in December 2023, with the first units being available at the beginning of 2025. The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing. Once that decision is made by the end of month, the city will go through an underwriting process that will take a few months. The proposals will then need approval from the Community Development Commission and City Council for the appropriation of the city funding.  ",The Loop,1.0
Lightfoot joins alders to introduce Safe Streets Pilot,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot joined Aldermen Hopkins, La Spata, Martin, Reilly, and Vasquez to introduce to City Council a new measure that aims to improve traffic safety, enhance protections for pedestrians and bicyclists, and speed up public transportation.  The Smart Streets Pilots Ordinance would establish two small-scale pilots downtown that use existing infrastructure and new technology to enforce parking violations, such as cars parked in bike lanes, bus-only lanes, bus stops, and crosswalks, and enable camera enforcement for parking in commercial loading zones.  “As traffic fatalities have risen at an alarming rate both locally and nationally in recent years, it is critically important that Chicago use every tool available to improve safety for all road users,” said Chicago Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot. “That’s why we are proud to introduce an ordinance that will enable two pilots downtown to create safer streets and a better transit experience. By testing a small-scale pilot in 2023, the city will be better able to evaluate how these initiatives will work best when implemented on a citywide scale.”  Traffic fatalities have risen sharply in Chicago and in many other large cities since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Chicago’s annual fatalities in 2021 more than 50% higher than in 2019. In 2021 alone, more than 170 people were killed in traffic crashes in Chicago.  The Smart Streets Ordinance will encourage safer driver behavior and better parking compliance with the goal of reducing crashes and creating safer streets. The ordinance would establish two two-year pilot programs within the boundaries of Lake Michigan to Ashland Avenue and from North Avenue to Roosevelt.  Smart Streets Pilot  This first pilot would authorize the city to ticket registered vehicle owners by mail for various infractions, including parking in bike lanes, bus-only lanes, crosswalks, bus stops, and no parking zones. This pilot would discourage drivers from illegally parking in places that put our most vulnerable road users — people walking, biking, rolling, and taking transit — in dangerous situations, such as forcing bicyclists to merge with motor vehicle traffic.  This pilot would also promote a more reliable, efficient, and accessible bus service by deterring drivers from parking in bus-only lanes or at designated bus stops. Chicago’s growing bus priority network is key to combating congestion, providing equitable rapid transit, and lowering emissions. Free-flowing bus lanes without illegally parked or idling cars will improve rider experience and operational performance of Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Additionally, parked cars at bus stops create challenges and sometimes hazardous conditions for riders with disabilities when buses are blocked from accessing the curb.  The ordinance allows for cameras to be fixed on city poles or on the front of city or CTA vehicles. Once data is collected, it will be individually reviewed and then sent to the Department of Finance (DOF) to be processed. When the city begins camera enforcement of parking or standing violations in areas with posted signs, the ordinance proposes a 30-day warning period for first-time violators, and anyone ticketed within 30 days of the installation of a new camera.  Through the Clear Path Relief program, low-income drivers will continue to be eligible for reduced-priced tickets and other vehicle related debt relief.  Smart Loading Zone Pilot  This second pilot would use license plate reading camera technology to facilitate more efficient driver or company payment and to enforce parking violations within commercial loading zones designed for the loading and unloading of commercial vehicles. The pilot aims to prevent double-parking that puts drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians in unsafe conditions, decrease vehicle idling and reduce emissions, and create a more efficient system for payment and drop-offs for commercial drivers.  The introduction of this ordinance builds on actions by the Lightfoot Administration to keep Chicago’s streets safe through infrastructure investments and design. In 2022, CDOT implemented pedestrian safety improvements at approximately 400 intersections, including bump outs, curb extensions, and refuge islands. CDOT continued to expand and improve Chicago’s bikeway network, adding nearly 40 miles in 2022 and surpassing 100 miles added since Mayor Lightfoot took office. Last year, CDOT began a new program to upgrade all existing plastic-protected lanes to concrete curbs to provide increased safety for all road users.  ",The Loop,0.0
Park District looks to revamp Grant Park framework,"The Chicago Park District opened their community engagement process for the revamp of the Grant Park Framework Plan. Dubbed ‘Chicago’s Front Yard Reimagined’ the effort looks to revisit and update the 2002 Grant Park Framework Plan that is now over 20 years old. Dating back to 1835, Grant Park was originally made to preserve green space from the rapid development occurring in the city. Assembling a large team, the Chicago Park District has brought on UrbanWorks, APMonarch, Confluence, Brush Architects, WSSCG, and Engage Civil. Tasked with creating a comprehensive vision, the new framework plan will outline short- and long-term goals while creating a guide to evaluate future proposals and ideas. This vision will focus on the next 20 years after the previous plan reshaped Grant Park in the last 20 years.  The overall project has four phases. Already complete, the first phase lasted from March until June 2022, working on site verification and program analysis. Currently in Phase 2, this phase is the public engagement portion, beginning back in July 2022 and lasting until July 2023. While public feedback is being received, Phase 3 will begin this month. Lasting until August 2023, this phase will be the design and plan development portion of the project. After Phase 3, the project will be finalized between September 2023 and December 2023, where the final framework plan and report document will be drafted and implemented.  Presenting to the community yesterday, the meeting was the kickoff for the public engagement process of the overall framework plan revamp. While this is the beginning of open public engagement, the Chicago Park District has already been working with a group of stakeholders to identify early priorities. Overall themes from the stakeholder engagement have been preservation and landscape, recreation, events, safety and logistics, and mobility. In the realm of preservation and landscape, common themes include making accessibility accommodations to the park’s historic elements, as well as making accommodations for all of the surrounding residents by adding a playground at the south end of the park and a dog park at the north end of the park.  For recreation, stakeholders have been interested in the park adjusting to current demands by skewing toward pickleball and soccer vs softball, for example. They would like to create more safe and effective spaces to accommodate activities that cater to seniors, while also helping children get involved with public art. Overall, the stakeholders expressed an interest in encouraging visitors of all ages from outside of the immediate area to come to the park.  In regard to events, stakeholders have given suggestions for improvements for events including dedicated staging areas, a system of secondary/service vehicle circulation (including golf carts), infrastructure for temporary stages, and barricade beautification. There have been shared values around minimizing restricted access to the park, keeping the park beautiful during events, “leaving no trace”, and respecting neighboring residents, businesses and institutions. For mobility, there has been the sense that once visitors reach the park, movement is mostly via bikes and walking which can limit access and exploration for certain groups such as families and seniors. Other means of transportation, such as more Divvy stations throughout, people movers, designated golf carts, and free shuttle paths were suggested.   The final theme was safety, where stakeholders brought up the idea that safety and security concerns should not target any specific groups. There was also discussion around the priority that should be given to addressing traffic concerns on Columbus Dr, Lake Shore Drive, and midblock pedestrian crossings at E. Balbo Dr, E. Monroe St, and E. Jackson Dr, with solutions such as speed tables, striped crossings, curb extensions, and limiting the use of those roads. The next steps for the project include three in-person public meetings that will happen this month and into February. After that, the framework will undergo design work before presenting the initial concept design to both stakeholders and another community meeting. After that, the plan will be finalized, presented once again, and finally implemented. ",The Loop,0.0
"Developers propose 2,000 units for LaSalle Street Reimagined","Developers have answered the call for proposals to reimagine the Loop’s LaSalle Street corridor as a new mixed-use district. Plagued with vacancies, the corridor is littered with empty historic office buildings that no longer meet the current market demands of new office tenants. Originally announced at the end of September, Mayor Lightfoot and the Department of Planning and Development identified the bounds of eligible buildings to be those along LaSalle St, stretching from W. Washington St down to W. Van Buren St. While all of these projects would be developed privately, the initiative is offering up an array of public resources to help finance the conversions. Those resources are expected to include federal tax credits, Cook County property tax incentives, Tax Increment Financing, PACE financing, Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tools, subject to the review and approval of relevant public agencies and the Chicago City Council. With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support.   With seven buildings and nine competing proposals, the potential investment lands near $1.2 billion and just over 2,000 units. Here are the proposals broken down by building: 400 S. LaSalle Starting at the south end of the corridor, developer Urban Resolve has proposed to convert the six-story structure into 226 beds of student housing along with a food court, fitness center, and a mental health center. Formerly the CBOE Global Markets headquarters, the $104 million conversion will also include an esports arena. -- 208 S. LaSalle Heading up the block is 208 S. LaSalle, which already had office floors converted into hotels, including a JW Marriott and The LaSalle. Led by The Prime Group, the latest plan would convert a portion of the upper floors into 84 apartments. Set to cost $130 million, the new residences would be served by a dog run, fitness center, lounge, and access to the hotel amenities.  However, a competing proposal has also been submitted for the same space. A cooperation between Sims Property Development & Management and Brinshore Development would create 102 apartments in their $50.2 million proposal. -- 135 S. LaSalle As the former home of Bank of America, Chicago’s Riverside Investment & Development is looking to convert the entire 44-story building into 430 apartments. Set to run $258 million the venture would be a partnership with Blue Star Properties and the building’s owner AmTrust. The base of the building would become home to up to 80,000 square feet of lobby, retail, restaurant, event, and cultural space. This site has been eyed for a potential grocery store, something the area is severely lacking.  -- 105 W. Adams Also known as the Clark-Adams Building, the 1927 tower has been eyed by Maven Development Group for 432 apartments on the upper 31 floors. Spending $167 million, this plan would not include the lower 10 floors which are currently home to a Club Quarters Hotel and Elephant & Castle Pub. Overlooking Federal Plaza to the east, the structure is lucky enough to be one of the two buildings with competing proposals. Coming from Blackwood Group and Celadon Partners, this alternate concept would spend $192 million converting the empty space into 185 units, with a two-level food market and a Stockyards Coffee House at the base.   -- 111 W. Monroe Overlooking the corner of W. Monroe St and S. Clark St, developers Prime Group and Capri Capital Partners are seeking to create 349 apartments with 105 of them set aside as affordable. Previously the headquarters of BMO, the 1974 structure would also see the addition of a hotel on the lower seven floors, plus a spa, rooftop pool, and restaurant all adding up to a $180 million conversion. -- 30 N. LaSalle With the building’s owner AmTrust currently going through a foreclosure suit on the property, developers Golub & Co. and investor American General Life Insurance are looking to convert the 43-story tower into 432 apartments. Set to run them $186 million, the building would have new ground-floor retail space as well as green spaces and seating along its street frontages. -- 170 W. Washington Ending our breakdown at the northern end of the district, this final proposal also happens to be the smallest. Building owners, restaurateurs, and businessmen Scott Cochrane, Kevin Killerman, and Carmen Rossi are looking to convert the building into four apartments with new ground-floor retail and commercial spaces, with them likely including a restaurant of their own. Built in 1930, the plan to convert the five-story building is expected to cost about $2 million. -- With these nine proposals submitted, the city will now review them to determine their feasibility and to decide how much TIF funding, if any, they will allot. Currently, the LaSalle Central TIF district is reported to have $197 million in funds available. The city plans to announce the first winners in a few months and construction could commence as soon as 2024. ",The Loop,1.0
Renderings: New computer science building headed to UIC,"The University of Illinois Chicago is gearing up to begin work on a new 135,000-square-foot computer science building. Known as the Computer Design, Research, and Learning Center or CDRLC, the $117.8 million project will replace a parking lot at 900 W. Taylor Street. The upcoming facility will double the capacity of the school's computer science program and consolidate the department within a single building. The structure calls for 15 classrooms, 35 labs, an auditorium, offices for student affairs, and an undergraduate learning and community center—all connected by a five-story atrium grafted onto the existing Engineering Research Facility at neighboring 842 W. Taylor Street. The new building comes from Seattle's LMN Architects and Chicago-based architect of record Booth Hansen. The design features a ""muscular precast concrete and terra cotta facade,"" which draws inspiration from the school's late modernist eastern campus designed in 1965 by Walter Netsch, according to LMN's website. The project aims to achieve LEED Gold certification and will utilize geothermal technology for both heating and cooling. Construction on the Computer Design, Research, and Learning Center is supported by Gov. Pritzker's Rebuild Illinois capital investment plan. ""As Chicago's only public research university—and one of the most diverse universities in the country—we're making investments to further cement UIC's place as a national leader, propelling it into the future,"" said Pritzker at a groundbreaking event earlier this month. That groundbreaking ceremony, however, was just that—ceremonial. No permits have been issued for the project, and the parking lot where the new building will rise is currently fully intact. According to UIC, the Computer Design Research and Learning Center is expected to open to students in summer 2023. The CDRLC is the third recent addition to UIC's east campus. It follows the Engineering Innovation Building and the Academic and Residential Complex, which both opened in 2019. The university also intends to break ground (at some point) on its $95 million Center of the Arts designed by New York architecture firm OMA and Chicago's KOO LLC. ",University Village,0.0
Next phase of Roosevelt Square will bring 222 apartments to Little Italy,"Chicago developer Related Midwest is preparing to move forward with the next stage of its mixed-income Roosevelt Square project to revitalize 137 acres of mostly vacant Chicago Housing Authority and city-owned land in the Little Italy neighborhood.  The latest phase of the project—known internally as phase 3B—calls for a trio of new-construction mid-rise buildings with a total of 207 apartments, plus 15 units in a rehabbed historic building that will also contain a new home for the National Public Housing Museum. Nearly 100 of the new apartments will be offered at market-rate, while 80 apartments will be reserved for CHA families. The remaining 45 units will be set aside as affordable and workforce housing for residents earning 60 to 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Related also plans to update and modernize an additional 184 existing units located in the first phase of Roosevelt Square during this time. When complete, the Roosevelt Square project will bring more than 2,400 mixed-income units to the former site of the demolished ABLA Homes. ""The key to the redevelopment is replacing isolated public housing buildings with integrated high-quality homes that are available to all members of the community, regardless of income,"" said Related's Michael Kaplan at a virtual community meeting earlier this month. 1237 & 1357 W. Roosevelt Road These ""sister"" buildings will rise six stories and contain 70 apartments each. Designed by architecture firm DesignBridge, the structures will use textured precast and metal panels to create a ""dynamic layering effect"" on their similar (but not identical) exteriors. The lobbies, amenities, and management offices will be located on the ground floor and face Roosevelt Road to bring active uses to the streetfront. A dog park, grilling stations, and 41 parking spaces will be located at the rear of each structure. 1002 S. Racine Avenue Designed by Landon Bone Baker Architects and Moody Nolan, the third new construction building will rise along Taylor Street between Racine Avenue and Lytle Street. Also set to rise six stories, the proposed mid-rise structure features traditional brick cladding on its base and modern panels for its set-back upper levels. New retail space will run the length of Taylor Street and there will be 34 parking spaces available at the rear of the building.  National Public Housing Museum The fourth building of Roosevelt Square's third phase doesn't involve new construction but rather the sole surviving remaining remnant of the demolished Jane Addams Homes. Designed by architect John Holabird in 1938, the masonry structure at the corner of Taylor and Ada streets will be rehabilitated into a long-discussed new home for the National Public Housing Museum. Fifteen mixed-income apartments will occupy the historic building's northern wing.  The soon-to-be repurposed building is located across the street from the Roosevelt Square Library and Taylor Street Apartments. Completed in 2019 during phase 3A of Roosevelt Square, the eight-story structure from Skidmore, Owings & Merrill includes a new Little Italy Chicago Public Library branch topped by 73 mixed-income apartments. This week Related Midwest filed a zoning application for Phase 3B of Roosevelt Square with the city. The proposal will need the support of the Chicago Plan Commission and City Council before construction can begin. If approved, the developer expects to complete the work sometime in 2023. ""This has been a long road to get to where we can build at Roosevelt Square,"" said Related Midwest President Curt Bailey at this month's virtual meeting. ""We are so excited to get started on this important development.""       ",University Village,0.0

Portrait welcomes residents at 948 W. Sunnyside,"Urbanize recently toured Portrait, a new mixed-use development in Uptown that has opened to residents. Located at the corner of N. Sheridan Rd and W. Sunnyside Ave, the five-story building has been developed by Mavrek Development. Designed by NORR, the building will deliver 59 residential units and 7,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. Touring with Mavrek Development and the leasing team from Peak Realty Chicago, we began by walking through the ground floor of the building. Residents enter through the lobby on W. Sunnyside Ave, which opens up to the building’s coworking amenity space that offers residents meeting rooms and space to work from home. Behind the coworking space is a large fitness center as an additional amenity. Heading up to see units, we began with a model unit on the third floor. Offering a mix of studios, junior one-beds, one-beds, and two-bedroom configurations, all of the units have private balconies and designated office nooks designed into each floor plan.  The building had its first move-ins on June 1st and is already 60% leased. Studios start at $1,693/month, junior one-beds begin at $1,816/month, one-beds start at $1,929/month, and two-bedroom units start at $2,940/month. We finished the tour by walking through the surface parking behind the building. With 36 parking spaces provided, the development team enlivened the parking area by having a local artist paint murals on the walls.

Sarah’s on Lakeside breaks ground at 4737 N. Sheridan,"Sarah’s Circle has celebrated the groundbreaking of their latest project, dubbed Sarah’s on Lakeside, located at 4737 N. Sheridan. Set to replace a portion of a surface parking lot, Sarah’s Circle has partnered with Brinshore Development to deliver the supportive housing development.  With Perkins & Will in charge of the design, the new building will rise five floors, providing 28 SRO units and office space for Sarah’s Circle. A large meeting room, demo kitchen, computer lab, and laundry rooms will be available for use by the women living there. For Sarah’s Circle staff, there will be offices on the second floor including a conference room and outdoor terrace. 6 parking spaces will be provided alongside the alley. The Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units will be approximately 350 square feet and will include a refrigerator, oven, range, microwave, and individual HVAC unit. They will come furnished with a bed, dresser, nightstand, dining table and chairs. The organization will provide residents with bed linens, dishes, and cutlery.   The design of the 65-foot-tall building consists of three masses that separate the building. The base of the building is wrapped with brick and holds public space, the upper mass will hold the SRO units and office space, and the core of the building consists of a solid bar along the north side of the building. The separation reduces the scale by setting back the apartments from W. Lakeside Pl, while landscaping softens the corner of the property at the building’s entry. A mural will be painted on the north facade.   The $16 million project’s funding stack includes $4 million in multi-family program funds from the Chicago Department of Housing, approximately $3.85 million in IHDA Supporting Housing Program Funds, $1.35 million in IAHTC proceeds, roughly $3.1 million in ARO fee in-lieu funds from the 4600 N.

Committee on Design review Black Ensemble Theater development,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the Free To Be Village, a mixed-use development proposed by the Black Ensemble Theater. Planned for a site across the street from their existing space at 4450 N. Clark, the new building will rise at approximately 4427 N. Clark, replacing the one-story building that used to house the Japanese American Services Center and a parking lot. Dubbed the Free to Be Village, the project is aimed at bringing an arts and cultural destination to Uptown while forwarding Black Ensemble Theater’s goals of eradicating racism through the arts. The proposed mixed-use development will be a six-story, 78-foot-tall building that includes a 22,000-square-foot Performing Arts Education Center, 8,000-square-foot Media and Technology Center, 14,000 square feet of retail space, 50 affordable residential units and 92 new parking spaces. With the residential units set to be affordable for artists, the unit mix will include 37 one-beds and 13 two-beds. With Nia Architects and Gensler collaborating on the project, the design team began by considering three massing options, including a simple bar building, a second option that has a central plaza to activate the sidewalk, and a third option that had a full-depth open space splitting the project into two fully separated buildings.  The chosen massing begins with moving a full floor of cars below-grade, providing 71 spots underground. The ground floor provides a literary cafe at the corner of the site near the intersection of W. Sunnyside Ave and N. Clark St, with the lobby to the performing arts education center to the south of it. Retail occupies the center of the floor plate, with the residential lobby at the south end of the site. At the back, the remaining 21 parking spaces are accessed along the alley. Going up, the media and tech building rises at the corner, and the performance arts education center sits just south of it. The residential building rises separately on the southern half of the property with an angled massing. The design team studied different facade treatments for the media and tech building alongside the performing arts education center, with two more opaque concepts that use different materials and colors and a third concept that reads as a glass box with colorful volumes inside. The first two ideas were deemed too visually heavy and the glass box one wouldn’t have been ideal considering its energy use. The refined concept presented in the meeting uses a glazing system shaded by a twisted wooden louver. The residential portion also underwent facade studies playing with the colors and facade materials. With Site Design Group in charge of the landscaping, the project’s open space is viewed as the heart of the building, as a space to connect with the community and have them connect with the programming in the building. With two levels of public space, the design calls for a sloped walkway that creates an amphitheater of seating and planters to connect the public plaza to a public rooftop deck on the second floor. To close the upper terrace at night, a perforated screen wall creates an opportunity for commissioning an art piece or mural instead of simply creating a harsh barrier. The development will exhibit sustainability by achieving LEED Silver and Enterprise Green Communities, as well as by decarbonizing the building, providing onsite renewables, installing green roofs, and including EV charging stations.  The discussion opened with Eleanor Gorski, who enjoyed the site plan and thought the team addressed the program in a thoughtful manner, but wondered about the scale of the building up against the three residential homes to the north along W. Sunnyside Ave. The design team responded that they have tried to maintain heights within the context as much as possible and it has been a large discussion in the community meetings they have had.  Catherine Baker chimed in with a similar concern, wondering about the north elevation of the performing arts education center and how it looked like a five-story blank wall. The design team responded that they would study the building’s facade and adjacency to the residential buildings.  Philip Enquist spoke next, commending the team on a wonderful design and expressing his thoughts that the massing and emphasis on three distinct volumes was a great way to break up the program. While agreeing that the north wall seems to need some work with the existing townhouses, Enquist thought the media tech and housing buildings worked really well and the luminous facade screened with wood was very imaginative. Enquist finished his comments by questioning what the role of the amphitheater would be on a normal day. Jackie Taylor from the Black Ensemble Theater responded that they visualized the amphitheater as a community space for the community to use as they see fit, letting them program it and activate it in their own way.  Maria Villalobos was the last person to comment, questioning the amount of retail on the ground floor. Jackie Taylor responded that the retail space is there to earn revenue for the theater while also pushing forward their mission of eradicating racism. With that in mind, Taylor said they would be working to fill the retail space only with retailers who share their vision, with hopes of including a restaurant. With input received from the committee, the development team and DPD will review and take the comments into consideration as the project moves forward. With a rezoning and Planned Development proposed, the development will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council. ",Uptown,0.0
McHugh Construction completes Platform 4611,"McHugh Construction has announced the completion of Platform 4611, a nine-story mixed-use apartment building developed by The John Buck Company and Free Market Ventures at 4611 N. Broadway. The building brings 200 rental units and approximately 9,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space to the northeast corner of N. Broadway and W. Wilson Ave, just steps from the Wilson CTA train station. “Having started on the building during the height of the pandemic, we were thrown a couple of curve balls, but our team presented creative solutions throughout the project that saved time and added value,” said Jeanne Bartels, McHugh senior project manager who oversaw the construction of Platform 4611. “From using existing foundations to strategically reduce costs to securing materials and appliances through our broad network of suppliers during the pandemic-induced supply chain challenges, McHugh was able to deliver this project on schedule and on budget.” Designed by Pappageorge Haymes, the mid-rise building features a masonry and glass façade. Levels two through eight offer a mix of studio, one-, and two-bedroom units, while the top floor includes two two-bedroom and two three-bedroom penthouse units and a host of building amenities. Units feature exposed concrete ceilings, poured and finished by McHugh Concrete, the project’s concrete subcontractor. Building features include secured elevators, a fitness center, and reservable office space on each residential floor. The rooftop amenity floor is home to a dedicated co-working space as well as an outdoor terrace offering grilling stations for residents, multiple seating areas, and sweeping views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline. As a transit-oriented development steps from the Wilson CTA train station’s Red and Purple Lines, Platform 4611 also offers its residents easy access to downtown Chicago as well as provides surface-level parking for 22 vehicles and interior parking from 178 bicycles.  Platform 4611 welcomed its first residents in February 2023 and was 43% occupied as of late May.

Black Ensemble Theater proposes mixed-use expansion at 4427 N. Clark,"The Black Ensemble Theater has unwrapped plans for a new mixed-use development that will expand their operations and create a cultural corridor along N. Clark St in Uptown. Planned for a site across the street from their existing space at 4450 N. Clark, the new building will rise at approximately 4427 N. Clark, replacing the one-story building that used to house the Japanese American Services Center which will be moving to West Ridge. Dubbed the Free to Be Village, the project is aimed at bringing an arts and cultural destination to Uptown while forwarding Black Ensemble Theater’s goals of advancing equality in Chicago. Split into two buildings linked at the base, the complex will include a performing arts education center, media and technology space, and affordable artists housing. The project will be split into two phases, with the performing arts, media, and technology section coming first and the housing second. Designed by Nia Architects and Gensler, the first phase will stand four floors, rising on the north side of the site near the corner of N. Clark St and W. Sunnyside Ave. Designed with a glass curtain wall and wooden louvers, the light-filled building will soar 70 feet above the site while providing space for the media center, performance hall, and educational facility. Spaces in the building will include a literary cafe, archive room, film screening room, recording studio, editing station, dance studio, and classrooms.  Rising on the south portion of the property, the housing component will include a six-story building that will include 50 apartments planned to be rented at affordable levels for artists. Clad in a combination of metal paneling and wood planks, the housing portion will offer one-beds and two-beds with a community room and two collaboration rooms as amenities. Uniting the two buildings, the ground floor will place the residential lobby at the south end of the site and the performing arts and education center entry further north. In between, three retail spaces will total 13,000 square feet. At the back of the ground floor, 21 parking spaces will be accessible along the alley and a ramp will take cars down to the basement level for another 71 parking spaces to result in 92 car parking spaces. Designed by Site Design Group, a public plaza will carve into the ground floor, creating outdoor space that will be activated with performance space, terraced seating, and lush plantings. Public art by Black artists is planned to be placed along the street. Originally envisioned all the way back in 2009 when the current Black Ensemble Theater space was proposed and built, the Free To Be Village development is moving forward with a $5 million boost from Mackenzie Scott. The full build-out is expected to cost between $50-$70 million. With the zoning plan submitted to the city, the development will need a Planned Development designation approved by the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and full City Council. If all goes according to plan, the project is set to break ground in 2024. If you’re interested in learning more, the Black Ensemble Theater will be hosting a community meeting tomorrow June 6th from 6-7pm in-person at their current location at 4450 N. Clark.

City Council approves purchase of shuttered Aldi in West Garfield Park,"City Council has approved the plans to purchase the abruptly-closed Aldi in West Garfield Park. As part of its steps to help get a grocery store back to the West Garfield Park neighborhood, the City of Chicago has taken this step to allow the Department of Planning and Development to enter into a negotiated site acquisition agreement. First reported by Austin Weekly News, the store shuttered abruptly at the beginning of October 2021. After serving the neighborhood for over 30 years, the closure has left the neighborhood severely void of grocery stores. After discussions with Aldi, city officials reported in the December 2021 Community Development Commission meeting that Aldi will not reopen the location. The now-approved acquisition authority comes as part of the city’s strategy to get a grocer back into the retail space. While the city is not buying the plot at this time, the authority allows the city to quickly pivot to do so if that becomes their designated strategy. Currently, the city and DPD is actively referring grocers to the site’s broker to get a new grocery tenant as quickly as possible. If the city decides to pursue the purchase of the parcel, the city would pay $700,000 for the property and would allow them to control the re-tenanting process. Aldi is reportedly aware of the city’s move to potentially purchase the site and would engage in the sale. The acquisition goal would be to further help facilitate re-tenanting. DPD is looking to work with the local community to ensure the new use of the property meets the community’s needs. ",West Garfield Park,0.0

Two-tower residential development planned at 400 N. Elizabeth,"A rezoning application has been filed for a two-tower residential development at 400 N. Elizabeth. Fronting N. Elizabeth St, the irregularly shaped lot is bound by W. Ogden Ave to the west, N. Elizabeth St to the east, and Metra rail tracks to the north and south. Developer Mark Goodman & Associates who owns the site is teaming up with Weldon Development Group for the project. Designed by Archeo Design Studio, the new development proposal will include two residential towers totaling 724 apartments, with 145 (20%) of them set aside as affordable. Designed as two rectangular point towers, the towers will have gridded facades made up of metal panel and glazing. The parking floors will have a hybrid of architectural mesh and open-air glazing. On the eastern half of the site, the phase one tower will reach 395 feet tall with 384 residential units and 384 bike parking spaces. On the western half of the property, the second phase tower will reach 375 feet in height with 340 units and 340 bike parking spaces. Between the two buildings, residents will have access to a total of 348 parking spaces. On the ground floor, both residential lobbies will face east towards N. Elizabeth St. An access drive will stretch across the north side of the site for loading and parking access including a drop-off zone. Designed by Confluence, the southern portion of the site will have a pedestrian plaza that will include a pedestrian path connecting N. Elizabeth St and N. Ogden Ave. The proposal comes after developer Mark Goodman & Associates received approval for a 16-story life sciences office building back in November 2021. That building, designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, would have had approximately 503,000 square feet of lab and office space. Now partnering with Weldon Development Group, the new proposal is seeking to rezone the site to DX-7 before reinstituting the Planned Development. A 4.5 FAR bonus would increase the allowable FAR to 11.5. With the rezoning application submitted to the city, the development will undergo a full review and approval process, requiring approvals from Alderman Burnett, the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and full City Council.

Trammell Crow signs lease expansion with Belay Diagnostics,"Trammell Crow Company has announced that Belay Diagnostics has expanded its footprint at Fulton Labs only a few short months after signing a lease in August 2023. The company, which uses a proprietary molecular testing platform to revolutionize how brain and spinal cord cancers are detected, signed a deal for an additional 6,100 square feet of space at 1375 West Fulton, bringing its footprint at the life science building to just over 10,000 square feet. Belay will now occupy 5,750 square feet of expansion space on the ninth floor of the building, 420 square feet on the fifth floor, as well as the 4,000-square-foot science-ready lab suite that the company already occupies. Driven by positive fundraising efforts and clinical trial results, the company is rapidly growing, with plans to utilize its expanded space to advance its work on a proprietary molecular testing technology for brain and spinal cord cancers. “We are incredibly pleased that Belay has expanded their footprint within 1375 West Fulton,” said Morgan Baer-Blaska of TCC. “This expansion is a testament to the life science ecosystem that we are working to create across not only our Fulton Labs campus, but our entire life science portfolio in Chicago. The science-ready lab suites at 1375 were designed to be key contributors in the growth of their users, allowing companies to focus exclusively on their work, which ultimately results in a need for more space to accommodate the scale of each business. TCC’s expansive Fulton Labs campus, which also includes 400 N Aberdeen, stands at the ready to accommodate this growth that many tenants are experiencing; Belay’s recent expansion is a perfect example of this.” ""Fulton Labs and Trammell Crow offer not only world class space but a genuine partnership for emerging companies. It is uncommon to say you have a relationship with your landlord, but in this case, it is an honest assessment,"" shared Brian Coe, CEO of Belay Diagnostics. 1375 West Fulton is part of TCC's 725,000-square-foot Fulton Labs campus in Chicago, which includes nearby 400 North Aberdeen. Additionally, TCC’s Chicagoland lab portfolio includes Evanston Labs and Hyde Park Labs, both of which are set to deliver in 2024. ",West Loop,0.0
Developer pivots from condos to bathhouse at 1010 W. Madison,"Developer Fulton Street Cos. has scrapped plans for a 10-story condominium development in favor of a two-story bathhouse. Located at the northwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Morgan St, the 17,000-square-foot site is currently a surface parking lot. Designed by Gensler, the new scheme envisions a 40,000 square foot, two-story spa set to be occupied by New York-based Bathhouse. The building is set to include a rooftop restaurant and pool. Renderings show a concrete structure with arched bays filled in with opaque glazing. The scheme is a distinct shift from the ten-story condo building, a sign of the struggling condo market in the city. If it had been built, the condo building would have had 25 homes, priced from $2 million to $6 million. With the build-to-suit-lease planned with Bathhouse, construction could begin as soon as the beginning of 2024 with opening targeted for Spring 2025. ",West Loop,0.0
PRC approves adaptive reuse at 801 W. Madison,"The Permit Review Committee has approved plans for the adaptive reuse of the former Mid-City Trust & Savings Bank Building. Located at 801 W. Madison, the building occupies the southwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Halsted St. Purchased in 2022, ECG Madison LLC is leading the redevelopment of the building. With Pappageorge Haymes Partners serving as the architect, the project will rehabilitate the exterior and convert the interior into a hotel with commercial space on the ground floor. The landmark building’s significant features are designated as all exterior elevations including rooflines, as well as the interior entrance lobby of the main banking hall, including skylights, original check desks and counters, and historic lighting. On the exterior, the rehabilitation will clean, repair, and repaint the historic bronze windows on the first and second floors. Non-historic windows on the third through sixth floors will be repaired and replaced if they are beyond repair. A new entrance canopy along W. Madison St will be added for the hotel entrance and exterior uplighting will be installed on the building’s facade. A mural is proposed for a portion of the common brick on the west elevation, with historic preservation staff recommending the use of vapor permeable paint or attaching mural panels onto the masonry to prevent damage to the brick facade. On the interior, the rehab will retain historic features of the banking hall. The hotel’s main entrance will be at the northwest end of the building’s W. Madison St frontage, with the main entry to ground floor space at the northeast corner. A new passenger and service elevator will be added. A glass partition between interior columns will enclose the monumental stair for the hotel space to separate it from the rest of the ground floor banking hall space.  The elevator lobby and main corridors of the upper floors will be retained, and the existing door locations will be used for the hotel rooms wherever possible. The historic skylight will be modified and renovated to add a new daylighting system over the exterior skylight structure and a new translucent acoustical panel system will be added on the interior that will have the appearance of glazing.  With approval from the PRC, the redevelopment plan can move forward permitting and construction. A timeline for completion is currently unknown.  ",West Loop,1.0
Height and parking cited as issues for 420 N. May,"Developer Crescent Heights presented their revised design for 420 N. May to the local community, receiving heavy pushback on the proposed height and parking concerns. Located at the western end of the West Loop, the project site is bound by the Metra tacks to the north, N. May St to the east, W. Kinzie St to the south, and N. Racine Ave to the west.   Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the 53-story skyscraper would top out at 615 feet and include 587 residential units with just 3,100 square feet of retail space. To meet affordable requirements, 118 of the units, or 20%, will be set aside as affordable.  The tower’s design combines a vertical point tower that features faceted glazing with a stepped portion connected by an inset reveal between the two sections. At the base, the six-story podium is broken down with setbacks to maintain a relationship with the surrounding neighborhood context. At the southeastern corner of the site, an existing masonry brick building will be maintained and stained to integrate it into a cohesive podium expression. On the interior, the podium has been designed to activate all street-facing elevations. On the ground floor, the residential entry and common space will sit underneath the residential point tower, while leasing offices and retail space will face W. Kinzie St. A coworking amenity space and bike parking will face N. May St. On the upper floors of the podium, residential units will screen the parking spaces before the amenity deck tops off the podium. The existing water tower will also be retained in the new design. With parking a top concern, the developer already increased the parking count from 339 to 440 spaces. The developer said that they have seen an increased demand for parking at their other residential properties, so the increase of 101 spaces is in line with that increased demand and will help relieve pressure on nearby street parking. The extra parking spaces will be accommodated in a level of parking underground to avoid impacting the scale of the podium. Despite this increase, neighbors continued their calls for more parking and cited concerns over traffic in the neighborhood.   Another major concern for neighbors was the height of the building, citing concerns of the shadows it will cast on the buildings to the north of it and that it was “excessive” for the neighborhood. While the architects responded that this design was in line with architectural and urban design standards and direction from DPD, Alderman Burnett asked the developer to take a look at the height of the building, commenting that he doesn’t always agree with planning. As it stands, the developer is looking to rezone the site from M2-3 to DX-5 and get a FAR bonus of 3.1 by paying over $5 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. The Planned Development designation and rezoning needs approval from Alderman Burnett before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council can review and approve it. The projected $300 million development will need to receive its necessary approvals before looking to secure financing in these difficult financial times. The developer commented that the project is at least a year out from breaking ground if approvals and funding fall into place. The construction timeline would then take 26-30 months. ",West Loop,1.0
Belay Diagnostics signs lease at Trammell Crow’s Fulton Labs,"Trammell Crow Company signed a lease with Belay Diagnostics at 1375 West Fulton, where the company will lease a 4,000-square-foot science-ready lab suite. The company, which uses a proprietary molecular testing platform, licensed from Johns Hopkins, to revolutionize how brain and spinal cord cancers are detected, will move into the fifth-floor space in September. “The leasing momentum we have seen at our Fulton Labs campus this year is not only a testament to the world-class product we have developed, but to the evolution and continued growth of Chicago as hub for life science innovation,” said Morgan Baer-Blaska of TCC’s Chicago team. “We are excited that Belay Diagnostics chose Chicago and the science-ready lab suites at 1375 West Fulton as their homebase to conduct incredibly important and life-saving research.

Zoning application filed for 420 N. May,"A zoning application has been filed for Crescent Heights’ proposal for a 615-foot-tall tower at 420 N. May. Located at the western end of the West Loop, the project site is placed between the two sets of Metra tracks, bound by N. May St, W. Kinzie St, and N. Racine Ave.   Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the tower is planned as a focal point for the highly visible site, creating a gateway to the West Loop with an iconic design. The dynamic massing reflects the convergence of surrounding neighborhoods and extends the life and activity of the street vertically up the facade. An existing masonry building will be preserved and incorporated into the design, while a pedestrian corridor will be made where Ann St. used to run through the property. Rising 53 floors, the tower’s design began as an extrusion. That volume was stepped to the west and distinguished with a reveal and facets in the vertical massing. The design was completed by adding a crown and making the facade contextual. The bulk of the building sits to the west side of the site, with a lower six-story podium occupying most of the property towards the east.  At the ground floor, the first residential lobby will sit at the base of the tower, facing a pedestrian plaza at the northeast corner of W. Kinzie St and N. Racine Ave. Along W. Kinzie St, the building will hold 3,100 square feet of retail, a second residential entry, 2,700 square feet of coworking amenity, and a bike amenity space. Totaling 587 units, the building’s apartments will be a mix of micro, studio, one-beds, one-bed plus dens, two-beds, and three-beds. To meet affordable requirements, 118 units will be designated as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. Within the podium, 440 parking spaces (up from 339) will be wrapped with residential units facing the street frontages. 587 bike parking spaces will also be provided.  With the official zoning application submitted, the developers are moving forward with plans to rezone the site from M2-3 to DX-5 with a Planned Development designation that includes the use of a 3.1 FAR bonus. As the proposal progresses, it will need to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council for full approval.  ",West Loop,1.0
Fulton Labs scores another new tenant,"Trammell Crow Company has signed another lease at Fulton Labs. Located at 1375 W. Fulton, the newest tenant is Charles River Laboratories, who will occupy 8,800 square feet of space on the seventh floor. “Watching Fulton Labs come to life over the last few years has been an incredible journey for TCC and our project partners. The state-of-the-art campus is attracting users in the life sciences space that are seeking high-quality lab and office space that affords them an opportunity to grow in Chicago. We are energized to see the continued interest in the Fulton Labs properties, as well as the heightened interest in Chicago as a top-tier life sciences market,” said Morgan Baer-Blaska, Vice President with TCC. “We look forward to welcoming CRL into their new space at Fulton Labs later this year.”  CRL’s CRADL business already occupies 10,000 square feet on the ground floor at 1375 West Fulton. The campus was designed to meet the needs of the growing companies like CRL, which will use their expansion space to accelerate and augment their own clients’ discovery efforts. Trammell Crow has landed multiple other new tenants recently for the building, including the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago and Dimension Inx. Other tenants include Celadyne Technologies, Portal Innovations, Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Vanqua Bio and Talis Biomedical. ",West Loop,0.0
1101 W. Van Buren lands full building permit,"A full building permit has been issued for the mixed-use development at 1101 W. Van Buren. Sitting at the south end of S. Aberdeen St before the Eisenhower Expressway, the project is planned by Pizzuti Development. After being approved all the way back in 2015, the site has sat empty and the Planned Development designation almost expired until the developer received an extension from the Department of Planning and Development.  With Goettsch Partners on board for the revised design, the tower will rise 21 floors, down from 26 stories. While the height has been reduced from 274 feet down to 226 feet, the 298 apartments will be retained. The project will also reduce the previously approved 140 car parking spaces down to 82 parking spaces. With STL Architects previously in charge of the design, their plan called for a large rectangular volume that was adorned with modules of windows in different sizes. A large “frame” element was introduced at the amenity level as a feature piece of the design. The new design switches out the metal, gridded facade for one that is clad in glass and steel. Stretching out horizontally, the volume is broken up with a series of insets that stagger up the facade.  At the ground floor, the glass has been recessed to reveal brick-clad columns across the entire W. Van Buren St frontage. Residents will enter the building through the residential entry located at the middle of the building’s street frontage. Retail space will occupy the northeast corner, with coworking, a game room, and bike parking on the west end of the ground floor. Parking access will be from a private driveway on the eastern side of the property.   With all permits now issued, Power Construction can continue construction all the way through completion. The building is set to be completed in late 2024.  ",West Loop,0.0
City Council approves 1016 W. Jackson ,"The Chicago City Council has approved a proposed mixed-use development at 1016 W. Jackson. Located just west of the intersection of W. Jackson Blvd and S. Morgan St, the new tower would replace an existing five-story shared office building that includes a large parking lot. While currently nothing is proposed for it, the zoning application includes a second site just across the alley facing onto W. Adams St. Planned by Mavrek Development, the new mixed-use building will stand 28 floors tall, rising 295 feet to its parapet. As a mixed-use project, the tower will hold 370 residential units with a mix of 40% studios, 40% one-beds, and 20% two-beds. The ground floor will offer approximately 4,500 square feet of retail space fronting W. Jackson Blvd, along with the residential lobby and a bike room with 350 spaces for residents. With BKV Group in charge of the design, the building meets the ground with a three-story podium that has been setback to create a wider sidewalk along W. Jackson Blvd. The ground floor sets back further to create an arcade and inviting space for the residential entry which is tucked around the side behind the retail space fronting W. Jackson Blvd. Site Design Group has been tapped to design this pedestrian-friendly paseo with lighting, bike racks, outdoor furniture, and benches. Above the ground floor, the second and third floors of the podium will hold parking for 125 cars and will be screened from the exterior in a combination of metal paneling and translucent glass. The roof of the podium will be activated with an outdoor amenity deck for the residents which will include an outdoor pool. The tower portion of the building, rising above the podium, will be set back from the street with a T-shaped footprint and inset balconies. To create variety and interest, the tower will be clad in a combination of glass and rust-colored metal paneling composed in a way that contrasts portions of the building on each elevation.  To meet the ARO requirements, the developers have elected to provide all of the required 74 affordable units within the building at an average of 60% AMI. The project will meet sustainability requirements by achieving a Green Globes 2-Globes certification, implementing green roofs, providing EV charging stations, and ensuring construction waste diversion. With all approvals secured, the site will be rezoned from DS-3 to DX-5 with an overall Planned Development designation to head to the Committee on Zoning and then the full City Council. To receive a 3.1 FAR bonus, the developers will pay $1.85 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.  Since the current office building on the site has active businesses in the building, the site won’t be cleared until full approvals and funding is secured. With all city approvals secured, the developers expect to break ground on the $100 million by the end of 2023 and deliver the new building in Spring 2025. ",West Loop,1.0
Urbanize tours 150 N. Ashland,"Urbanize toured the recently topped out structure of 150 N. Ashland. Planned by Marquette Companies, the structure stands at the intersection of N. Ashland Ave and W. Lake St, where the Women’s Treatment Center used to stand. Designed by Brininstool + Lynch, the new 12-story building will connect to the adjacent 1920s building at the south end of the site. Rising 154 feet tall, the development will hold 210 dwelling units, with ground floor retail and amenity space. Walking with representatives from Marquette Companies and Power Construction, we began the tour by heading up to the 12th floor, which will house an amenity space as well as an east-facing outdoor deck. The interior amenity space was being prepped for a final concrete pour, with the rest of the rooftop planned for future mechanical units. Views from the deck overlook Union Park towards the West Loop and downtown beyond. Heading down the building, we stopped on the ninth floor where the very first mechanicals are being installed and the building is still open to the exterior. Units facing Union Park will have balconies protruding from the facade. Stopping next on the 6th floor, facade construction has begun with the installation of cold-form metal framing. The building exterior will be clad in fiber cement paneling hung on the cold-form metal framing with insulation in between. The third floor of the building has insulation attached on the exterior and is awaiting the fiber cement paneling. As part of the development, the adjacent 1920s structure is being renovated and incorporated into the building. Crews framed out a structural link and blew through the old building’s wall to connect the new structure to the old one. Due to uneven floor heights, the 5th floor will have ramps down into the historic building. Further down in the building, the second floor is the first level to have interior framing installed with drywall stacked and ready to be installed. On the ground floor, the historic building will hold residential amenities including an outdoor deck carved from an old mechanical area that will feature grilling stations. The ground floor of the new building will hold 27 parking spaces with the residential lobby and coworking spaces fronting N. Ashland Ave at a slightly lower elevation. The retail space will hold the corner at W. Lake St and N. Ashland Ave, with the remaining 26 parking spaces located on the basement level. With the building structure topped out, Power Construction plans to remove the tower crane in a few weeks and have the exterior enclosed by the summer. Turnover of units to ownership will occur in Q3 and Q4 this year, with pre-leasing set to begin late summer. Move-ins are expected to begin in November.  ",West Loop,1.0
Sterling Bay revises plan for 1300 W. Carroll,"Sterling Bay has presented its revised plans for 1300 W. Carroll. Located at the northwestern corner of Fulton Market, the large site is bound by N. Elizabeth St to the east, W. Carroll Ave to the south, N. Ada St to the west, and the Metra tracks to the north. Originally revealed in Fall 2021, Sterling Bay has been going through the review process with DPD since then to get to the current version of the project. With SOM in charge of the design, the scheme still includes two towers that are mixed-use with retail, office space, and residential units. Originally designed with a bar typology, the towers have been redesigned as point towers separated across the site as far as possible. Designing more slender towers allows for them to have a skyline presence of points rather than walls.   Focusing on Phase 1, the revised tower will stand 515 feet tall with 40 floors. Planned to be mixed-use, the first four floors will have ground floor retail space and office space along the south frontage with parking behind. With a total of 259 spaces, there will be one floor of parking placed underground to mitigate the height of the podium. With an amenity level and outdoor deck on the fifth floor, full office floors continue above on the sixth through ninth floors. The 10th floor will hold more amenities before the building switches to a vertical tower on floors 12 through 38 which will hold 361 residential units.  Inspired by the former ADM Flour Mill, elements from the historic structure have been interpreted in contemporary ways. The office portion is designed with a concrete expression and fronts W. Carroll Ave with rounded bay windows that are reminiscent of the silos. Along N. Elizabeth St, the bay windows give way to an X-ray expression of the structural system showing the columns and their capitals. Every office floor will get an inset terrace that breaks down the podium’s scale, with the residential entry located on the northern end of the Elizabeth St frontage. The residential tower above will be clad in metal and glass topped by a silo-like crown that creates a recognizable feature on the skyline. Working with Omni Ecosystems, the first phase will see the construction of a new pocket park across N. Elizabeth St to the east. The green space will be linked to the development with newly widened sidewalks that will be uninterrupted since all of the curb cuts have been consolidated into one access point for parking and loading off of N. Ada St. The north terminus of N. Elizabeth St has been pulled back to expand the pocket park with a provision for a potential future Metra stop connection along the tracks. While the second phase was not presented in detail, the building has been pushed to the southwest corner of the site and will also be a point tower set to rise 418 feet. Shaped for daylighting, the second phase will also include a heavily expanded plaza midblock along W. Carroll Ave. Paired with Phase 1, the buildings will produce a total of 741 units (down from an original 971) and have a combined FAR of 10. The development will be paying $4.27 into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to receive an FAR bonus and the residential buildings will include 20% affordable units, producing 72 units in Phase 1.   While a date for a Plan Commission hearing has not been set, Sterling Bay hopes to begin construction on Phase 1 by Q4 2023 and would take two years to build. Phase 2 would then begin construction within a year of completing Phase 1. ",West Loop,1.0

Urbanize tours construction progress at Embry,"Urbanize recently toured Embry, a new 16-story residential tower at 21 N. May. Planned by Sulo Development, the project will bring 58 luxury condominiums to the area. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the 201-foot-tall structure will be clad in an Art Deco-inspired facade with floor-to-ceiling windows and a bronzed aluminum finish.  Starting at the top, the 15th floor will be home to the two penthouse units offered in the building. With taller 11-foot windows, the homes will have extensive access to the outdoors with large outdoor terraces measuring 2,200 square feet each with their own private swimming pools. Stopping one floor down, the 14th floor is the highest typical floor plate, with four condos that will each have direct to unit access from the elevator. To give west-facing homes a downtown view, the building steps out at the north and south ends to give the units an east-facing view corridor.  Heading down the building, our next stop was the 5th floor where crews are installing the facade. Designed as a window wall system, the facade has an Art Deco-inspired profile that reacts to the sun as it moves throughout the day. Due to its more complex nature, the window wall system takes crews two weeks to complete one floor.  Stopping down a level on the fourth floor, the building is fully enclosed on this level and mechanicals are being installed. With a post-tensioned concrete structure, the floor plates have very few columns, allowing for better unit layouts. Materials for interior framing have been staged and are awaiting installation.  Our next stop was the third floor, which has the top level of the duplexes overlooking N. May St. With living spaces on the third floor, each unit has its bedrooms on the second floor. Framing was just beginning on the third floor, while the second floor is close to fully framed. With amenities occupying the eastern part of the second floor, residents will have access to a chef’s kitchen and lounge, tenant storage, and fitness center. A southern terrace will offer residents fire pits and grilling stations, while the northern terrace will have a dog run and putting green. Heading down further, we stopped briefly in the basement which will house underground parking. To meet market demands without having a large podium, the building was designed with one level of underground parking in addition to ground floor parking. Offering 78 spaces, the ground floor’s facade has been designed to screen the parking behind it.  With the tower topping out back in mid-January, window installation is ongoing and set to finish in the second quarter of this year. With McHugh Construction leading the construction, a full turnover to the development team is planned for Q4 2023. ",West Loop,0.0
Foundation permit issued for 1217 W. Washington,"A foundation permit has been issued for a mixed-use development at 1217 W. Washington. Located between two adjacent historic buildings, the site is currently a vacant lot that overlooks the intersection of W. Washington Blvd and N. Willard Ct. DAC Developments is collaborating with Melrose Ascension Capital on the project.    Designed by Pappageorge Haymes, the project consists of a 19-story mixed-use tower. Expected to rise 213 feet, the tower will hold 4,000 square feet of retail space and 287 residential units. The apartment mix is expected to be approximately 45% studios, 35% one-bedrooms, and 20% two-bedroom rentals. The building will host 183 parking spaces for residential tenants. The building meets the ground with a four-story podium that will hold the ground floor retail space, residential lobby, and parking on the upper three floors. The street-facing facade will be made up of brick and punched window openings. The ground floor will open up with storefront glazing and a recessed entry protected by a glass canopy. Setback 25 feet from the street, the tower portion will be articulated with a metal frame pattern that contrasts with and projects from the glass facade. The top two floors will hold amenity space including indoor programming and an outdoor deck with pool. With a foundation permit hand, general contractor Focus Construction can get started on the $100 million development. With an approximate 18-month timeline, the development is set to wrap up in Spring 2024.  ",West Loop,0.0
Skender complete buildout of offices for Fetch,"Skender has completed the interior buildout of a new Chicago office for Fetch, the nation's No. 1 rewards app and leading consumer-engagement platform, founded in Madison, Wisconsin. The 20,000+-square-foot workspace spans the top three floors at 609 W. Randolph, a new West Loop office building completed in 2022 and built by Skender as general contractor. The finished space features 60 open-concept workstations, three café areas, three all-gender restrooms, 19 conference rooms, 17 phone rooms and a game room outfitted with arcade machines and a pool table. To meet Fetch’s need for an all-hands space, two of the conference rooms can be combined through the use of an operable partition, then further combined with the neighboring café via the rollup of two glass doors, creating one large integrated area for all-company meetings and events. Additionally, the AV systems in the all-hands space are set up to function seamlessly as both individual rooms and as one cohesive room, a complex programming process that required the company to have its own AV network.  “This move gives Fetch ample room to grow and stretch out,” said Brian Eddy, Project Manager at Skender. “Our team seamlessly embraced the challenges presented by the simultaneous construction on three separate floors as well as the complexities of the AV system setup. Fetch employees now have a modern new office that caters to many kinds of work styles.” “As a remote-first hybrid company, Fetch empowers employees to design flexible work arrangements tailored to their role, and we've structured our operations to maximize collaboration across virtual and in-person environments,” said Rachel Olchowka, Chief People Officer at Fetch. “Physical office space plays a key role in our work and culture by serving as a hub where employees can come together to foster innovation, strengthen connections, and bring our shared values to life.” Construction started in March 2023 and wrapped up on time in July. In addition to Skender’s role as general contractor, the project team consisted of architect BOX Studios; Lumen Workplace acted as owner’s representative; the engineering and LV engineering was completed by Cosentini and Engineering Plus respectively; CBRE acted as broker.

Permits are in the works for 566 W. Van Buren,"New construction permits have been filed for the planned new mixed-use development at 566 W. Van Buren. Planned by Riverside Investment & Development and Bluestar Properties, the project was previously occupied by a three-story masonry building and a two-story masonry building which were both recently demolished. The rest of the site is currently a surfacing parking lot. With a design from Antunovich Associates, the new 14-story tower will rise 155 feet within the site’s existing DX-7 zoning. The new development will deliver 198 residential units with 2,500 square feet of retail on the ground floor facing the intersection of W. Van Buren St and S. Jefferson St. The residential lobby will front W. Van Buren St, with balconies rising above on the south facade. Planned with a mix of studios, junior one-beds, one-beds, one-bed plus dens, and two-beds, residents will have access to a suite of rooftop amenities including a fitness center, co-working space, and a club room. On an exterior rooftop deck, residents will have access to a rooftop pool and grilling stations. On the ground floor, a dog run and dog spa are located behind the parking ramp along the alley. Parking for residents will total 76 car parking spaces and 99 bicycle spaces. Parking access for 24 cars on the ground floor will be via the public alley, with a parking ramp off of S. Jefferson St for the remaining 52 spaces on the second floor. The building has been designed to fit into the context of the West Loop neighborhood incorporating a brick and glass façade. The parking floors are clad with translucent glass and the ground floor will be set back approximately 2 feet from the property line to provide a wider sidewalk with new street planters and trees along both Jefferson and Van Buren Streets. The existing curb cut on Van Buren Street has been removed and the Jefferson Street curb cut has been reduced by 5’ for the parking entrance. The project is being developed as an as-of-right development which means that the building fits under the existing zoning rights. Since no formal city approvals are required, the developers can move forward with construction once permits are issued. While a timeline for completion is currently unknown, Lendlease has been tapped to serve as the general contractor. ",West Loop Gate,0.0
The Warehouse is officially a Chicago landmark,"The Chicago City Council has officially designated The Warehouse as a Chicago Landmark. Located at 206 S. Jefferson, the building, built in 1910, was home to a local dance club that became the birthplace of House music. According to a landmarks staff report, the building meets Criterion 1 for its value as an example of architectural, cultural, economic, historic, or social heritage. As the home of The Warehouse from 1977 to 1982, the dance club was the birthplace of house, a genre of dance music characterized by a driving beat, emotive lyrics and lush orchestration drawn from a number of genres including disco, R&B, gospel and techno. The Warehouse is also culturally significant to Chicago’s LGBTQ, Black and Latino community as the first supporters of house music at The Warehouse and who found a sense of community, self-expression and hope in The Warehouse’s revolutionary music. Over time, The Warehouse became popular with a broad range of Chicago club goers, and it was one of the first venues that broke down the barriers between gay and straight club scenes. Meeting Criterion 3 for its identification with a significant person, The Warehouse is significant for its association with DJ Frankie Knuckles, influential American DJ, record producer, and remix artist, who significantly contributed to the music culture of the City of Chicago and the United States as the “Godfather of house music.” DJ Frankie Knuckles, one of Chicago’s cultural pioneers, created house by transforming existing songs by extending, combining and overlapping them to create completely new experiences of music. Knuckles also used analog and digital technologies to alter songs to make them more up-tempo and danceable. The building also meets the Integrity Criterion as the design and materials of the building are intact from The Warehouse’s tenure between 1977 and 1982. The neighborhood context is somewhat altered by new construction, but many industrial loft buildings from the period of The Warehouse survive. The significant features of the building will be designated as all exterior elevations, including rooflines.  With the landmark designation approved, the building is officially saved from demolition. The current owners have expressed their intent to keep the building as an office building, with it currently occupied by a few office tenants.  ",West Loop Gate,0.0

City Council approves 640 W. Randolph,"The Chicago City Council has approved a new mixed-use tower at 640 W. Randolph. Planned by Vista Property Group, the new building would occupy a corner site near the developer’s recently completed 609 W. Randolph. Currently a surface parking lot, the site is located at the northwest corner of W. Randolph St and N. Desplaines St.  Designed by Antunovich Associates, the new mixed-use building will rise 15 floors, holding approximately 2,500 square feet of retail space and roughly 117,00 square feet of office space across 12 floors. Standing 225 feet high, the building will include 19 parking spaces on the second floor, a ground floor bike room, and rooftop amenities that include a club room, outdoor terrace, fitness center, and meeting center. Occupying a narrow site, the building has been designed with a modern loft aesthetic, with the use of brick and divided-lite windows. The facade has been designed to have a higher percentage of glass than 609 W. Randolph and each office floor will have a private, west-facing terrace. The west facade underwent major changes when the building core was shifted towards the interior of the building, allowing for active space and vision glass along the west facade. Previously, the west facade was a concrete shear wall, but now has been articulated with brick and punched window openings. On the ground floor, the retail space will hold the corner, with the office lobby fronting W. Randolph St. The bike room for tenants will also be accessible from W. Randolph St at the westernmost end of its street frontage. The rest of the ground floor will hold back-of-house spaces along the alley with the parking and loading access from the alley. The parking ramp was relocated to the alley instead of opening onto N. Desplaines St in response to feedback from Alderman Reilly. To meet sustainability requirements, the building will exceed energy code, exceed the stormwater ordinance by 50%, is located in proximity to transit, will provide bike parking, plant trees, reduce indoor water use, install EV charging stations, install a CTA digital display, ensure construction waste diversion, and implement bird protection. The developers will pay $1.3 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to receive a 4.5 FAR bonus. With the green light from the Chicago City Council, the project is fully entitled and the developers can move forward towards construction. W.E O’Neil will be serving as the general contractor for the project. ",West Loop Gate,1.0

Office tower proposed for 640 W. Randolph,"Developer Vista Property Group has proposed a new mixed-use tower at 640 W. Randolph.

CoD reviews 655 W. Madison,"The Committee on Design has reviewed the two-tower office plan for 655 W. Madison. Located along the Kennedy Expressway, the project site is a full-block lot bound by W. Madison St, N. Desplaines St, W. Monroe St, and the highway. Conceived by The John Buck Company, the project is targeted at office tenants flocking to high quality Class-A office space within the city. Designed as a collaboration between JGMA and HOK, the development consists of 1.5 million square feet of office space situated within two towers rising 39 and 29 stories. Retail and restaurant space will activate the ground floor, while parking will occupy three floors of the podium. Atop the podium, a one-acre rooftop park has been designed by Site Design Group, with multiple amenity offerings connected to the park on that floor.  The project’s massing began as an extrusion of the site that was carved out to create a void between the two towers whose heights have been staggered. At the base, a sense of human scale has been added, with the towers having been separated visually from the podium. The tower masses have been carved to angle away from each other with the horizontal orientation of the floor plates accentuated with enlarged spandrels.  Driven by the expectations of Class-A commercial high-rise development, the towers have been developed with distinctive floor plates that measure 30,000 square feet on the low-rise portions and 27,000 square feet on the high-rise levels. Balconies will be included on the west elevation on every third floor. Each office floor will have its own isolated exhaust and intake air for the HVAC system, never mixing air between floors inside the building. The articulated spandrels on the tower act as functional gills to provide the fresh air for each floor. At the ground floor, the site design will shift as Phase 1 and Phase 2 are built over time. The lobby for the northern tower will face the intersection of W. Madison St and N. Desplaines St, pulled back from the property line to increase sidewalk space. A retail space will occupy the northwest corner of the floor plate and a large restaurant space will face onto N. Desplaines St with a wide sidewalk space for outdoor dining. After Phase 1 is complete, an entry plaza will occupy the footprint of Phase 2 while it is awaiting construction. Once construction on Phase 2 is complete, the southern tower’s lobby will occupy its respective corner, continuing the building setback to create a generous outdoor space. Parking and loading access will be off the western end of W. Monroe St. The discussion began with Lesley Roth asking about the treatment of the exposed walls that will face the open footprint of Phase 2 before it is constructed. The development team commented that they are looking at the need to enclose the podium on the southern side and have yet to determine what it would be. While they think preleasing efforts may mean they could start construction of Phase 2 directly after completing Phase 1, plans for covering that south facade could include a conventional wall or public art. Sara Beardsley asked if the park on top of the podium will be accessible to the public. The development team responded yes, and the design team tried to show the circulation via one of the elevators in Phase 1. John Ronan chimed in to question how anyone from the public unaffiliated with the building would know how to get up to the park. Ronan felt that it is not a truly public space and should just be restricted to the office tenants. Sara Beardsley also questioned how it would feel to be next to this large, six-story podium and how the architecture could be used to alleviate the mass. The development team spoke about how the carve outs in the base of the building work towards a human scale and the number of setback entries create some shelter as you walk around the building. Brian Lee discussed the importance of the project as a contribution to the city and that he sees it as an island that is not related to its surroundings. Lee questioned whether the amount of parking could be reduced to bring the green space closer to the public realm. Ultimately, considering a set of issues with the proposal, Lee wondered whether such a strong developer and design team could do more to elevate the level of commercial architecture in Chicago. Replying specifically to the discussion of parking, the development team said that parking is always a tradeoff where they would like people to take public transportation, bike, or walk to work. However, in a post-COVID world, the ability to drive and park at work rather than taking the train can be a significant decision for office tenants and with the direct adjacency of the Kennedy Expressway this can be a strong advantage for leasing the building. As a concession, the design team noted that the parking floors are isolated from the ramps and the floor-to-floor height is taller than usual so it would be possible to convert it to other uses in the future. With the Committee on Design review complete, the development team and DPD will review and take the comments into consideration as the project moves forward. Due to an already approved Planned Development active on the site, it is currently unclear what slate of approvals the plan will be required for the project.   ",West Loop Gate,1.0

John Buck proposes two-tower office project at 655 W. Madison,"The John Buck Company has revealed plans for a proposed two-tower office development at 655 W. Madison. Conceived for a full-block site along the Kennedy Expressway, the new proposal would replace an existing surface parking lot bound by W. Madison St to the north, N. Desplaines St to the east, and W. Monroe St to the south.  Designed by JGMA and HOK, the new plan would consist of a 36-story northern tower that would hold 850,000 square feet of space. Mirrored to the south, the southern tower will be slightly shorter and house just 600,000 square feet of office space. To connect the two buildings, a five-story podium will occupy the entire site footprint and will be topped with a two-acre outdoor urban park. Reported in a recent article in Crain’s, the project scope is a shift from a taller 1.5 million-square-foot tower originally planned when John Buck Company made a deal with the site’s owner back in 2019. Shifted to allow for more flexibility, John Buck indicated that construction could begin based on the pre-leasing of 150,000-200,000 square feet rather than a typical anchor tenant lease of 500,000 square feet. Tenants will have access to a secure porte cochere for arrival with over 200 parking spots provided within the project. 55,000 square feet of space will be set aside for tenant amenities as well as an outdoor park spanning an acre on top of the shared podium. The towers will have a state-of-the-art HVAC system that ensures that each floor has its own dedicated airflow, not sharing between floors.  While the project is within the site’s zoning, the project will need approval from City Council before construction could begin.

Office renovation and addition lands permits at 550 W. Randolph,"Permits have been issued for an office renovation and addition project at 550 West Randolph Street in West Loop Gate. The existing warehouse building is located at the corner of W Randolph Street and N Clinton Street. W.P. Carey is the developer in charge of the project.  With a design by Gensler, the development proposes to convert a turn-of-the-century brick and heavy timber warehouse into a bold and contemporary office building. Built in 1909, the timber-framed masonry warehouse was originally built as a central distribution center for McKesson & Robbins, a wholesale apothecary, elixir and drug distributor. The revamped and expanded six-story building will span 227,500 square feet, with large, efficient, and flexible floor plates nearing 39,500 feet each. The structure will include LEED Gold sustainable design features and tenant amenities. The proposal will reinvigorate the historic building, restoring the original façade and creating a contemporary addition with highly tailored details both inside and out. The addition will allow for the expansion of the building footprint, providing even greater open and flexible floor plates. The facade restoration will also create an engaging retail and streetscape experience. Tenant-focused amenities include a rooftop outdoor terrace and green space, a covered rooftop bar and lounge, shaded outdoor lounge areas, a ground floor lobby lounge, a fitness center with a wellness center, showers, and locker rooms, a conference meeting room space, and an indoor bike room. The salvaged heavy timber structure and metal strapping will be exposed throughout the interior, celebrating the heritage of the original warehouse. Further finishes of walnut, brass, and leather will give the building’s refined public spaces a historic resonance. Details of the interior are expected to recall the ornate and colored apothecary glassware once filled on site, while plant choices will reinforce the story of health and wellness through botanical species used in early medicine. With permits issued, general contractor Power Construction can begin work on site. Completion of the project was originally expected for the end of 2021 according to Alderman Reilly’s newsletter back in December 2020, but a new completion date has yet to be announced.

640 W. Washington gets haircut and redesign,"The mixed-use tower planned for 640 W. Washington Blvd has gotten trimmed and redesigned. Announced via Alderman Reilly’s recent newsletter to constituents, developer Crescent Heights has redesigned the project in advance of construction planning.  Originally approved by City Council in May 2021, the mixed-use tower was approved to rise 47 stories and 520 feet. The building would hold 413 residential units, 217 bicycle parking spaces, 137 car parking spaces, and provide approximately 8,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.  Changes in the new redesign include the reduction of height from 520 feet and 47 stories to 425 feet and 38 stories. This height chop removes the glassy top portion of the tower, while increasing the height of the main volume slightly. The tower massing has been widened east to west, shifting the bay spacing of the south and north elevations. At the podium, one floor was added, increasing the podium height from 46 feet to 51 feet. The parking count was also reduced from 137 to 121. Unit counts and mix will remain the same.  ﻿This change will not require any approvals from Alderman Reilly, the Committee on Zoning, or the City Council. The developer plans to begin construction later this year. ",West Loop Gate,1.0
Rendering vs. Reality: Downtown Porsche dealership opens,"Work is complete on a new Porsche dealership in the base of the Presidential Towers in West Loop Gate. Known as Porsche of Downtown Chicago, the project represents the first—and so-far only—Porsche dealership within Chicago city limits.  Developed and owned by Napleton Automotive Group, the showroom and service facility stands at the northeast corner of Jefferson and Monroe streets. The dealership occupies a commercial space that has sat vacant since the Walmart Neighborhood Market small-format grocery store closed in early 2017. Car dealerships typically represent the opposite of sound urban design, but this one is about as inoffensive as they come. It lacks a large surface lot and uses an existing curb cut and driveway for its service department. The design from RC Bowman Architecture utilizes a frameless storefront system and a minimalist (albeit on-brand) corporate facade of gray and black metal panels.  Although the dealership repurposes an existing space, the project did have to go before the city in May 2020 for a technical zoning amendment to allow additional uses, including ""indoor light equipment sales and rental” and “motor vehicle repair.""  General contractor International Contractors, Inc. started interior demolition later that year and was issued its build-out permit in January 2021.          ",West Loop Gate,0.0
Two-tower apartment project advances in West Loop Gate,"A plan from developer Pacific Reach Properties to build more than 1,000 apartments across a pair of high-rise towers at 601 W. Monroe Street is moving forward. The Chicago Plan Commission recently signed off on the development, which would replace a surface parking lot between the four Presidential Towers, Heritage Green Park, and Old St. Patrick's Church. Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, the project would be constructed in two phases. The first phase, slated for the eastern portion of the site, calls for a 535-foot high-rise containing 537 rental units and 400 parking spaces. A second 465-foot-tall tower with 516 apartments and 30 parking spaces will be built west of the first building. The plan includes ground-floor retail space, a small publicly accessible dog park, and a fifth-floor amenity deck shared by the two towers. Chicago's affordable housing rules require the project to provide 105 below-market-rate apartments. Pacific Reach will build 26 of those units on-site and pay a $14.8 million ""in lieu fee"" to the city's affordable housing fund to cover the rest of their obligation. The developer will also be on the hook for a $5.5 million contribution to the city's Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, which supports economic investment in underserved communities on the city's South and West sides. The Planned Development for 601 W. Monroe will need the support of the city's Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards and the full City Council before any work can begin. An executive at Pacific Reach told the Chicago Tribune that the company intends to break ground on the 47-story eastern tower in early 2022 and deliver the building in mid-2024. The 40-story western tower would open later in 2025, according to the newspaper. The area between the Chicago River and Kennedy Expressway has seen an impressive amount of development in recent years. Commercial projects such as BMO Tower, 609 W. Randolph Street, and the adaptive reuse of the Old Post Office will soon be joined by notable residential developments, including the 373 apartments under construction at 354 N. Union Avenue and a planned 413-unit rental tower at nearby 640 W. Washington Boulevard.   ",West Loop Gate,1.0
515-foot apartment tower next to the Kennedy passes Plan Commission,"A proposal from Crescent Heights to redevelop a parking lot at 640 W. Washington Boulevard into a 515-foot-tall apartment tower passed the Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday. The downtown project will bring 413 luxury rental units to the West Loop Gate, located between the Chicago River and the Kennedy Expressway. 
Designed by Chicago-based Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the slender tower will rise on the western edge of the site. A low-rise portion to the east will contain 20,000 square feet of amenities, 8,000 square feet of retail, and off-street parking for 137 vehicles and 217 bicycles. There will also be a porte-cochere below the building to move loading and standing traffic off surrounding streets such as Des Plaines. The dark masonry and glass design draws influences from the historic West Loop buildings on the other side of the highway as well as the contemporary high-rises to the east. The result is a ""modern high-rise with a warm warehouse feel,"" according to HPA architect Megan Zack at a virtual public meeting this spring. The development's 413 apartments will be offered in studio, one-, and two-bedroom floorplans averaging between 650 and 700 square feet in size. Pricing will be ""in line with other Class A buildings in this submarket,"" according to Crescent Heights's Jason Buchberg, who estimates rents reaching the high $3 per square foot range.  Under the city's current affordable housing rules, Crescent Heights is required to provide 10 percent affordable housing, which rounds up to 42 apartments. The developer will provide 11 of those units on-site and pay roughly $5.8 million to the city's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund, according to a zoning application filed in January. The project will also contribute $3.7 million to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund in exchange for a density bonus. The requested zoning change for the project—from DX-7 to a Residential Planned Development—will also need the support of the Committee on Zoning and the full City Council. If approvals move forward as planned, it's unclear when exactly the developer intends to break ground at 640 W. Washington. ""We are in a fluid economic climate,"" said Buchberg at the Neighbors of the West Loop community meeting. ""The intent here is to secure the entitlements and to break ground when it actually makes sense. We've eyed the site for quite a while and we've closed on the site, so we have every intention of moving forward with the project at the right time.""  Crescent Heights is a national developer with a growing footprint in many major cities including Los Angeles. In Chicago, the company recently completed the 76-story, 800-unit NEMA Chicago apartment tower in the South Loop. Crescent Heights has plans for a second, taller ""phase two"" skyscraper next door, but is prioritizing the 640 Washington site for the time being. ""We already have a large asset in the [South Loop] and [the West Loop] is a submarket that we've always wanted to be active in, so the focus is here,"" added Buchberg. ""Certainly if the market improves we can do both at the same time, but we've shifted the development team's focus to this project at this time.""      ",West Loop Gate,0.0
Fifth City Commons begins construction at 3155 West 5th Ave,"At a ceremony held on July 26, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson led a groundbreaking ceremony for Fifth City Commons, a new affordable housing complex which will rise from a long-vacant property on Chicago's West Side. Skender, the project's general contractor, is working with Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH), which was selected in 2019 to develop the site at 3155 West 5th Ave through the C40 Reinventing Cities competition. Plans call for the construction of a new three-story building which will feature 43 one-, two, and three-bedroom rental units for East Garfield Park residents earning between 30 and 80 percent of the area median income level. “Fifth City Commons and the City of Chicago, with its commitment to and investment in sustainable affordable housing, transportation, and energy-efficiency will demonstrate the impact cities and the built environment can have on climate change,” said Mayor Johnson at the ceremony. “More than 100 years after Chicago showed the world how to design and build skyscrapers, today we are poised to lead the way in the development of sustainable affordable housing. As Mayor, and as a West Sider – I could not be more excited.” The all-electric project incorporates features such as triple pane windows and rooftop solar panels to limit energy usage. Plans also call for landscaping, EV charging, bicycle parking, and space for on-site composting. The complex will be all-electric, with sustainable features such as triple pane windows and air sealing to lower the building’s energy needs in accordance with Passive House principles. Two-thirds of all its energy needs will be supplied by rooftop solar panels. The property will also have mature landscaping, EV charging stations, extensive bicycle parking, and on-site composting.  Perkins & Will is designing Fifth City Commons alongside Nia Architects, which would provide residents with access to community rooms, a fitness room, an outdoor terrace, and three laundry rooms. “It is a privilege to work on the construction of such a sustainable development with POAH and the community,” said Skender project executive Joe Pecoraro. “We are excited to see the positive impact this building will have on the West Side.” Funding for Fifth City Commons comes from tax increment financing and HOME Investment Partnership Program assistance, sales tax returns, bonds, and low-income housing tax credits. Most of this funding was provided through the City of Chicago. ",West Side,0.0

A bike room and leasing office are located between the residential lobby and retail space. Amenity space and a rooftop deck will be included for residents on the seventh floor. With a total of 28 parking spaces, the building will have a garage along the back of the building that will hold 24 spaces in a diagonal layout that includes an access point from W. Grand Ave and through the alley. An additional four spaces in a private garage area will be accessed from the alley. Variations approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals include a variation to allow a curb cut and driveaway along a public street, a variation to permit the building facade to be setback greater than five feet, which is a pedestrian street requirement, a variation to reduce the rear setback from 30 feet to zero for floors with dwelling units, a variation to eliminate the one required loading berth, and a variation to reduce the required number of parking spaces from 99 down to 28. The Zoning Board of Appeals also approved a special use application to establish residential use below the second floor. While the project does include retail space, the amount of retail space is less than required by zoning, so the city disregards it and requires the special use despite the fact that the building has no ground floor residential units. With approval from the ZBA, the developer can move forward with permitting and construction. Permits for the new construction are currently pending and awaiting issuance. ",West Town,0.0

Wicker Park condo proposal passes zoning committee,"A long-discussed plan to redevelop a vacant former used car lot near the border of Wicker Park and Humboldt Park is finally moving forward. On Tuesday the city's Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards signed off on the plan for 1317 N. Western Avenue and sent it to the full City Council for final zoning approval. The upcoming five-story development, which comes from Gibbons Construction Service and Jonathan Splitt Architects, calls for 38 two- and three-bedroom condominiums priced between $400,000 and $500,000. The ground floor will contain garage parking for 32 cars accessed via a rear alleyway and two commercial storefronts offering nearly 6,000 square feet of combined retail space.  The project won the support of local groups including the Wicker Park Committee and East Humboldt Park Neighborhood Association late last year, and Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st) endorses the plan. A group of neighbors living on the 1300 block of North Claremont Street have spoken out against the development over concerns of potential traffic congestion in the alleyway, Block Club Chicago reported.  At Tuesday's meeting, Ald. La Spata said he was particularly proud of the six units of on-site affordable housing included in the plan. The alderman said he expects the affordable units will be priced at or below $225,000 and that the units will be kept affordable for the next 30 years, even if the properties change hands.  ",Wicker Park,0.0

Committee on Design reviews Woodlawn Social,"The Committee on Design has reviewed Woodlawn Social. Chosen as the winner of the Woodlawn RFQ process back in May, the project site is a plot of vacant, city-owned land on E. 63rd St between S. Ellis Ave and S. Greenwood Ave. POAH, KMW Communities and Tandem Ventures are the developers behind the winning proposal. Designed by Koning Eizenberg and HED, the design began as a chance to make a neighborhood town square for Woodlawn featuring a new model of housing in Chicago that introduces a cross grain, breaking down the street wall and turning the residential massings to sit perpendicular to the street. This configuration creates a scale of development that maintains sunlight on the street and gives all units ample access to light and air. While looking like a series of buildings, the development only envisions two individual structures for the site. The larger building will stand six stories tall and hold 60 rental units divided up into 36 one-beds, 16 two-beds, and 8 three-beds. Its ground floor will hold 8,500 square feet of retail that faces onto a 9,000 square foot public plaza. To the west, a smaller four-story building holds 10 for-sale townhomes that will include 5 two-bed and 5 three-bedroom configurations. Residents of the buildings will have access to 10,000 square feet of outdoor space separate from the public plaza. 26 parking spaces will be lined up against the alley at the back of the building. The residential masses above the ground floor split the double-loaded corridor configuration into thinner bars that are more contextual to the smaller residential typologies of the area. The projecting and cantilevering volumes exhibit a faceted facade overlooking the plaza and use the same staggered cantilever expression at the back of the building overlooking the alley and residential neighborhood to the south.  The public plaza works to create a sense of place and community as it is large enough to be inviting and offer a space for rest while being activated by landscaping and vibrant retail space looking onto it. While not part of the scope of this project, the design team envisioned using the parcel across the street to build upon the public plaza idea and create an even larger outdoor space to help anchor this area as a community hub. Among a number of city objectives, the innovative project takes sustainability to the next level, designing in an energy and ecologically conscious way to try and achieve the Living Building Challenge. Along with a myriad of other efforts, the structure will be topped with solar panels to help with energy generation. The discussion opened with Philip Enquist, who praised the project as a great addition to the 63rd Street corridor. Asking about the south facade, Enquist clarified with the design team that the building does overhang the new alley extension at the rear of the property. Asking about the parking spaces along the alley, the design team clarified that they are studying a mix of secured, enclosed parking spaces for residents and open, easy access spaces for workers and retail patrons. Enquist’s final comments were about the focus of retail space towards the east versus the west and the design team responded that their current organization allows for the retail to orient itself more towards the nearby school, keeping the townhomes near the finer residential grain towards the south while also allowing the public plaza to align with the potential open space on the parcel to the north. Catherine Baker spoke next and commented how she loved the broken-down massing and acknowledgement of getting sun onto the southern side of the street. Baker next posed a question about how the townhomes worked, upon which the design team clarified that the townhome structure is essentially a series of two-story townhomes stacked two homes high, creating a four-story building. The bottom townhome will get a front stoop and patio facing the street as well as some outdoor space at the back, while the upper homes will get a private rooftop deck.  Andre Brumfield chimed in next and asked about how much the buildings would be overhanging the alley to the south. The design team clarified that their overhangs are within the property line and the section of alley discussed is actually a private driveway on the project site that currently does not exist and is proposed as a way to extend the alley and provide access to parking spots and loading zones. Eleanor Gorski wrapped up the commenting period by asking about the building materials and whether the team has anticipated potential alternatives in case value engineering has to happen later on down the road. The design team responded that they have discussed alternatives including doing a panelized brick system for the facade system, but ensured that while individual materials may be changed, the fundamental strategy and design intent of the currently shown materials would stay in place regardless of any potential value engineering. With input received from the committee, the development team and DPD will review and take the comments into consideration as the project moves forward. If the project seeks any zoning relief or city financing, it will need to go through the city’s formal review process before commencing construction. ",Woodlawn,1.0

Obama Presidential Center scores full building permits,"Full building permits have been issued for the Obama Presidential Center. Spanning from E. 59th Street to E. 62nd Street and bound by S. Stony Island Avenue to the west, the complex will take over a parcel of land inside Jackson Park, adjacent to the Midway Plaisance. Planned by The Obama Foundation, the center will feature multiple buildings designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, with landscape design by Michael van Valkenburgh Associates. The first building will be a museum, rising 235 feet in a stone-sheathed tower. Addressed at 6001 S. Stony Island Avenue, its form is inspired by the idea of four hands coming together, embodying the concept of ascension. The 12-story museum will be topped by the Sky Room, a space that will offer visitors views of Lake Michigan, downtown, and the rest of the South Side. The second building on the campus will be the Forum. Addressed at 6011 S. Stony Island Avenue, the building will welcome visitors and the community. Rising a modest two floors, it will be home to an auditorium, a broadcast and recording studio, flexible learning/meeting spaces, and a restaurant. A public plaza will connect the museum tower and forum structure. The final piece of the complex will be a new library building, holding a Chicago Public Library branch. The two-story structure will contain digital media spaces and amenities for children, informational and vocational resources for adults, and a reading room for everyone to utilize. The building, addressed at 6021 S Stony Island Avenue, will be topped by a roof garden. A parking structure at 6101 S Stony Island Avenue was also permitted in this batch of permits. It allows for the construction of a one-story lower-level parking structure for visitors. The rest of the campus will be a series of outdoor spaces that combine into a larger park space for the center. It will offer play areas, walking paths, a sledding hill, and a long pedestrian promenade to join the campus to Jackson Park. The historic Women’s Garden will be restored with plantings, pathways, and seating before the center opens.  The reported $830 million center broke ground in October of 2021, with Barack and Michelle Obama attending alongside Governor J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot. With work already underway on the caissons, the full building permits will allow work to continue on site.

Obama Presidential Center officially breaks ground ,"After years of planning—and fending off lawsuits—the Obama Presidential Center is officially under construction on Chicago's South Side. On Tuesday, former First Lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama joined Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker to break ground on the transformative project. ""This day's been a long time coming,"" the 44th president remarked at Tuesday's groundbreaking ceremony. ""We are here today on the South Side of Chicago in Jackson Park to officially break ground on the Obama Presidential Center. We choose this location for a few pretty good reasons. It's close to where Michelle grew up, where I started my political career. It is surrounded by vibrant neighborhoods and a community where we believe we can help make a difference."" Designed by New York-based firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, the center is envisioned not as a static repository for documents and memorabilia but as a 19-acre campus that will become ""the world's premier institution for developing civic leaders,"" according to the former president. The facility will be home to ""concerts, cultural events, lectures, summits, topical dialogs, and conversations,"" Obama said. Plans call for a 235-foot-tall museum tower, an athletic facility, an underground parking garage, a community garden, a test kitchen, restored wetlands, and a sledding hill. ""We want the Obama Presidential Center to change Chicago for the better. This center will support thousands of jobs during and after construction, many of them right here on the South Side. It will spark economic growth in this community by bringing as many as 750,000 visitors to this area every single year. Visitors who will eat, shop, explore and spend money, strengthening the South Side and making it a more attractive place for businesses to grow and to hire."" The Obama Foundation announced in 2015 that the center would be constructed on the South Side of Chicago and selected the Jackson Park site the following year. Zoning for the Obama Presidential Center was approved by the city in 2018 and the project's organizers planned to break ground later that year and open the center in 2021. The timeline for the estimated $830 million development has slipped and is now expected to open in 2025. The multi-year delay was partly caused by a federal review of the center and its impact on the historic Jackson Park landscaped, which was designed in 1871 by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. The project also faced ongoing legal challenges from open space activists. Even as the Obamas and other VIPs attended Tuesday's groundbreaking ceremony, a single-engine aircraft circled above Jackson Park with a banner reading ""stop cutting down trees move OPC.""  Pre-construction work has been underway since this summer on transportation, utility, and other infrastructure improvements as well as a replacement for the running track the center will displace. Although the project will close the six-lane Cornell Drive thoroughfare that cuts through the park and replace it with green space, other roadways near the center are being widened at the expense of old-growth trees. The nearby Woman's Garden, also known as the Perennial Garden in Jackson Park, designed by May McAdams in 1937 was recently scraped clean to make way for the center.  ""The [project] will also preserve and enhance all the things that make Jackson Park special,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""We will reunify parkland, plant new trees, and provide new habitats for birds and wildlife. We are also going to open this park up to the community, creating a community rec center, another branch of the Chicago Public Library, creating new spaces for folks from the South Side and all over the city to gather, and to connect, and to learn.""

Mixed-income apartments pitched near Cottage Grove Green Line station,"In Woodlawn, a joint venture between Chicago-based DL3 Realty and co-developer The Michaels Organization is seeking city approval for a five-story, mixed-income housing development at the southeast corner of 63rd Street and Maryland Avenue.  Designed by FitzGerald Associates Architects, the proposed building calls for 56 dwelling units offered in one-, two- and three-bedroom floorplans, a pair of ground-floor live-work units targeting entrepreneurs, and roughly 3,400 square feet of retail space fronting 63rd street. A rear parking lot will provide 32 spaces for residential use plus 8 spaces reserved for retail customers.   Forty-one of the units will be offered as affordable housing: nine units for households earning no more than 30 percent Area Median Income (AMI), nine units at 50 percent AMI, and 23 apartments at 60 percent AMI. The remaining units will be rented at market rate. The development team intends to apply for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and other financial assistance, according to the project's zoning application.  The site is currently a vacant city-owned lot and is located across the street from the 70-unit mixed-income Woodlawn Station housing development, which opened in 2018. DL3 and Michaels are seeking to rezone the property from B3-3 Community Shopping District to a Residential Business Planned Development. The proposal is scheduled to go before the Chicago Plan Commission on August 19. ",Woodlawn,0.0
Obama Presidential Center scores construction permits,"After landing its first batch of construction permits, Chicago's upcoming Obama Presidential Center is one step closer to breaking ground in Jackson Park. On Monday, the city issued a trio of permits for foundation work at the addresses 6011, 6021, and 6101 S. Stoney Island Avenue. The scope of the work also includes ""tree removal and site clearing,"" according to the permits.  The newly issued permits represent a key milestone leading up to the official groundbreaking date, which is scheduled for August 16. In April, the Obama Foundation announced the start of pre-construction work including efforts to relocate utility lines as well as preliminary work to close and widen several adjacent roadways. Designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, the long-discussed presidential center will be a major addition to the historic Jackson Park landscape conceived in 1871 by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. The plan calls for an imposing 235-foot-tall stone museum building, a new Chicago Public Library branch, a public plaza, an athletic facility, an underground parking garage, and a community garden.  Zoning for the center was approved by the city in 2018 and organizers had hoped to begin construction later that same year. The project faced numerous delays related to a lengthy federal historic review process as well as multiple lawsuits from park advocacy groups.   The estimated $700 million facility is currently facing fresh legal action from Protect Our Parks, which is aiming to block construction because they say the project would ""permanently destroy"" the integrity of Jackson Park. Any further delays would add $2.2 million to the center's price tag each month, according to a court filing from the Obama Foundation reported by Crain's. The project is expected to take roughly four years to complete. ",Woodlawn,0.0
"As pre-construction work begins, Obama Presidential Center faces new lawsuit","On Wednesday, state and local officials including Gov. Pritzker and Mayor Lightfoot assembled in Jackson Park to announce the start of preliminary construction work on the Obama Presidential Center. Although groundbreaking on the center itself isn't expected until the latter part of the year, pre-construction work—such as relocating utility lines plus the closing and widening of several adjacent roadways—is a key step in the process. ""The set of investments we are making in tandem with the development of the Obama Presidential Center will not only help to kickstart our economy, but spur the inclusive economic growth we need to rise above this pandemic by uplifting our historic South Side,"" Lightfoot said in a statement. In a tweet, former President Barack Obama said that he and his wife Michelle are ""thrilled to be one step closer"" to bringing the project to Chicago's South Side. ""I'm looking forward to grabbing a hard hat and a shovel and officially breaking ground in Jackson Park in the fall,"" said Obama in a video released Wednesday.   However, the same day that officials marked the start of preliminary construction work, nonprofit group Protect Our Parks filed a fresh lawsuit aimed at blocking construction. The group was behind an earlier lawsuit challenging the legality of handing over parkland to a private entity such as the Obama Foundation, and its latest legal complaint makes a similar argument. The new suit also alleges that the center will ""permanently destroy"" the integrity of Jackson Park, and that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review completed earlier this year was in violation of federal laws.  ""It seems to me that the obvious resolution is just to require a reconsideration that considers alternative locations,"" Protect Our Parks president Herb Caplan told the Hyde Park Herald. ""In other words, just do the entire NEPA review all over again, but not limiting it solely to considering Jackson Park, but considering other locations."" In a statement reported by the Chicago Tribune, the Obama Foundation said it was ""prepared to vigorously defend against this lawsuit"" and that the organization still anticipates ""groundbreaking in the fall of this year."" Designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, the Obama Presidential Center includes a 235-foot-tall museum building, a new Chicago Public Library branch, an athletic facility, an underground parking garage, a plaza, and a community garden.  Zoning for the controversial development was approved by the city in 2018. At that time, the center's organizers said they planned to break ground that year. Already delayed at least three years, the center is expected to take four years to complete.  ",Woodlawn,0.0

"DraftKings Sportsbook set to open next week, but without betting","The DraftKings Sportsbook under construction at Wrigley Field will open to the public next Tuesday, June 27th, albeit without sports betting as the team awaits approval from the Illinois Gaming Board. Led by Marquee Development, DraftKings, and Levy, the two-story structure is located at the corner of W. Addison St and N. Sheffield Ave, adjacent to the ballpark but not directly linked. With sports betting still awaiting approval, the team is expecting to draw customers with the massive 2,000 square foot video board that hovers above the bar and can show up to 25 sports games at once. With a two-story space, tables on the ground floor are available for walk-ins or reservations with seating options including bar seating, high-top tables, or booths. The upper floor mezzanine will hold more theater-style seating overlooking the bar and video board while also including rentable group spaces that include designated TVs that can be programmed with the groups preferred sports games.  Talking with Shawn Fawell, Project Manager for Gensler, the sportsbook has been designed so that there is truly no bad seat in the house. “Every detail was highly considered with a focus on an incredible viewing experience, from the positioning of the screens to the comfortable seating options sports fans need to settle in for a game,” Fawell said. With Wrigley Field’s standing as a National and Chicago landmark, the architecture was highly coordinated to meet the historic guidelines of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, National Park Service, and State Historic Preservation Office. The result is a contemporary structure that references the historic ballpark with its green steel elements while incorporating a substantial amount of glass to create a transparent, airy feel.  With the venue opening to customers next week, food and beverage service will include a menu of American bar fare with elevated and unique twists. Crafted by Levy, the Cubs’ hospitality partner, signature dishes will include the House Smoked Pastrami Sandwich, the Colossal Hot Dog, and a Prime Rib Sandwich. The bar service will include 10 signature selections on tap, with further wine and spirits offerings. All guests must be 21 years of age or older to enter the Sportsbook. In terms of sports betting at the venue, a DraftKings representative couldn't provide specifics on the timing of when approvals are expected, but they must go before the Illinois Gaming Board to receive the necessary permissions before sports betting could begin.  ",Wrigleyville,0.0
