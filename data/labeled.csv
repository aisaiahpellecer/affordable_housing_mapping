Developer revises apartment proposal for Chicago Joe's site in North Center,"Landrosh Development is back with a new, denser proposal for the former site of Chicago Joe's restaurant just six weeks after Ald. Matt Martin (47th) denied an earlier plan to construct 8 condos at the North Center site. ""I think what we heard loud and clear [about the previous design] was that we lacked density,"" said developer Patrick Landrosh at a virtual community meeting on Thursday evening. ""We also lacked a significant amount of affordable housing, and you'll see that this proposal is very different."" Dubbed the Irving Oakley Apartments, the updated project at 2250-56 W. Irving Park Road rises five stories and includes five studios, 18 one-bedrooms, and 17 two-bedroom rental units. Four of the 40 apartments will be set aside as below-market-rate housing for residents earning 60 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). On the ground floor, an additional four affordable units will double as live-work suites with dedicated commercial spaces for renters earning 100 percent AMI. ""We wanted to create an entrepreneurial affordable housing component that allows folks to run a business and have a commercial presence on a main arterial street that would otherwise not be financially feasible,"" explained Landrosh.  Designed by Sullivan, Goulette & Wilson Architects, the revised building features outdoor balconies and is clad in brick and metal panels. The renderings presented at Thursday's meeting were rough massing models that illustrate the size and shape of the proposed development but lack exterior detailing.  As a transit-oriented development, the building will provide garage parking for 16 to 18 vehicles accessed off the alleyway plus parking for 40 bicycles. The development team will need to rezone part of the property from B1-1 to B2-3 and go before the Zoning Board of Appeals for a variance to reduce side yard setback requirements. The 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Council will review the plans for the Irving Oakley Apartments and provide an eventual recommendation to Ald. Martin. The alderman's office will also collect feedback from the community before taking an official position on the North Center project.  ",North Center,1
ZBA approves residential conversion at 153 W. Ohio,"The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a special use application for the planned conversion of a five-story brick commercial building at 153 W. Ohio into residential units. Planned by Chicago developer Senco Properties, the existing building is located midblock between N. LaSalle St and N. Wells St.  With FitzGerald in charge of the architecture, the building will be infilled with 35 residential units. The newly renovated building will contain a mix of 5 studios, 11 one-beds, 6 one-bed pluses, 11 two-beds, and 2 three-beds. With zero parking in the building, residents will have access to 38 bike parking spaces in the basement.  While extensive interior work will be done, the exterior will see minimal changes to the exterior entryway and rooftop, with the building height remaining unchanged. The top floor units will be the only units to have balconies, while all residents will have access to a fitness center in the basement.  The ground floor will have the residential lobby and mailroom as well as two studios, a one-bed plus and a three-bed unit.  The Zoning Board of Appeals has approved a special use application to allow for residential use on the ground floor of the development. With approval secured, the development can move forward with permitting and construction. ",River North,0
Zoning application submitted for residential addition at 167 N. Racine,"A zoning application has been filed for a proposed mixed-use development at 167 N. Racine. Planned by Marduk Management, the project site is located midblock between W. Lake St and W. Randolph St. The property is currently occupied by two four-story masonry buildings that were combined at some point to connect as one building.  Designed by SPACE Architects + Planners, the development will reorganize the office space on the existing floors and add two floors of residential units above the northern building. On the ground floor, a new accessible lobby will be added to connect with new stairs and an elevator. Office space will occupy the first through fourth floors, with a shared rooftop deck on the southern half of the fifth floor. Rising 78 feet, the two-story addition will be clad in a black aluminum cladding. The eight new apartments will be split into four one-beds, two two-beds, and two three-beds. With the same layout on both floors, the three-beds will face N. Racine St, the two-beds will face east, and the one-beds will face north. All units will have private balconies. Due to the existing buildings occupying the entire site, no on-site parking will be provided. Eight bike parking spaces will be provided. The developer is seeking to rezone the site from C1-2 to DX-5. According to the development team, the best-case scenario for the project’s timeline would be to gain approval by the end of the year, receive permits in March 2024, and break ground late Spring 2024.

Twelve luxury apartments headed to vacant lot in Oakland,"Developer Jennings Realty is close to breaking ground on a four-level, 12-unit luxury apartment project at 4012 S. Ellis Avenue, the company revealed at a virtual meeting hosted by Ald. Sophia King (4th) and the North Kenwood-Oakland Advisory Council (NKOAC).   Designed by Alexander Polichuk Architects, the upcoming project replaces a vacant lot in the Oakland community within Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood. The masonry and limestone structure will contain six one-bedrooms renting for around $1,500 per month and six two-bedroom units starting at $2,000. The largest apartments will be ""duplex-downs"" occupying the first and lower levels.  The plan includes residential balconies on the front and rear of the new building plus a large rooftop deck. Every apartment will have 9-foot ceilings and finishes ""consistent with what is being developed as single-family homes and condominiums,"" said Ivan Mariduena of Jennings Realty. The development team intends to hold the South Side property long-term, according to Mariduena.  The development also calls for a detached, single-story rear garage structure with parking for 12 cars. Some neighbors attending the virtual NKOAC meeting, however, questioned if one space per apartment was adequate off-street parking since half of the proposed residences will have two bedrooms each. The project slated for 4012 S. Ellis is not seeking a zoning change or financial assistance from the city and therefore is not required to provide any below-market-rate units. The developers said they are close to finalizing their architectural drawings and hope to apply for permits and break ground soon. ",Oakland,0
Committee on Design reviews The Ave,"The Committee on Design has reviewed The Ave. Chosen as the winner back at the end of 2021, The Ave will occupy the RFP site along W. Chicago Ave between N. Central Park Ave and N. Monticello Ave, where it will replace the current Neighborhood Housing Services office and a one-story commercial building currently owned by the city.  Planned by KMW Communities, POAH and CEC, the four-story project will include 49 affordable apartments, 2,900 square feet of space for Neighborhood Housing Services, an innovation center measuring 2,900 square feet, and 1,800 square feet of available retail space. The building’s unit mix will consist of 19 one-beds, 27 two-beds, and 3 three-beds. Parking for 32 cars will be included on the ground floor. With Gensler and Nia Architects working on the project, the design began with the intent to avoid a simple bar building. The current scheme looks to create a longer building with multiple components. The massing holds the corners at each intersection, carves the middle of the street frontage, and draws the eye into the center plaza space.  The portion along N. Central Park Ave is the tallest portion, creating a stronger presence on one corner. The longer portion of the building is shorter and stretches towards N. Monticello Ave. Dubbed The Stoop, the public space at the center will be the feature space of the project. With Site Design Group on the project, the plaza will be designed as a multi-use space that will be overlooked by a large screen wall that will house local artwork. Since being selected as the winner of the RFP, the design has changed due to program changes and affordability measures. The top floor of the taller volume was removed, and the NHS office space was moved from two floors of space in the taller volume over to the ground floor of the shorter volume. New residential units were added to the second floor of the taller volume. Rising 49 feet, removing the fifth floor will allow for a less expensive construction method that will make the project more affordable. The building will be clad in a gridded brick facade with wood veneer accent panels and aluminum windows. At the ground floor, angled walls will also be clad in brick. Second floor residential units will have balconies that overlook the street and plaza. The discussion opened with Lesley Roth who liked the geometry of the building but commented that the angled walls needed refinement. Roth followed up with a comment that the second-floor facade still looks like office fenestration and needs to be coordinated with the new residential program behind it.  Sara Beardsley chimed in next to comment that the treatment of the massing was subtle but interesting and thought the feature wall was really nice. Beardsley said that the fortress-like walls at the ground floor could use more refinement. Brian Lee spoke next, asking if the design team considered having the parking garage access be from the alley. The development team responded that they did look at it but opted for a curb cut on N. Central Park Ave due to some concerns about overloading the alley which currently serves the residential neighborhood of single-family homes and two-flats. Lee felt the building was a good example of a well-planned mixed-use development and asked if they considered building taller to get more units. The development team said that 44 units was the original target (the building will now hold 49), and when the program was refined, they were able to fit everything in four floors and use a more affordable construction type.  Renauld Mitchell echoed the sentiments of the others and felt the project was well thought out. Mitchell asked whether the second-floor balconies were a remnant of the earlier scheme or if the intent was to preserve the look now that it is residential. The design team responded that they liked the reveal between the ground floor and upper floors, but it was a fair comment that it needs to look less commercial. With the Committee on Design review complete, the project will continue through the DPD review process. The project is reportedly proceeding under the existing zoning designation but will need city approval for acquiring the city-owned land and if the project ends up requesting city funding. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Humboldt Park,1
919 W. Fulton scores foundation permit,"After securing $233 million in construction financing just last week, developers Fulton Street Cos. and JDL Development are wasting no time getting shovels in the ground for Chicago’s newest office development at 919 W. Fulton. Planned for a rectangular site along N. Sangamon St spanning from W. Fulton St to W. Lake St, the project scope also includes an existing building at 910 W. Lake that will be reworked. As a rare accomplishment amidst waning demand for office space, the 400,000 square foot building is set to become home to the headquarters of Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, who will occupy 112,000 square feet of space in the 11-story building. On the ground floor, Gibsons Restaurant Group will occupy 15,500 square feet of the planned retail space. 65 car parking spaces will be included in an underground parking level. Designed by Morris Adjmi Architects and FitzGerald, the 11-story building features a facade that was designed to fit into the historic context and exhibits a series of notches and setbacks as it rises to reduce its visual impact on the historic Fulton-Randolph Market District that it will sit within. Originally planned to connect to the residential building at 910 W. Lake and convert it into more office space, the revised scope of the project will leave the existing building as apartments due to the stronger demand for residential.  With this foundation permit issued, general contractor Skender Construction can begin below-grade construction, including excavation work and mechanicals underground, and work on the partial superstructure up through level five. Further permits will allow the construction to continue through completion, which is targeted for 2025. ",Fulton Market,0
City Council approves 1649 N. Halsted,"The Chicago City Council has approved the mixed-use development planned at 1649 N. Halsted. Led by Draper and Kramer, the project will replace the shuttered Royal George Theater and adjacent four-story structure to the south. The former theater space is now considered obsolete as it has been marketed to other theater companies including Steppenwolf and ultimately the size, capacity, and configuration in a post-COVID era make it undesirable to continue using it as a theater. With SGW Architecture and Design in charge of the architecture, the building will stand eight floors high with a ninth partial floor that will hold amenity space and connect to an outdoor roof deck. Providing 131 rental units, the project’s unit mix will consist of 12 studios, 91 one-beds, 26 two beds and 2 three beds. Out of those units, 20 will be affordable with a mix of 2 studios, 14 one-beds, and 4 two-beds. To satisfy the remaining obligation of 6.2 units, Draper and Kramer will pay a fee in-lieu of $940,000. Inspired by the theater past of the site and vibrant theater community of the area, the front facade is a subtle allusion to a theater curtain, folding the glass wall to create a rippling effect reinforced by the slab edge covers that reference a modern treatment of bay windows. To reduce the mass of the building, the eighth and ninth floors have been setback considerably from the street. After conversations with Alderman Hopkins and neighbors, brick masonry was added to the building’s design and replaced glazing at the ground floor. Vertical ribbons of terracotta rainscreen have been added in a color that will match the brick. At the ground floor, the residential entry will be located at the north end of the frontage, while the 4,500 square feet of retail space will occupy the rest of the frontage and feature a 13-foot setback to allow space for outdoor dining as the retail space is targeted for a restaurant operator. Parking for 34 cars and 131 bikes is located in an enclosed garage on the ground floor accessed from the alley. The development sought a rezoning from B3-2 to B3-5 with an overall Planned Development designation. Alderman Hopkins officially gave his approval of the project after a contentious two years of negotiations and community meetings that resulted in some of the aforementioned design changes as well as a $300,000 investment that will go towards expanding a city park at the corner of North and Larrabee. After the Chicago Plan Commission approved the $53 million development in August, the proposal received approval from the Committee on Zoning and now finally the City Council, allowing for the project to move forward with its full entitlements. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Lincoln Park,1
Dinkel’s Lofts gets revised design at 3327 N. Lincoln,"Developer PCR Group Chicago has revised its design for Dinkel’s Lofts, a mixed-use development at 3327 N. Lincoln. Planned for a V-shaped property, the site fronts both N. Lincoln Ave and N. Marshfield Ave and includes the historic Dinkel’s building and sign. Designed by Jonathan Splitt Architects, the new building will stand six stories, rising almost 80 feet tall. While three of the existing structures will be demolished, the project will retain the famous Dinkel’s Bakery facade and sign, building the new structure behind it. The revised design will retain the facade of the three-story brick building on the south side of the Dinkel’s building.  On the ground floor, the project’s residential lobby will be centered within the N. Lincoln Ave frontage. The retail space on the north side of the lobby has been increased from 2,725 square feet to 3,345 square feet. To the south of the lobby, the previously planned shared office amenity space has been removed and the bike storage room has been pushed further into the floor plate to create another retail space along the street, measuring 1,267 square feet. The parking garage has been reduced in size to now accommodate 15 cars instead of 20. Rising above, the second floor sets back from N. Marshfield Ave, giving select units private roof terraces. The residential component of the project will split the 42 units into 4 studios, 10 one-beds, 21 two-beds, and 7 three-beds, all spread across the second through sixth floors. Residents will have access to a shared roof deck as well as a fitness amenity space on the second floor.  To allow for the development, the developer is seeking to rezone the property from B1-2 to B3-3. According to the developer’s website, the project could have a 2024 delivery.  ",Lakeview,0
DePaul University gets permit to renovate Sullivan Athletic Center,"DePaul University has received permits to renovate the Sullivan Athletic Center and McGrath-Phillips Arena at 2323 N. Sheffield. As part of a larger athletics investment, the school is also looking to build a new practice facility for the school’s basketball teams.  Designed by Antunovich Associates and HNTB, the renovation will infill one of the three basketball courts with two stories of new athletic support space. The first floor of the facility will be dedicated to the health and wellness of all 215+ DePaul student athletes, and will include a team dining space, nutrition bar, new sports medicine treatment spaces and offices, hydrotherapy, a weight room, and multi-purpose meeting rooms. Across the street, the school is planning to clear the site of a series of vintage buildings to build a new basketball practice facility. The new facility would feature a brick façade that mirrors the aesthetic of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, with a pitched roof that pays homage to DePaul's former Lincoln Park arena, Alumni Hall. Floor-to-ceiling glass around the basketball gyms will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and wider city context. DePaul men’s and women’s basketball will move their training, practices, and operations into the building to allow for more dedicated spaces to support the programs.  With the permits issued for renovation, general contractor Bulley & Andrews can begin work inside the building. Work is set to begin this December, with the first phase being completed in late Summer 2024.  As the project moves forward, the demolition of buildings on the site across the street would not begin until Summer 2025 at the earliest as the proposal is seeking an amendment to the existing Planned Development for the campus. The amendment would need approval from Alderman Timmy Knudsen (43rd), the Chicago Plan Commission, the Committee on Zoning, and the full City Council. Construction of the new facility would begin after demolition is done and is expected to be completed by Fall 2026.  ",Lincoln Park,0
Foundation permit issued at 1723 S. Michigan,"A foundation and partial superstructure permit has been issued for a residential development at 1723 S. Michigan. Planned by Chicago-based CMK Companies, the project has progressed under the radar as it has not requested any zoning change or variances. Zoned DX-5, the extent of the project site isn’t fully clear but will sit across the street from CMK’s 1720 S. Michigan. With Gensler reportedly behind the architecture, the permit reports a 13-story building is set to rise on the property. The development will have 149 apartment units with 98 parking spaces on the first three floors. Retail space and the residential lobby will occupy the front of the ground floor with parking behind. With the foundation and partial superstructure permit issued, general contractor Brandts Build LLC can begin working on the structure for the first through second floor and build the core, concrete stairs and walls to the underside of the sixth floor. A full building permit has been filed and is awaiting issuance. ",South Loop,0
Developer pivots from condos to bathhouse at 1010 W. Madison,"Developer Fulton Street Cos. has scrapped plans for a 10-story condominium development in favor of a two-story bathhouse. Located at the northwest corner of W. Madison St and N. Morgan St, the 17,000-square-foot site is currently a surface parking lot. Designed by Gensler, the new scheme envisions a 40,000 square foot, two-story spa set to be occupied by New York-based Bathhouse. The building is set to include a rooftop restaurant and pool. Renderings show a concrete structure with arched bays filled in with opaque glazing. The scheme is a distinct shift from the ten-story condo building, a sign of the struggling condo market in the city. If it had been built, the condo building would have had 25 homes, priced from $2 million to $6 million. With the build-to-suit-lease planned with Bathhouse, construction could begin as soon as the beginning of 2024 with opening targeted for Spring 2025. ",West Loop,0
LaSalle Reimagined: 135 S. LaSalle,"With six finalists for the LaSalle Reimagined presenting their plans to the community, Urbanize is breaking it down by proposal to highlight the design and benefits of each one as the city considers which three to name as winners.  Plagued with vacancies, the corridor is littered with empty historic office buildings that no longer meet the current market demands of new office tenants. Originally announced at the end of September 2022, Mayor Lightfoot and the Department of Planning and Development are offering city funding for proposals along the LaSalle Street corridor. Public resources are expected to include federal tax credits, Cook County property tax incentives, TIF funding, PACE financing, Low Income Housing Tax Credits and other tools. With a large focus on housing and specifically affordable housing, all proposals must include 30% affordable housing to receive the city support. Located at 135 S. LaSalle, the Field Building is set to be converted into a new mixed-use hub along the corridor. Proposed by Riverside Investment and Development and AmTrustRE, the 1934 tower currently holds 1.2 million square feet and is a city landmark. With the departure of Bank of America in 2020, the building has 900,000 square feet of empty space ready to be repurposed. With Solomon Cordwell Buenz on board as the architect, the building will receive a full restoration of the facade, restoration of the arcades at the base of the building, and windows will be replaced. Vinci Hamp Architects will be consulting on the historic portions of the redesign.  The planned rehab is limited to floors 15 and below, which will be reactivated with 430 residential units and 80,000 square feet of retail space on the first two floors. New residential lobbies will be located at S. LaSalle St and S. Clark St, north of the historic main arcade that runs through the ground floor. The beginning of the retail space will be on the south side of the arcade fronting W. Adams St. The second floor spans 30,000 square feet and was vacated by Bank of America, offering a large space that could become an event space or could house a potential grocer. The original banking hall space has unique features including 16-foot ceilings and a 7,000 square foot area of column-free space. Teaming up with Bluestar Properties for the retail programming, the development team is targeting a grocery tenant to take about 15,000-25,000 square feet of the retail space.  Above the retail space, floors three and four would be converted into 180 parking spaces. With plans to set the spaces back from the windows with walls to hide the cars from the public view, these spaces are deemed vital to the leasing efforts of the retail space especially for attracting a grocery tenant. These parking spaces would be shared with residents, who would also have access to 400+ bike parking spaces. On the residential floors, the original building's layout is no longer conducive to office use but is very well suited to a residential layout. Measuring 40,000 square feet, the floor plate’s quadrant layout allows for an abundance of light and air even in the urban core. These floors will hold 254 studios, 116 one-beds, and 60 two-beds, with 30%, or 129, of them set aside as affordable. Set to cost $258 million, the project would be funded with $115 million in TIF, $34 million in Historic Tax Credits, $30 million from a sponsor/3rd party, and $78 million in debt. With no leasing encumbrances, this is a shovel-ready project. If selected, design would take 9-12 months, then construction would begin in 2024, with the building opening to residents in Q1 2025. The city is currently reviewing the six proposals and plans to select up to three of the finalists to receive city financing. Once that decision is made by the end of month, the city will go through an underwriting process that will take a few months. The proposals will then need approval from the Community Development Commission and City Council for the appropriation of the city funding.  ",The Loop,1
Plan Commission approves music venue at 1675 N. Elston,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved plans for a new music and entertainment venue at 1675 N. Elston. Located in the North Branch Industrial Corridor, the property was previously a nightclub that got shut down. The existing two-story masonry building on the site will get rehabbed by developer 1675 Holdings LLC who bought the property in 2018 with the intention of re-envisioning the site as a new venue space. Dubbed The Outset, the new entertainment venue will retain the existing two-story masonry building while enlivening the facade with a new mural. On the street-facing elevation, two new windows and an egress door will puncture the currently solid wall and add some transparency along the street. Visitors will enter the property through the adjacent open space before entering the building from the south. Outside, a large outdoor patio will feature extensive landscaping, a center water feature, a food truck parked along the back of the property, and bathroom facilities for patrons. This outdoor space will be screened from the street with a black steel fence with landscaping in front of it. With a relatively small site for the industrial corridor, no car parking is required, and the plan will not provide any. The developer expects most visitors to arrive via rideshare, public transit, biking, or walking. There will be 17 on-site bike parking spaces and the Elston bike lane will be raised up to the sidewalk level and placed inside of the parking lane to avoid door slams from cars stopping to drop people off. The development will also include the addition of 5 more bikes to the existing Divvy station on W. Wabansia Ave.  To allow for the project, the developer is seeking to rezone the property from M3-3 to C2-1 with an overall Planned Development designation. With Chicago Plan Commission approval, the $2 million development will now head to City Hall to receive its final approvals from the Committee on Zoning and full City Council.  ",North Branch,0
Ogden Commons Phase 2 secures financing,"Chicago-based The Habitat Company announced that it has secured financing for Phase 2 at Ogden Commons, a $200 million mixed-use, mixed-income project. Located in North Lawndale, the project is bounded by W. Ogden Ave to the south, S. Fairfield Ave to the west and S. Rockwell St to the east. Developed by The Habitat Company, along with Sinai Health System, Alecko Capital, and the City of Chicago, Ogden Commons is the city’s largest opportunity zone project and was conceived to bring much-needed housing, retail and critical outpatient health services to Chicago’s historically underserved West Side. With financing in place, construction has started on OC Living’s first phase, a 92-unit building that will consist of 90% affordable apartments with the remainder market-rate. Located at 1325 S. Washtenaw, the four-story rental building will offer a mix of 23 studios, 60 one-bedrooms and nine two-bedroom apartments.  The building’s outdoor amenities will include an enclosed rubber-surfaced children’s tot lot with play structures, bike racks, a lighted on-site walking path, landscaped lawn and 110 parking stalls. Indoor amenities, located on the building’s first floor, include package and mail rooms, management and social services offices, a fitness center and bike room. The new residential building will be just steps from Ogden Commons’ three-story commercial building that marked Phase 1 of the 10-acre development and was completed in 2021. The 30,000 square-foot commercial building includes a Wintrust Bank, Momentum Coffee and Sinai Health System’s One Lawndale Express Care Clinic. “We are overjoyed by the positive feedback and impact Ogden Commons is already having on the North Lawndale community in the short amount of time since the opening of the commercial building and Sinai’s outpatient health facilities,” said Matt Fiascone, president of The Habitat Company. “With the first residential building breaking ground, we are now one step closer to fulfilling our vision of a multi-faceted, mixed-use community that combines essential healthcare, housing, retail and office space in one location, while creating new employment opportunities and boosting the local economy.” The residential building is scheduled to be delivered by Spring 2024, with McHugh Construction and Bowa Construction serving as general contractors. Built over multiple phases, the entire project is scheduled to be complete by 2026. ",North Lawndale,1
City Council approves rezoning at 115 S. Francisco,"The Chicago City Council has approved a mixed-use development at 115 S. Francisco. Located in East Garfield Park, the project site is a corner lot at the northeastern corner of S. Francisco Ave and W. Wilcox St. Currently a vacant lot, Black Light Fellowship will be developing the property. Set to rise 38 feet tall, the new mixed-use building will stand three stories tall and be clad in brick masonry. On the ground floor, 5,600 square feet of retail space will be occupied by administrative offices for a book publishing company. The upper two floors will have 8 two-bedroom apartments, accessed via the residential entry on S. Francisco Ave. The project will have zero car parking spaces and provide at least eight bike parking spaces. With City Council approval, the site will be rezoned from RT-4 to C1-3, allowing for the development to move forward. Permits for the new construction have not been filed yet and a timeline is currently unknown. ",East Garfield Park,
Jefferson Park condo plan fails to impress alderman,"The local alderman in Jefferson Park has asked the developer behind a low-rise condominium proposal to redesign their plans for a second time after their latest plan received complaints from community members.  Hudson Construction Services initially proposed a four-story project with a total of 24 units for the former United Methodist Church at 5850 N. Elston Avenue on Chicago's northwest side. Although the scope of the development was later reduced to a three-story complex with 18 for-sale units and 24 parking spaces, neighbors were still unsatisfied. At an in-person community meeting hosted last week by Ald. James Gardiner (45th), residents railed against the revised proposal, calling it too dense, too tall, and not providing enough on-site parking. More than 50 people attended the meeting yet only one individual spoke in favor of the development, according to Block Club Chicago. On Friday, Ald. Gardiner said in his newsletter that he will not support the latest plan and has requested the developers to go back to the drawing board. ""Based on community feedback, I have asked the developer for 5850 N. Elston to submit another proposal that will be more accepting from residents of our community,"" said Gardiner. ""Stay tuned."" The development team sought a zoning change from RS-3 to a B2-2, which would require Gardiner's support. The 24,500-square-foot property at 5850 N. Elston has been up for sale for over a year. The United Methodist Church shut down its Jefferson Park facility after merging with another church. ",Jefferson Park,0
Park District looks to revamp Grant Park framework,"The Chicago Park District opened their community engagement process for the revamp of the Grant Park Framework Plan. Dubbed ‘Chicago’s Front Yard Reimagined’ the effort looks to revisit and update the 2002 Grant Park Framework Plan that is now over 20 years old. Dating back to 1835, Grant Park was originally made to preserve green space from the rapid development occurring in the city. Assembling a large team, the Chicago Park District has brought on UrbanWorks, APMonarch, Confluence, Brush Architects, WSSCG, and Engage Civil. Tasked with creating a comprehensive vision, the new framework plan will outline short- and long-term goals while creating a guide to evaluate future proposals and ideas. This vision will focus on the next 20 years after the previous plan reshaped Grant Park in the last 20 years.  The overall project has four phases. Already complete, the first phase lasted from March until June 2022, working on site verification and program analysis. Currently in Phase 2, this phase is the public engagement portion, beginning back in July 2022 and lasting until July 2023. While public feedback is being received, Phase 3 will begin this month. Lasting until August 2023, this phase will be the design and plan development portion of the project. After Phase 3, the project will be finalized between September 2023 and December 2023, where the final framework plan and report document will be drafted and implemented.  Presenting to the community yesterday, the meeting was the kickoff for the public engagement process of the overall framework plan revamp. While this is the beginning of open public engagement, the Chicago Park District has already been working with a group of stakeholders to identify early priorities. Overall themes from the stakeholder engagement have been preservation and landscape, recreation, events, safety and logistics, and mobility. In the realm of preservation and landscape, common themes include making accessibility accommodations to the park’s historic elements, as well as making accommodations for all of the surrounding residents by adding a playground at the south end of the park and a dog park at the north end of the park.  For recreation, stakeholders have been interested in the park adjusting to current demands by skewing toward pickleball and soccer vs softball, for example. They would like to create more safe and effective spaces to accommodate activities that cater to seniors, while also helping children get involved with public art. Overall, the stakeholders expressed an interest in encouraging visitors of all ages from outside of the immediate area to come to the park.  In regard to events, stakeholders have given suggestions for improvements for events including dedicated staging areas, a system of secondary/service vehicle circulation (including golf carts), infrastructure for temporary stages, and barricade beautification. There have been shared values around minimizing restricted access to the park, keeping the park beautiful during events, “leaving no trace”, and respecting neighboring residents, businesses and institutions. For mobility, there has been the sense that once visitors reach the park, movement is mostly via bikes and walking which can limit access and exploration for certain groups such as families and seniors. Other means of transportation, such as more Divvy stations throughout, people movers, designated golf carts, and free shuttle paths were suggested.   The final theme was safety, where stakeholders brought up the idea that safety and security concerns should not target any specific groups. There was also discussion around the priority that should be given to addressing traffic concerns on Columbus Dr, Lake Shore Drive, and midblock pedestrian crossings at E. Balbo Dr, E. Monroe St, and E. Jackson Dr, with solutions such as speed tables, striped crossings, curb extensions, and limiting the use of those roads. The next steps for the project include three in-person public meetings that will happen this month and into February. After that, the framework will undergo design work before presenting the initial concept design to both stakeholders and another community meeting. After that, the plan will be finalized, presented once again, and finally implemented. ",The Loop,0
Chicago's first indoor track and field facility opens in Pullman,"In Pullman, James McHugh Construction and joint venture partner Bowa Construction have completed Chicago's first Olympic-grade indoor running track. Dubbed the Indoor Track & Field Center at Gately Park, the $53.67 million structure at 10201 S. Cottage Grove Avenue spans nearly 140,000 square feet. The Far South Side facility is home to the area's only hydraulically banked running oval which relies on movable cylinders to vary the angle of the turns. These banked sections of the track can lay flat to accommodate other uses including volleyball, basketball, and non-sporting events. ""This is only the 12th indoor hydraulically banked track of its kind in the U.S., so it was crucial to use the best trade partners to build the track system, which features a complicated series of jacks and pumps within pits at both ends of the track, and all supporting construction such as the super-flat concrete floors,"" said Andy Totten of McHugh Construction in a statement.  The new sports and recreation center was designed by Itasca, Illinois-based Williams Architects. The exterior is wrapped in an aluminum and glass curtainwall, brick-clad architectural precast concrete, traditional masonry veneer, and metal panels. To achieve a column-free layout, the structure's roof was constructed in six massive sections, each spanning 252 by 20 feet and weighing 120 tons. The Gately Indoor Track and Field complex also houses After School Matters programming designed by Eckenhoff Saunders. Amenities include a dance and exercise studio, a culinary teaching kitchen, gathering spaces, a rooftop deck and garden, and multipurpose labs for art, music, science, and technology. Participants and the public will also have access to new baseball fields at Gately Park. First announced back in 2014, the project faced early delays due to Illinois's ongoing budgetary crisis but ultimately secured funding through a combination of city, park district, and private sources—including gifts from Exelon Corporation, Mellody Hobson, and George Lucas. The facility broke ground in mid-2018. The new indoor track is an encouraging development within the greater Pullman community. The facility joins the recently completed Pullman ArtSpace Lofts, the neighborhood's first new multifamily development in more than 60 years.   ",Pullman,0
Alderman Vasquez denies zoning change for proposal at 5400 N. Ashland,"Alderman Vasquez has announced that he will not support the zoning change requested for a proposed development at 5400 N. Ashland. Planned by real estate investor Josh Bradley, the project site is located at the northwest corner of N. Ashland Ave and W. Balmoral Ave. Owned for 30 years by the Gillis family, the site had a proposed 7-unit condo project that was rejected back in 2020. In 2021, the existing home on the site was purchased by someone who renovated the interior and resold it. Bradley and his husband bought the home and property in October 2022. Designed by Compass Architecture LLC, the new construction building would have been a five-story structure topping out at 57 feet tall. With 18 residential units in the building, 16 of them will be two-beds and two will be three-bed configurations. 14 of them would’ve been rented at market-rate, with the other four set aside as affordable. A parking garage at the back of the ground floor would include nine car parking spaces and nine bike parking spaces.  The building’s design includes a palette of materials that references the neighborhood and the Picasso sculpture downtown. The facade’s white brick portion relates to the adjacent building on W. Balmoral Ave, while the red brick corners relate to the building to the north of the site on N. Ashland Ave. The corten steel will clad the upper floors, bringing in something new and sharp into the material palette of the neighborhood. The development was planning to include green building features, such as green roofs with native plantings, LED light fixtures with timers and motion sensors, high efficiency HVAC and appliances, EV charging stations, composting, and the infrastructure for the building to be converted all-electric in the future. The developer was asking to rezone the site from RS-3 to B2-3, but Alderman Vasquez denied the change, citing neighbors' concern for its height and density, its design, and for not having enough affordable units in the building. Vasquez said in a statement that he will be having a follow up meeting with the community to discuss the lack of affordable housing in the area and encouraged the developer to meet with neighbors and address their concerns, encouraging a proposal that would be more aesthetically in line with the neighborhood and at least one floor shorter.

Final landmark approved for Greater Union Baptist Church,"The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has approved a final landmark recommendation for Greater Union Baptist Church. Located at 1956 W. Warren, the church stands at the northeast corner of W. Warren Blvd and N. Damen Ave adjacent to the United Center’s vast parking lots. Originally built in 1886 as the Church of the Redeemer, the church was designed by prolific architect William Le Baron Jenney. In 1928, the church was bought by a black baptist congregation and has been used as their place of worship for the last 94 years.  Meeting Criterion 1 for its value as an example of city, state, or national heritage, the Greater Union Baptist Church traces its origin back to the universalist congregation who built the building. During the Civil War, the men and pastor served in the Union Army. After the war was over, the congregation had grown and raised funds to build the present church. They worshiped for 42 years and during that time provided extensive charitable aid to the community and hosted progressive-era lectures. For its association with two energetic pastors, the building also meets Criterion 3 for significant people. Reverend Shelbia Hamilton Graham preached from 1947 to 1967 and used the pulpit to support the spiritual needs of the congregation as well as the social needs of Chicago’s African-American community at-large. Reverend Dr. Walter A McCray served from 1996 - 2002 and returned to the pulpit in 2018, serving to this day. Reverend McCray has increased community outreach and charitable programs at the church and is a nationally recognized, published biblical scholar. The next criteria the church meets is Criterion 4 for its exemplary architecture. Designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney, the brick church reflects Romanesque Revival with its distinct terracotta details and deep-set round arched windows. Jenney’s distinct articulation is visible on the church, with the single large gables on each facade reflecting his preference for fewer elements at a larger scale rather than smaller repeating forms. His trademark varnished southern pine-clad ceilings are also present in the soaring worship space of the church.  Pairing well with Criterion 4, the church also meets Criterion 5 for its status as a work of a significant architect or designer. As discussed earlier, William Le Baron Jenney is the architect of this church, however he’s best known for the invention of the skyscraper, designing the Home Insurance Building as the first skyscraper in the world. His design philosophy and the use of the metal frame for the skyscraper cleared the way for progressive architecture to flourish in the late 19th century.  Retaining a superb level of integrity, the church also meets the separate Integrity Criterion. Over its 136-year history, the church has endured economic disinvestment in its community and the dramatic change to the neighborhood due to the construction of the United Center and its associated parking lots. With credit due to its congregation, the church is a rare survivor of dire economic issues in the area.  With the final landmark recommendation approved by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the proposed designation will protect all exterior elevations and rooflines. The landmark designation must go through the Committee on Zoning and full City Council before the building is officially landmarked.  ",Near West Side,0
Demolition permit issued at 210 N. Morgan,"A demolition permit has been issued for the existing one-story masonry building at 210 N. Morgan. Located midblock between W. Lake St and W. Fulton Market, the site is currently littered with electrical poles which developer Newcastle Limited will bury as part of the pending mixed-use development. With a design from Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the approved project is expected to deliver a 33-story mixed-use tower. The building would have 204 residential units, with 4,000 square feet of retail and the building’s residential lobby on the ground floor. The unit mix will consist of 59 studios, 18 convertibles, 72 one-beds, 23 one-bed plus dens, and 33 two-beds. 50 car parking spaces and 118 bike parking spaces will also be provided.  The massing of the tower began with the base DX-7 zoning and an FAR bonus of 4.5. The tower volume was articulated and stepped down towards W. Fulton Market to reduce its impact on the bustling corridor. The shape of the tower was designed to provide a variety of unit types while offering numerous corner units and apartments with balconies. Outdoor terraces will be available at the 4th, 23rd, and 28th floors. As planned, the development would host 41 affordable units to meet the 20% affordability requirement on-site. At a weighted average of 60% AMI, the ARO units will have a mix of 16 studios, 20 one-beds, and 5 two-beds.  With the demolition permit issued, demolition contractor Heneghan Wrecking & Excavating can begin clearing the site to make way for the new development. The developer originally planned to begin construction in the summer of 2023 with an 18-month construction timeline. With new construction permits yet to be filed, an updated timeline for the building is unclear. ",Fulton Market,1
Boutique offices takes shape along evolving North Branch Corridor,"Drivers on the Kennedy Expressway may have noticed an unusual Jenga-like building under construction at 1525 N. Elston Avenue.  Developed by Alex Pearsall of Property Adventures Corp. and designed by Filoramo Talsma Architecture, the six-story structure might look like modular apartments, but it is in fact the latest office project to spring up in the rapidly evolving North Branch Corridor.  “I’ve heard people ask ‘what is that building?,’” said Ari Topper, a broker for 1525 N. Elston with Baum Realty Group. “It doesn’t look like the typical office product you’d find in the area.”  Boutique in the truest sense of the word, the office floorplans will range from just 3,000 and 4,000 square feet in size. In addition to eye-catching architecture, the building will also offer views of downtown Chicago and parking for 21 vehicles. Two of the building’s five office floors are already leased up, according to Topper. The development is on track to deliver space to tenants in the late second or early third quarter of this year. The progress at 1525 N. Elston—despite the pandemic—is an encouraging signal in the ongoing transformation of the once-industrial North Branch Corridor, which borders neighborhoods such as Bucktown, Lincoln Park, and Noble Square. A sweeping 2017 rezoning of the area has catalyzed investment in the area. Developments include nearby adaptive reuse projects like the loft offices at 1308 N. Elston and the recently approved plan to repurpose the Morton Salt Shed into an entertainment complex, as well as the massive Lincoln Yards high-rise megadevelopment.  Plans for a $40 million driving range slated for 2501 N. Damen Avenue, however, recently fell through.  ",North Branch,0
"Downtown high-rise proposal with more than 1,000 apartments moves forward","A proposal from Vancouver-based Pacific Reach Properties for a pair of glassy apartment towers at 601 W. Monroe Street is forging ahead in the city's approval process after the developer filed a recent zoning application for the West Loop Gate project. Rising 47 and 40 stories (535 and 465 feet, respectively) atop a shared podium, the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed towers would bring 1,053 rental units, 30,000 square feet of retail, and 430 parking spaces to a 1.5-acre site located between the four Presidential Towers, Heritage Green Park, and Old St. Patrick’s Church. The location is currently home to a surface parking lot.  The two-phase proposal was first revealed by Ald. Brendan Reilly in a February 19 newsletter to neighbors. Reilly said the developer had been working on the proposal since 2018 and the team incorporated a number of changes at the alderman's request. Revisions include cutting the towers down from their original heights of 54 and 47 stories, eliminating a hotel component, increasing retail space, and slightly curbing the amount of parking. The project falls under the city's existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) which requires projects that receive a zoning change to provide 10 percent affordable housing (an updated version of the ordinance takes effect in October and bumps the requirements to 20 percent for downtown projects). Pacific Reach will provide seven of its required 105 affordable units on-site and satisfy the remainder of its obligation by paying into the city's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund, according to the application. The developers will also pay the city $5.5 million for a density bonus.  Mark Marshall, senior vice president of development and construction at Pacific Reach, told the Chicago Tribune in February that his company was ""definitely optimistic"" about the apartment market rebounding post-COVID. If approvals go as planned, the developer aims to break ground on the taller 47-story east tower in early 2022 and deliver the building in mid-2024. The 40-story western tower would open in 2025, Marshall told the newspaper.  Though not quite as ""booming"" as Fulton Market to the west, the area between the Chicago River and Kennedy Expressway is seeing an impressive share of real estate activity. Recent office projects like the adaptive reuse of the Old Post Office will be joined by upcoming commercial developments like BMO Tower and 609 W. Randolph Street. Construction is currently underway on a 373-unit apartment development at 354 N. Union Avenue , and the Chicago Plan Commission recently approved a 413-unit rental tower for the parking lot at 640 W. Washington Boulevard.     ",Downtown,1
Developer scraps plan for four-building megaproject in River West,"An ambitious plan to transform a 7-acre riverfront site at 700 W. Chicago Avenue into a mixed-use development with four high-rises will not move forward. Chicago-based Riverside Investment & Development and joint venture partner Nexstar Media Group have reportedly given up pursuing tenants for their massive River West project, according to the Chicago Tribune. Dubbed 700 at the River District, the four-phase development would have replaced a former Tribune distribution building with three loft-style office buildings, a 300-unit residential tower, and 4.5 acres of open space. First unveiled in 2017, the  Goettsch-designed proposal received the green light from the Chicago Plan Commission in early 2018. Its developers had originally planned to break ground on the first office tower later that year but struggled to secure the commercial tenants necessary to kickstart construction.  Riverside boss John O'Donnell told Tribune reporter Ryan Ori that although his team ""came very close"" to closing tenant deals over the past years, it made little sense to continue the search given the pandemic-related vacancies plaguing the office market.  ""We thought looking for office tenants right now was a waste of time,"" O'Donnell told the newspaper. ""Nobody knows what kind of space they need. Everyone's evaluating. There's so much vacancy downtown, it doesn't make sense to start a new building like that."" The 7-acre parcel is part of the larger mixed-use 'River District' megadevelopment that includes an additional 30 acres of land to the immediate south, which is currently home to the Tribune's massive Freedom Center printing plant. The city granted Tribune Media zoning approval for up to 14 mixed-use buildings with 4,099 residential units at the River District site in late 2018. The company then put the property up for sale in early 2019. Tribune Media and its real estate assets were acquired by Nexstar later that year. It's unclear what happens next for 700 W. Chicago Avenue (or the greater River District project, for that matter). Although the site was once floated as a possible location for the long-discussed Chicago casino, its existing 120,000-square-foot building seems more likely to become a last-mile distribution center, according to the Tribune report.  News of Riverside and Nexstar's redevelopment plan fizzling out arrives just days after Vancouver-based developer Onni Group revealed its own multiphase megaproject on nearby Goose Island. The proposal—called Halsted Point—calls for five glassy towers to rise at the site of a Greyhound bus maintenance facility located just across the Chicago River from the 700 W. Chicago Avenue site. In fact, 700 at the River District appears in the background of several Halsted Point renderings. Whereas 700 at the River District relied heavily on office tenants to get the project off the ground, Halsted Point will focus on building four residential towers containing a combined 2,650 apartments before starting work on its fifth-phase office building.  ""We believe residential is going be much quicker to come back post-pandemic than commercial,"" said Onni's Brian Brodeur at Friday's virtual community meeting. ""That's the reason we've phased our site the way we have, with our commercial building last.""   ",River West,0
Tribune East Tower may still happen,"Almost three years after the tower was originally approved, Tribune East Tower may actually still happen. Approved back in May 2020, the project proposed by CIM Group and Golub & Co was rumored to have been scrapped until now. Located at 421 N. Michigan, developer CIM Group has updated its website with a new bidding opportunity for general contractors. Designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the supertall skyscraper will stand 1,442 feet, just 8 feet shy of Willis Tower’s 1,450 feet. Rising 102 floors, the structure will taper as it rises, clad in a glass curtain wall with gold-colored vertical fins that preserves views of the original Tribune Tower from the Ogden Slip.  The 1.3 million square-foot building has undergone a few revisions in its scope, increasing the hotel from 200 to 250 keys and reducing the parking count from 687 cars down to 426 spaces. The 564 residential units will remain with the same split of 125 condominiums and 439 rentals. As part of the project, the development will include upgrades on site for both Upper and Lower E. Illinois St for residents and hotel guests entering the building. The existing Pioneer Court Plaza along N Michigan Avenue has already been renovated as part of the first phase to create additional green space and outdoor seating. While construction was originally slated to begin back in early 2022, the new information from CIM Group calls for the commencement of construction in February 2024. With a general contractor yet to be chosen, work is planned to wrap up in September 2027.  ",Streeterville,0
Chicago Fire breaks ground on training facility,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently joined Chicago FC Owner and Chairman Joe Mansueto, Alderman Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) CEO Tracey Scott, and Mary Baggett, President of the Local Advisory Committee for ABLA/Brooks Homes to celebrate the groundbreaking of the Fire’s new performance and training facility at 1336 S. Loomis in the Roosevelt Square neighborhood on the Near West Side.   ""The Chicago Fire is a top tier football club and the team and its players deserve a top tier training facility,"" said Mayor Lightfoot. ""I am also pleased that the Near West Side community will benefit from the job opportunities, recreational space, and housing support that CFFC has committed to providing as part of this development.""   As a complex for the team to prepare for matches and improve the team, it will include two and a half hybrid grass fields for the team and three synthetic turf fields for the Chicago Fire Academy. An inflatable dome will be placed on top of the northwest field during the colder months from November to March. With Crawford Architects on board for the design, the training facility will measure 53,000 square feet and stand two floors high, down from an original 95,000 square-foot, three-story plan. On the ground floor, program space will include locker rooms, medical space, workout space, hydrotherapy, and a video room. The second floor will host offices, a cafeteria, and meeting space for team operations. A 4,100 square foot building for the field crew will be located just off S. Loomis St and W. Hastings St. The campus will include a pedestrian greenway corridor through the site. Starting at the intersection of S. Loomis St and W. 14th Pl, the pathway will run through the site over to S. Ashland Ave and W. 14th St. Projected to cost $75-80 million, the project will be entirely privately funded by the team, with no city financing. The city recently announced the signing of a ground lease between the Chicago Fire FC and the Chicago Housing Authority that will generate $40 million in revenue for CHA over the next 40 years which will be applied towards the agency’s housing initiatives. With ground broken and the first permit issued, construction can begin on the site. Pepper Construction will be leading the construction of the facility which is targeted for a Summer 2024 opening.

43 Green Phase 2 scores permits,"The second phase of 43 Green, a mixed-use eTOD adjacent to the 43rd CTA Green Line stop, has received both its caisson and full building permit. Located at 4307 S. Prairie, the project will rise to the west of the 43rd Green Line CTA stop.  The Habitat Company and P3 Markets are co-developing the new mixed-use project, which is set to deliver a 10-story building holding 80 residential units and 4,000 square feet of ground floor retail space. Future tenants include a UPS office and dental practice. 13 car parking spaces and 56 bike parking spaces will be provided. With Landon Bone Baker Architects and Moody Nolan collaborating on the design, the building’s massing will define the urban edge at the corner of the property, while using setbacks to reduce the massing of the building adjacent to the neighborhood to the south and CTA L tracks to the east. The massing aims to reference the volume of the first phase, creating two bookends flanking the CTA tracks.  Rising 106 feet, the roofline will match phase one, with the building massing broken up into different sections that exhibit a modulation in facade treatment, creating interest and differentiation along both street frontages. Balconies are used as a massing strategy to erode corners and provide residents with views of the surrounding city. With 80 units in the building, 37 units will be priced at 60% AMI, 7 at 50% AMI, and 36 at market-rate. The unit breakdown will include 24 studios averaging 470 square feet, 48 one-beds averaging 660 square feet, and 8 two-bed apartments that will average 925 square feet. The $45 million project will be funded through a variety of sources, including $10 million in TIF funding, $6.3 million from a HUD mortgage, $20.9 million in LIHTC equity, $6.5 million in multifamily housing funds, and $610,000 in deferred developer fees. The two city-owned lots, appraised at $162,000, will be sold to the developer at $1 per parcel.  With the issuance of both permits, general contractors Bowa Construction and McHugh Construction can begin building the development. Construction was originally planned to begin in January 2023, so the planned completion date of Q2 2024 is likely to be pushed back. ",Bronzeville,1
Plan Commission approves 800 W. Lake,"The Chicago Plan Commission has approved a mixed-use development proposed at 800 W. Lake. Located at the corner of W. Lake St and N. Halsted St, the new proposal comes from Ascend Real Estate Group and Intercontinental Real Estate Group after a previous plan for a hotel tower sputtered out during COVID. With GREC Architects leading the design, the 36-story mixed-use building will anchor the prominent corner standing 412 feet tall, with 406 apartments, ground floor retail space, 102 car parking spaces, and 406 bike parking spaces. The project’s unit mix includes 116 studios, 174 one-beds, and 116 two-beds. To meet affordability requirements, 81 of the residential units will be set aside as affordable with the developer working with the city to provide an additional 10% of affordable units. With an emphasis on verticality, the facade expression will be consistent throughout the height of the building, elongating the visual impression of the building while camouflaging the podium. As the building rises, geometric inflections at the corner add texture to the building and offer spaces for residential balconies.  At the street, the tower sets back from N. Halsted St to create relief at the corner and a small public open space. As a result of feedback from the Committee on Design, the retail space has been shifted to face the outdoor space and wrap around to W. Lake St, with the residential lobby set to occupy the building frontage along the western half of W. Lake St and wrap around to the western side of the building. A double height porte cochere will provide a drop-off zone for residents while also providing access to parking and loading. Bike parking has been added to the north side of the N. Halsted St frontage, providing direct access for cyclists to the bike parking spaces. The tower facade will be clad entirely in glass, with vertical fins gracing the facade in a way that reinforces the parti of two interlocking volumes creating the tower. When viewed at an angle, the fins start to be perceived as solid geometry and contrast from the structurally glazed window wall. Spandrel glazing will help the building meet energy code while reinforcing the glass expression of the facade. The ground floor facade has been redesigned, adding brick masonry around the columns at the base. The developers are seeking to rezone the site to DX-10 before reinstituting the Planned Development designation. Set to cost $230 million, the development will also pay $2.2 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to receive additional FAR. With Plan Commission approval secured, the proposal will now look to get approvals from the Committee on Zoning and City Council. The project is targeted for a June 2024 groundbreaking, with a 24-month construction timeline leading to a potential opening in Summer 2026. ",Fulton Market,1
Urbanize tours penthouses at The Row Fulton Market,"Urbanize returned to The Row Fulton Market to see the upper residences and penthouses at the top of the building. Overlooking Fulton Market and the surrounding city, the building at 164 N. Peoria was developed by Related Midwest with the design coming from Morris Adjmi Architects.  Starting on the 33rd floor, the Tier 3 model unit was a 3-bedroom, 2.5-bath layout measuring 1,650 square feet. Priced at a range of $6,495-$7,465 per month, the particular layout we viewed featured a southeastern view from the large living space and kitchen. One of the bedrooms was staged to show how residents could use it as a private home office in an era of working from home. Heading up to the 42nd floor, the first penthouse we toured measured almost 2,400 square feet with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths. The large living space and kitchen faces northeast, giving sweeping views of downtown and the lakefront going north, while the east-facing primary suite also features expansive views of downtown. 12-foot ceilings, motorized window shades, and heated floors in the primary suite bathroom are just a few of the luxury features in the penthouse that is listed for $15,250 per month. Our final stop was a 43rd floor penthouse featuring a northwest exposure in the main living space with bedrooms facing west. With 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, the almost 2,400 square foot layout would rent for $16,250 per month. While sharing many of the luxury features of the other penthouse, this configuration includes a 430-square-foot outdoor terrace that wraps around the northwest corner to give views west and north from the building. In our previous tour at the end of June, we saw the building’s amenity spaces which are on the sixth floor. Residents will have access to the Gather Room and connecting Study, which offer a range of seating configurations and workspace options ranging from booths to library tables to private conference rooms oriented around a three-sided fireplace; the Athletic Club, a fully equipped fitness center with adjacent Wellness Studio and two separate terraces for open-air workouts; the Playhouse, a colorful, interactive play area for children outfitted with toys, games and spaces for playdates and parties; and the Social Club, a reservable entertainment suite with adjacent terrace.  Outside, the 13,800-square-foot landscaped deck wraps the tower on three sides, featuring the west-facing lap pool with lounge seating; the three outdoor grilling kitchens tucked under pergolas and separated by high planters; the lounging hammocks; and the two fire pits overlooking the surrounding cityscape. With the first move-ins starting back in early June, the building is already 85% leased, with all of the affordable units rented. Four of the six penthouses have already been leased, with two layouts remaining. ",Fulton Market,0
Architects envision new intermodal riverwalk for Chicago River's south branch,"Chicago-area design firm DMAC Architecture has revealed an ambitious vision for bringing new open space and a riverwalk to the south branch of the Chicago River. Located just east of the office building at 300 S. Riverside Plaza, the concept was created in response to Amtrak's concept to reactivate an unused platform near Union Station and add egress stairs to street level. DMAC, working with property owner Third Millennium Group, saw the situation as a chance to create something special. ""We felt there is a solution for egress that can be satisfied in a much better way,"" DMAC founder and principal Dwayne MacEwen told Urbanize. ""You can't make this the 'back door' to Union Station. It should be the front door to the city and river. Chicago exists where it does because of the river. To not embrace it seemed like a missed opportunity."" The concept treats the need for new stairs as a starting point to extend a perimeter walkway around 300 S. Riverside and potentially down to the waterfront with a series of ramps. The upper terrace is envisioned as an outdoor dining area, while the lower levels serve as public gathering spaces and piers that could be used by kayakers, tour boats, and floating ""tree taxi"" islands. The walkways would allow train passengers to emerge from Union Station at river level, while an acoustic ""veil"" and baffle in front of the platforms would help absorb sound. A proposed pedestrian connection would pass beneath the Van Buren Street Bridge and provide access to the redeveloped Old Post Office property.  The landscaping takes inspiration from the location's existing features, which include wild vegetation growing on remnants of the sea caves—a series of sunken waterfront tunnels leftover when engineers reversed the flow of the Chicago River in 1900. The concept also takes advantage of intermodal connectivity at the site, which is served by trains, buses, boats, bicycles, and even helipads on the roof of 300 S. Riverside. Described by Third Millennium Group managing director Adam Mizrachi as a ""love letter to Chicago,"" the so-called Riverwalk@300SRP plan is still very much in the concept phase. Its designers hope renderings of the project can start a conversation about how to make it a reality.  ""This is a 'love letter,' so we're not at the altar yet,"" said MacEwen. ""Developers often look at a project from the standpoint of how it impacts the bottom line, but this is something that the city should want to do.""  ""It's ambitious, we know,"" added the architect. ""But there's also a sense that if phase one is adding the egress stairs from the train platform, let's do it in a way that still allows [the riverwalk] to happen later.""  Amtrak spokesperson Marc Magliari confirmed that have been discussions about activating the unused tracks under the Old Post Office as passenger platforms serving Union Station, but challenges remain and no decision has been made.  ""These tracks were designed to connect to the Old Post Office and not Union Station, so riders would have to cross active tracks to get to them,"" Magliari told Urbanize. ""We have to find a way to solve the issues of getting people from the station to the platform in a safe and accessible way."" Magliari also noted that nearby developments such as Bank of America Tower, Southbank, and The 78 already provide riverwalks on the opposite bank of the river. ""There's the question of where the city intends to build a continuous riverwalk for the south branch,"" Magliari said. This post has been updated with additional information from Amtrak.

Damen Ave with the residential entry notched into at the intersection between the two building volumes.  The $41.2 million will be funded in part by a $10 million TIF payment from the city. General contractor McShane Construction Company already has the caisson permits in hand to begin work. A timeline for completion is currently unknown. ",Near West Side,1
Guinness Open Gate Brewery celebrates ribbon cutting,"Guinness recently celebrated the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Guinness Open Gate Brewery in Fulton Market. Located at 901 W. Kinzie, the former rail depot consists of a brewery, taproom, restaurant, and bakery housed in a 15,000-square-foot newly transformed space. This site will combine more than 260 years of brewing experience from Ireland, with cutting edge American brewing innovation, for a uniquely Chicago experience.  “This is an exciting step in the continuing evolution of the Guinness brand in America. It’s been a long journey, but we are so thrilled to be opening our doors this week and to contribute to Chicago’s world class food and beer scene,” said Rodney Williams, President of Diageo Beer Company. “As a Chicago native, I can confidently share that we aim to celebrate and showcase this great city and make a positive impact in the community, all while serving great beer.” Designed by Whitney Architects and Studio K Creative, the design of the building marries new and old, transforming a long vacant building into a state of-the-art facility, with a front patio with stairs reminiscent of Chicago’s Riverwalk steps, and a contemporary door with weathered steel finish. The space features a hand painted mural, complemented by a bubbly amber sculptural light fixture – a nod to the iconic foam atop a fresh pint of Guinness – which flows throughout the brewery. A nearly 10,000-pound harp sculpture with layered ambient lighting sits high above the main taproom bar.  Guests can expect 12-16 rotating experimental draughts, most of which will be brewed on site and exclusively available in the taproom, alongside signatures like Guinness Draught Stout, Guinness Extra Stout, and Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, which will always come straight from Dublin. Led by Brewer Megan Schwarz, the Chicago brewing team’s 10-barrel brewhouse is hard at work with an initial line-up including Corn Maize Cream Ale made from corn grown in Illinois’ Iroquois County, Kinzie Street Pale Ale, and a Mango Chile Ale. Guinness 0 Nonalcoholic Draught will also be available.  The culinary program will be led by Dream Team Hospitality, a joint venture by local industry veterans, with chef Taylor Bischof at the helm. The food menu draws inspiration from the brand’s Irish roots and global footprint, alongside reimagined Chicago classics. The site will offer morning bakery and café service daily, with an all-day restaurant menu available Wednesday through Sunday, as well as brunch on weekends.  Clune Construction served as the general contractor for the build-out.

City Council approves 2405 W. Grand,"The Chicago City Council has approved a rezoning for 2405 W. Grand. Bounded by W. Grand Ave to the north and N. Western Ave to the east, the property is currently a vacant site except for a billboard sign. Planned by RDM Companies, the billboard will be demolished as part of the development.  With a design from Kennedy Mann, the project will deliver a five-story, mixed-use building. Rising 70 feet, the development will include 4,745 square feet of retail space on the ground floor, with 40 dwelling units located on the floors above. The project’s unit mix will consist of 8 studios, 4 one-beds, 16 two-beds, and 12 three-beds.  Parking for the project will include 11 surface car parking spaces as well as approximately 35 indoor bike parking spaces. The developers will improve the pedestrian experience by adding new decorative planters and trees along the sidewalk as well as cornice and marquee style overhangs to provide pedestrians with protection from the weather. With City Council approval of the rezoning from M1-2 to C1-3, the development is one step closer to construction. The developers will need to seek a variation from the Zoning Board of Appeal to allow for the reduction of the rear setback from 30 feet to zero for floors containing residential units.

Foundation permit issued for 1217 W. Washington,"A foundation permit has been issued for a mixed-use development at 1217 W. Washington. Located between two adjacent historic buildings, the site is currently a vacant lot that overlooks the intersection of W. Washington Blvd and N. Willard Ct. DAC Developments is collaborating with Melrose Ascension Capital on the project.    Designed by Pappageorge Haymes, the project consists of a 19-story mixed-use tower. Expected to rise 213 feet, the tower will hold 4,000 square feet of retail space and 287 residential units. The apartment mix is expected to be approximately 45% studios, 35% one-bedrooms, and 20% two-bedroom rentals. The building will host 183 parking spaces for residential tenants. The building meets the ground with a four-story podium that will hold the ground floor retail space, residential lobby, and parking on the upper three floors. The street-facing facade will be made up of brick and punched window openings. The ground floor will open up with storefront glazing and a recessed entry protected by a glass canopy. Setback 25 feet from the street, the tower portion will be articulated with a metal frame pattern that contrasts with and projects from the glass facade. The top two floors will hold amenity space including indoor programming and an outdoor deck with pool. With a foundation permit hand, general contractor Focus Construction can get started on the $100 million development. With an approximate 18-month timeline, the development is set to wrap up in Spring 2024.  ",West Loop,0
Committee on Design reviews 12 W. Maple,"The Committee on Design has reviewed a proposal for a residential tower at 12 W. Maple. Planned by Fern Hill Company and Calmwater Capital, the project will be located just west of Mariano Park and the intersection of W. Maple St and N. State St. The tight site is currently occupied by a four-story masonry building and small one-story structure. With Lamar Johnson Collaborative as the architect, the new development will consist of a 34-story residential tower. Planned to rise 449 feet, the building will deliver 54 luxury condominium residences. Tenants will have access to 81 parking spaces accessed by two vertical car lifts managed by a dedicated valet. Amenities will be located at the 7th and 18th floors of the tower. Drawing from the context of the Gold Coast and the shores of Lake Michigan, the tower’s massing has been carved in strategic locations based on unit layouts and orientation of views to the east. The exterior terraces are anchored by landscape, providing native grasses on every terrace and trees at the 7th floor outdoor terrace. At the ground floor, special attention was paid to the pedestrian experience with high quality natural limestone and metal paneling brought down to the ground along the W. Maple St facade. The residential entry will be along the western end of the street frontage, with a curb cut placed to allow for cars to enter an internal motor court, bringing pick-up, drop-off, deliveries, and valet queuing off of the street. The discussion opened with John Ronan questioning the blank western wall created by placing the core along the western property line of the building. Ronan suggested that this blank wall seems unnecessary, and the corridor and elevators could be flipped to allow for a light-filled corridor facing west. Later in the discussion, Sara Beardsley suggested bringing some kind of activation or massing articulation to the west elevation so that the building wouldn’t seemingly turn its back on its neighbors to the west Brian Lee reiterated the idea of the building’s relation to its neighbors later saying the current design is thumbing its nose to the neighbors to the west and reconfiguring the core would be very helpful. John Ronan chimed in and asked if the core could be oriented east to west which could help achieve units with three-direction exposures. The design team responded that they can’t use any exposure facing west for light and ventilation requirements due to being up against the property line but reconfiguring the core could work well to improve the western elevation.  The next point came from Reed Kroloff who asked why there are so many car parking spaces in the project and whether the curb cut is really needed along W. Maple St. The design team responded that the parking ratio is in response to market demands and that the height of the parking podium allows for the amenity deck to sit just above the adjacent building to the east. In regard to the curb cut, the alley at the back of the site is narrow and is littered with dumpsters and interrupted by electrical poles, so two-way traffic through the alley would be very difficult. While introducing a curb cut was not the first choice, it would allow for vehicles to come off the street and reduce traffic.  Committee member Hana Ishikawa expressed concern for the landscaping planned for the building, discussing how it will be hard to have plantings underneath overhangs be viable in the long-term. Ishikawa also questioned how plantings within private homes could be maintained in the original design intent.  The design team from LJC responded that they have consulted with their in-house landscape architects and are considering the balance between protecting the grasses from the wind and ensuring their viability under the overhangs. With regard to upkeep, the developers plan to implement a program through the eventual HOA that will manage maintenance for the greenery and plantings within the building. The final comment came from Reed Kroloff who identified that the current design calls for natural limestone at the base and cost-effective precast concrete for the upper portion of the tower used to mimic limestone. Kroloff pointed out that those two materials will age and color differently resulting in a two-tone facade over time. Kroloff encouraged the design and development team to bring integrity to the facade by either bringing the limestone all the way up or taking the precast concrete panels down to the base. After this meeting, the project will continue going through the city review process, with these comments integrated into those future discussions. As the project looks to rezone the site, it will need approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council. The developers are looking to secure approvals before looking at a timeline for leasing and construction.  ",Gold Coast,0
Rental penthouses now leasing at The Belden-Stratford,"Leasing is now underway for a selection of just-released rental penthouses at The Belden-Stratford, the iconic Beaux-Arts apartment property in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighborhood that reopened this year following a full-scale restoration and renovation. The six penthouse residences showcase unobstructed views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline from the property’s upper floors, paired with thoughtfully designed floor plans and upscale finishes that complement historic structural details. “Our penthouse residences truly embody what makes The Belden-Stratford so special, from graceful spaces carefully appointed to appeal to today’s modern renters, to glimpses of this century-old building’s history and architecture, to an unmatched address in Lincoln Park that affords residents not only an amazing lifestyle, but also some of the very best views in the entire city,” said Ari Glass, head of real estate for Mansueto Office. Overlooking the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory, the 16-story property was constructed in 1923 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by architect Meyer Fridstein, it originally opened as a residential hotel before eventually transitioning entirely to rental apartments. The Belden-Stratford was purchased in 2018 by Mansueto Office – the investment firm of Joe Mansueto, who was a resident of the property during the 1980s – and renovation work began in late 2020. Today, it comprises 209 luxury apartments, including studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom residences as well as a selection of penthouses with double-height living space, with monthly rents ranging from $2,500 to $15,000. Penthouse rents start at $7,250. The penthouses are located on the 15th floor, along the building’s entire east and south sides, and are topped by the building’s roof deck. The five remaining penthouse floor plans include two one-bedroom designs with one and 1 1⁄2 baths, respectively; a two-bedroom, two-bath layout; and two residences with two bedrooms, two baths and a den. All penthouse residences feature extra-high ceilings – including spaces with 17-foot ceilings with decorative beams – and double-height windows topped by paned arches, which, in addition to framing sweeping views of Lake Michigan and Lincoln Park, are also a notable architectural detail accenting the building’s mansard roofline. Penthouse interiors feature upscale island kitchens with GE Profile stainless steel appliances and quartz countertops; upsized window trim; custom closets with built-in shelving; and full-size in-unit washer and dryer. Complementing the penthouse lifestyle at The Belden-Stratford is the ambiance of the building’s many original features and finishes that were restored during the renovation process. In the ornate double-height lobby, gilded plaster molding and gold-leaf detailing were fully refurbished, as were marble paneling and entryways adorned with mirrored windows and walnut trim, which had been covered during previous renovations. In addition, hand-painted canvases that hung on the walls when the building first opened were recreated. The renovation also introduced a full suite of lifestyle amenities as the building was reimagined for modern renters. Housed in the historic property’s original common spaces, they include an elegant mezzanine-level lounge with an original arched picture window overlooking the Lincoln Park Conservatory; a double-height fitness center in what was once the building’s ballroom; a billiards and media lounge; wine tasting room; temperature-controlled wine storage room; and reservable conference rooms and meeting areas. Residents also have access to a rooftop sun deck featuring a wet bar, outdoor TV, two gas fireplaces, grilling stations and multiple seating areas, all overlooking the skyline, Lincoln Park and Lake Michigan. Additional resident offerings include Luxer One package service and on-site Tesla rentals. The Belden-Stratford is also home to Mon Ami Gabi, a popular French bistro with a direct connection to the building’s lobby, giving residents an elegant on-site dining option in addition to the variety of restaurants found in the surrounding neighborhood. For leasing information or to schedule a tour, visit www.BeldenStratford.com or call (844) 326-5908. An on-site leasing office is open daily by appointment only.   ",Lincoln Park,0

Full building permit issued for 1505 N. Sedgwick,"A full building permit has been issued for a mixed-use development at 1505 N. Sedgwick. Located on a midblock site, the narrow property is located within a two-minute walk of the Sedgwick Brown Line stop. Developed by 1507 N Sedgwick LLC, a demolition permit issued in May paved the way to clear the way for the new construction.  Designed by Hanna Architects, the new building will stand four floors high, with 4 residential units and 800 square feet of office space that will front the street. The four residential units will include one three-bed duplex down at the back of the ground floor, while the remaining three residential units will occupy one floor each, all of them 3-bedroom configurations. 12 bike parking spaces will be located along the alley. The project received a series of approvals from the Zoning Board of Appeals in February, including a special use to allow for residential use below the second floor, a variation to reduce the rear setback from 30 feet down to 6 feet, and a variation to reduce the required parking spaces from four to zero as the site is a transit-served location.

Four-story apartment project headed to vacant lot on 43rd Street,"It's always encouraging to see vacant land bite the dust for new infill development. And in Bronzeville's Oakland community, an overgrown lot at 920 E. 43rd Street (also known as Muddy Waters Drive around those parts) is about to be replaced by a new four-story mixed-use building. Developed by D.O.M. Properties Investment, the plan consists of 3,800 square feet of street-level commercial space topped by 33 one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments. The project, which was designed by Pro-Plan Architects, also includes parking spread across a ground-floor garage and a surface lot. This project is what is commonly called an ""as of right"" development, meaning it doesn't require any kind of zoning change or financial support from the city. These types of developments often materialize out of public view, but the developer behind  920 E. 43rd Street conducted a courtesy presentation for residents at a virtual meeting on Thursday hosted by Ald. Sophia King.  The four-story structure is close to breaking ground, according to developer Marcin Orpik of D.O.M. Properties Investment. ""Everything is approved,"" said Orpik. ""We are just waiting on [the final] paperwork.""

Photos: A look inside Chinatown's new SpringHill Suites hotel,"Work is complete on Chinatown's new 148-room SpringHill Suites hotel, which was built as a four-story vertical expansion of an existing parking garage and retail strip. Located at 2353 S. Wentworth Avenue and steps from the Cermack-Chinatown CTA Red Line station, the 80,000-square-foot development operates under parent company Marriott International and is currently accepting reservations on its website. The SpringHill Suites project comes from developer ME Wentworth, LLC. The venture is led by investor Che Mei Wong, who paid $10.6 million for the property in 2017, according to Crain's Chicago Business. The new hotel was completed with minimal interruption to the existing structure's retail and office tenants by using deep micropile foundations to support the weight of the addition, said Summit Design + Build, which served as construction manager on the project. Chicago-based Vari Architects designed the new structure with some zen-inspired touches as a nod to the surrounding neighborhood. Amenities include a first-floor lobby and reception area, a gym, breakfast room, and meeting room. The newly-completed SpringHill Suites hotel isn't the only notable project along Wentworth Avenue.

Revised details for 3950 N. Damen presented to community,"Developers of 3950 N. Damen and 3959 N. Lincoln recently presented their revised plans to the community.  Located at the intersection of N. Damen Ave, N Lincoln Ave, and W. Irving Park Rd, the plan includes the surface parking lot and bank building at 3950 N. Damen as well as the five-story Fifth Third bank building at 3959 N. Lincoln. Orchard Development Group and Ravine Park Partners are partnering on the project. With a history dating back to December 2020, the Damen site was originally proposed as a new grocery store with a new multifamily building on the Lincoln site. After being rejected, the developers came back to the community with an eight-story building on the Damen site and the rehab of the bank building with an addition. After the community rejected the height, they cut the Damen site down to 7 floors and presented that plan to the Committee on Design. With a configuration that was 7 floors by the intersection and five further south, the Committee on Design suggested they return to a denser building along W. Irving Park Rd. Designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative, the project team presented two schemes. The first kept the 7-story volume along W. Irving Park Rd with five floors further south, setting back the top floor to reduce its impact on the street. The second version looked at making the northern portion 8 floors and lowering the southern portion to just four floors.  Rising 82 feet, the 7-and-5-story scheme would deliver 176 residential units, split into 70 junior one-beds and studios, 33 one-beds, and 73 two-beds and three-beds. Fifth Third Bank will occupy 3,500 square feet of the retail space and have an internal drive through accessed via a curb cut on N. Damen Ave. The ground floor will be rounded out with another 1,700 square feet of retail, a fitness center, bike storage, and 73 parking spaces.   Rising 92 feet, the 8-and-4-story scheme would deliver 166 residential units, split into 65 junior one-beds and studios, 33 one-beds, and 68 two-beds and three-beds. Fifth Third Bank will occupy 3,500 square feet of the retail space and have an internal drive through accessed via a curb cut on N. Damen Ave. Similar to the 7-story plan, the ground floor will be rounded out with another 1,700 square feet of retail, a fitness center, bike storage, and 73 parking spaces.  Both of these plans would rehab the bank building with two five-story additions on the wings of that building. Rising 65 feet, the new additions onto 3959 N. Lincoln will result in a total of 92 units, split into 46 one beds and 46 two-beds and three-beds. The ground floor will have 5,000 square feet of retail with 22 parking spots. The development will incorporate 20% units at 60% AMI, while also working with the alderman’s office to pursue city subsidies to increase that percentage. Since Fifth Third Bank owns the site, the developers are required to include the bank in the new building with the drive through, vacating the retail space of the historic bank building and opening it up to new tenants.  The developers expect the approval process to last another six months before spending 18-24 months building the new midrise at 3950 N. Damen. One that is done, Fifth Third Bank will move from their space in 3959 N. Lincoln into the new retail space, allowing the developers to begin work on the historic bank building as a second phase to the project. This second phase will last another year, leading to the overall project taking three to four years. ",North Center,1
Zoning application filed for 420 N. May,"A zoning application has been filed for Crescent Heights’ proposal for a 615-foot-tall tower at 420 N. May. Located at the western end of the West Loop, the project site is placed between the two sets of Metra tracks, bound by N. May St, W. Kinzie St, and N. Racine Ave.   Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, the tower is planned as a focal point for the highly visible site, creating a gateway to the West Loop with an iconic design. The dynamic massing reflects the convergence of surrounding neighborhoods and extends the life and activity of the street vertically up the facade. An existing masonry building will be preserved and incorporated into the design, while a pedestrian corridor will be made where Ann St. used to run through the property. Rising 53 floors, the tower’s design began as an extrusion. That volume was stepped to the west and distinguished with a reveal and facets in the vertical massing. The design was completed by adding a crown and making the facade contextual. The bulk of the building sits to the west side of the site, with a lower six-story podium occupying most of the property towards the east.  At the ground floor, the first residential lobby will sit at the base of the tower, facing a pedestrian plaza at the northeast corner of W. Kinzie St and N. Racine Ave. Along W. Kinzie St, the building will hold 3,100 square feet of retail, a second residential entry, 2,700 square feet of coworking amenity, and a bike amenity space. Totaling 587 units, the building’s apartments will be a mix of micro, studio, one-beds, one-bed plus dens, two-beds, and three-beds. To meet affordable requirements, 118 units will be designated as affordable at an average of 60% AMI. Within the podium, 440 parking spaces (up from 339) will be wrapped with residential units facing the street frontages. 587 bike parking spaces will also be provided.  With the official zoning application submitted, the developers are moving forward with plans to rezone the site from M2-3 to DX-5 with a Planned Development designation that includes the use of a 3.1 FAR bonus. As the proposal progresses, it will need to go before the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council for full approval.  ",West Loop,1
City considers purchase of shuttered Aldi in West Garfield Park,"As part of its steps to help get a grocery store back to the West Garfield Park neighborhood, the City of Chicago has taken steps to potentially purchase a recently closed Aldi. Approved by the Community Development Commission, the city now has the authority to enter into a negotiated site acquisition agreement. First reported by Austin Weekly News, the store shuttered abruptly at the beginning of October. After serving the neighborhood for over 30 years, the closure has left the neighborhood severely void of grocery stores. After discussions with Aldi, city officials reported in the commission meeting that Aldi will not reopen the location. The acquisition authority comes as part of the city’s strategy to get a grocer back into the retail space. While the city is not buying the plot at this time, the authority allows the city to quickly pivot to do so if that becomes their designated strategy. Currently, the city and DPD is actively referring grocers to the site’s broker to get a new grocery tenant as quickly as possible. If the city decides to pursue the purchase of the parcel, the city would pay $700,000 for the property and would allow them to control the re-tenanting process. Aldi is reportedly aware of the city’s move to potentially purchase the site and would engage in the sale. The acquisition goal would be to further help facilitate re-tenanting. DPD is looking to work with the local community to ensure the new use of the property meets the community’s needs. The acquisition authority will now head to City Council for a final approval. A City Council approval will give DPD and the city the ability to enter negotiations with Aldi and be a more integral part of negotiations for the future of the site. ",West Garfield Park,0
Permits are in the works for 566 W. Van Buren,"New construction permits have been filed for the planned new mixed-use development at 566 W. Van Buren. Planned by Riverside Investment & Development and Bluestar Properties, the project was previously occupied by a three-story masonry building and a two-story masonry building which were both recently demolished. The rest of the site is currently a surfacing parking lot. With a design from Antunovich Associates, the new 14-story tower will rise 155 feet within the site’s existing DX-7 zoning. The new development will deliver 198 residential units with 2,500 square feet of retail on the ground floor facing the intersection of W. Van Buren St and S. Jefferson St. The residential lobby will front W. Van Buren St, with balconies rising above on the south facade. Planned with a mix of studios, junior one-beds, one-beds, one-bed plus dens, and two-beds, residents will have access to a suite of rooftop amenities including a fitness center, co-working space, and a club room. On an exterior rooftop deck, residents will have access to a rooftop pool and grilling stations. On the ground floor, a dog run and dog spa are located behind the parking ramp along the alley. Parking for residents will total 76 car parking spaces and 99 bicycle spaces. Parking access for 24 cars on the ground floor will be via the public alley, with a parking ramp off of S. Jefferson St for the remaining 52 spaces on the second floor. The building has been designed to fit into the context of the West Loop neighborhood incorporating a brick and glass façade. The parking floors are clad with translucent glass and the ground floor will be set back approximately 2 feet from the property line to provide a wider sidewalk with new street planters and trees along both Jefferson and Van Buren Streets. The existing curb cut on Van Buren Street has been removed and the Jefferson Street curb cut has been reduced by 5’ for the parking entrance. The project is being developed as an as-of-right development which means that the building fits under the existing zoning rights. Since no formal city approvals are required, the developers can move forward with construction once permits are issued. While a timeline for completion is currently unknown, Lendlease has been tapped to serve as the general contractor. ",West Loop Gate,0
43 Green Phase 2 celebrates topping off,"The Habitat Company and P3 Markets have announced the topping off of 43 Green Phase 2 just west of the 43rd Street Green Line station at 4309 S. Prairie. Phase 2 is targeted for completion by late summer 2024 with resident move-ins scheduled to begin soon after. “Seeing the continued progress of 43 Green, with its first residential building at capacity and the Phase 2 property reaching top-off height, we are that much closer to fulfilling our vision of bringing much-needed housing and retail options to the Bronzeville community,” said Habitat President Matt Fiascone. Designed by Moody Nolan and LBBA Architects, the Phase 2 property has 80 units, 44 of which will be affordable with the remaining 36 set to be rented at market rate. When complete, the project will have surface parking for 13 vehicles, 56 bicycle parking spots, two outdoor terraces, a fitness center, laundry facilities, and flex work-from-home spaces, as well as 3,700 square feet of retail. Bowa Construction and McHugh Construction have entered into a joint venture to lead the construction of the first two phases of the development. A third residential phase, with approximately 70 units, is expected to break ground in early 2025.   ",Bronzeville,1
Landmarks approves Pioneer Bank redevelopment,"The Permit Review Committee has approved planned modifications to the Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank Building at 4000 W. North Ave. Located at the corner of W. North Ave and N. Pulaski Ave, the bank building is part of a larger redevelopment by Park Row Development that will see the construction of a new 9-story building on the adjacent vacant lots to the north. Built in 1924, the Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank Building will be converted into a cultural hub and community center with office space on the upper floors as part of the development. Designed by JGMA, the banking hall will be used as an indoor market and event space, with upper floors being reused as offices for JGMA itself. The restoration of the building will see the front doors to the banking hall repaired with the cast iron surround restored as well. The non-historic canopy will be removed, and a new code-compliant door will be installed in place of the door at the north end of the building frontage. Windows around the exterior will be repaired or replaced as needed, with windows on the north elevation to be removed and infilled with brick in anticipation of the new building to the north. The west elevation will see the carving out of the facade for a set of new windows on the upper floors. On the interior, the bridge over the south apse will get a code-compliant glass guardrail inbound of the existing historic metal railing, overlooking the banking hall. The secondary entrance will be reconfigured with a new stair and elevator along the north wall of the banking hall. After studying multiple locations, the elevator was placed where it can access all floors with minimal disruption. A new bridge will be added in the northern apse with a glass guardrail to connect the mezzanine levels.  While the new building is not under the purview of the Permit Review Committee, the planned building will stand nine floors, encompassing a branch location of the Chicago Public Library, 79 affordable housing units, and a public plaza. The unit mix will consist of 40% one-beds, 30% two-beds, 15% three-beds, and 15% four-beds. 55 parking spaces will be incorporated into the building for residents. Extending the volume of the bank building, the new building extrudes and elongates that massing to the north, extending the history of the bank. This massing was then carved into programmatic volumes with open space for a ground floor public plaza.  With a vote of confidence from the Permit Review Committee, the development has one more approval secured before work begins. The overall project is expected to go through city approvals for a Planned Development and rezoning. A timeline for construction is currently unknown. ",Humboldt Park,1
Full building permit issued for 438 W. Saint James,"A full building permit has been issued for a residential development at 438 W. Saint James Pl. While the project will not rezone its site or establish Planned Development, the project received a Lakefront Protection Ordinance approval due to its proximity to the lakefront. Located within Lincoln Park, the site is a few blocks north of W. Fullerton Ave and is between N. Clark St and Lincoln Park itself.  Planned by Genna Hill via St. James Interests LLC, the revised project will redevelop the site with a five-story building, down from a ten-story building that was originally planned. Occupying a parcel just 33 feet wide, the new building will host a mere four residential units. The ground floor of the building will provide 5 interior parking spaces. Rising 67 feet tall, architects Hirsch MPG have swapped out the contemporary glassy design for a more modest, brick-clad design. With such a narrow building surrounded on three sides, the street frontage has been setback and will include the residential entry to the west, the parking garage entry in the center, and the second egress exit door to the east side.  While the original 10-story building was approved back in May 2022, the developer decided to scale back the project after talking with neighbors and realizing how difficult it would be to build on the thin site, having to deal with a tower crane and associated logistics for the tiny site. The scaled back building will now be able to be built with wood construction and masonry on the outside, simplifying the construction process. With the caisson permit issued in August, the issuance of the full building permit will allow general contractor G Corp to work on the $5.5 million development through completion. ",Lincoln Park,0
Rendering emerges for development at 4006 N. Sheridan,"A rendering has been released for the recently announced mixed-use development at 4006 N. Sheridan. Planned by Catapult Real Estate Solutions, the project site is at the northwest corner of N. Sheridan Rd and W. Irving Park Rd. The development would replace Holiday Club’s existing building plus apartments and storefronts containing El Palmar restaurant and Roots Smoke & Vapor Shop. While an architect has not been announced, the development will consist of a seven-story mixed-use building. Set to host 92 residential units, the unit mix will include 12 studios, 52 one-beds, and 28 two-beds. At the ground floor, there will be 3,1000 square feet of retail space, with 36 parking spaces included. Residents would have access to 92 bike parking spaces and a rooftop terrace with views of downtown. While the development will proceed under the existing zoning, the development team is seeking variances from the Zoning Board of Appeals. Two variances will allow for the reduction of the building’s required parking spaces and loading berths. A special use application would allow for residential space below the second floor. With the rendering first revealed by Uptown Update, we now know what the proposal looks like. Before moving forward, the developer would need to receive approvals from the ZBA to allow for the scope of the development. A timeline for construction is currently unknown.  ",Uptown,0
1353 W. Fulton gets foundation permit,"A foundation permit has been issued for a mixed-use development 1353 W. Fulton. Planned by Shapack Partners, the development, also known under the address of 220 N. Ada, is located at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Ada St. A demolition permit was issued back in May to clear the site of the existing one-story masonry building on the property.  Rising 314 feet, the project will consist of a 29-story, mixed-use tower with 308 residential units, ground floor retail space, 115 parking spaces, and 58 bike parking spaces. The unit mix will consist of studios, one-beds, and two-beds. With a design from SOM, the building will consist of a three-story podium with a square tower portion rising above oriented along N. Ada St setback from W. Fulton St. The residential entry will front N. Ada St while retail space will span from the residential entry up to W. Fulton St. Amenity space will top the podium and occupy the top floor of the tower. Balconies will dot the facade in a seemingly random pattern that aligns with unit types. The podium will be expressed as two separate massings. The portion under the tower is expressed with a similar materiality and gridding as the tower above. To the north of the tower, the podium at the corner of W. Fulton St and N. Ada St is expressed as a solid volume with brick detailing that creates porosity and creates a play of light and shadow as the sun moves.  The project will meet sustainability goals by achieving a Green Globes 2-Globes certification, installing two EV charging stations, preparing 23 parking spots for EV charging readiness, installing a CTA digital display, and ensuring 80% construction waste diversion.  To meet affordability requirements, the developers will provide 20% of the units as affordable housing on-site at a weighted average of 60% AMI. With the foundation permit in hand, general contractor Clayco Inc can begin construction on the building’s caissons. A full building permit has yet to be filed for the $135 million tower. A timeline for completion of the development is currently unknown. ",Fulton Market,1
741 N. Wells scores full building permit,"After recently breaking ground and scoring foundation permits, a full building permit has been issued for 741 N. Wells. Marking the final procedural hurdle before construction can proceed through completion, developer Vista Property is now fully approved to complete their new tower for the vacated site.  Formerly occupied by a one-story retail building and three-story structure, the new tower will stand just off W. Chicago Ave, offset by a historic brick building that will be retained at 755 N. Wells. With Antunovich Associates in charge of the design, the new mixed-use tower will stand 21 floors, holding 168 residential units and 9,400 square feet of retail space. Rising 255 feet, the apartment mix will consist of 50 studios, 101 one-beds, and 17 two-beds. 51 car parking spaces will be included on the second and third floors, with bike parking provided for 150 bikes. Designed with a contemporary loft vernacular, the building will use floor-to-ceiling glass with a small amount of metal paneling. The front facade will have a subtle serrated edge stepping back from the street to allow for wider southern views. To offer relief on the ground floor for outdoor dining, the retail space will setback in line with the building’s setback.  Tenant amenities will include an interior dog run and dog spa, a fitness center, outdoor fitness space, a club room, coworking space, and an outdoor deck with a pool. The existing building at 755 N. Wells will be retained and used for retail and office space. To meet affordability requirements, the project will include five units on site at 60% AMI and a payment of $2.4 million in lieu of the remaining 13 units. VISTA Property financed the project with a first mortgage loan from Huntington Bank, and has also engaged Luxury Living Chicago Realty, downtown Chicago’s premier marketing, consulting and residential leasing brokerage firm. With Skender in charge of construction, completion is slated for 2024.   ",River North,1
